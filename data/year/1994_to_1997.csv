As expected, protein adsorption was found to depend on the deg ree of hydrophobicity of the surfaces and on the concentration of the surfactant. A reduction of 90% in albumin adsorption on hydrophobic methylated surfaces by 0.05% Tween 20 was achieved, whereas a reduction of only 15% on hydrophilic surfaces was observed. Experiments of time-dependent protein adsorption in both pure protein and protein-surfactant mixtures were conducted to ascertain the stability of physically adsorbed Tween 20 films on intermediate silicon surfaces. It was found that the adsorbed Tween 20 film was robust and there was no evidence of exchange of the Tween molecules with albumin for up to 240 min exposure. Adsorption minima were confirmed to correlate with minima in contact angle and critical micelle concentration (CMC).

Quantification involved direct now cytometric analysis of the heads after the bound complement proteins were indirectly fluorescently tagged by use of a monoclonal antibody against a complement protein: C5b-9, iC3b, C3d, C4d, Bb, C3a, and C1q. Calibration with fluorescein microbead standards demonstrated that the membrane attack complex (SC5b-9) was surface bound on all surfaces and that the surface concentration gradually increased to levels as high as 0.5 mu g/cm(2). Further, the surface bound represented a substantial percentage of the total generated. The iC3b level on polystyrene beads rapidly reached 0.09 mu g/cm(2) and the C3d levels were an order of magnitude less. On agarose beads the iC3b levels continually rose to 0.17 mu g/cm(2) and, as before, the C3d levels were substantially lower. The surface concentration of C4d and Bb on both surfaces were significant but less than 1.0 ng/cm(2). There was minimal evidence of C3a and C1q adsorption for any surface. Use of amino-polystyrene beads moderately reduced the level of bound iC3b, C3d, and SC5b-9, whereas carboxylated beads reduced the levels by almost a factor of two. The appreciable amounts of iC3b and SC5b-9 consistently noted on the artificial surfaces tested in this paper suggests that for these two activation products in vitro analysis of material induced complement activation should also include surface analysis.

Exudates of varying volumes were produced that was comprised of granulocytes, monocytes, immature and mature macrophages, and T-lymphocytes. No B-lymphocytes were observed at any time periods. Cell types were identified by their granularity and positivity to the following antibodies: leucocyte common antigen (LCA, pan leucocyte); CD11b/c (macrophage/monocyte); CD5 (T-lymphocyte); CD45RA (B-lymphocyte); HIS48 (granulocyte); ED2 (mature macrophage); and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1). Monocytes isolated from control rat blood demonstrated a size slightly larger than that of granulocytes but with less granularity. Their size and granularity were followed over increasing time periods. The macrophages elicited by UHMWPE showed a similar pattern, with the exception of an apparently highly granular subpopulation with volumes similar to that of granulocytes but significantly more granular. The granular macrophage subset had a very high degree of ED2 and MCP-1 positivity, and their proportion, compared with other macrophages, was greatest at 2 days. The high MCP-1 expression was accounted for by MCP-1 molecules bound to the surface of a small proportion of macrophages that were activated. It is postulated that this subpopulation was responsible for the synthesis of the MCP-1 and could indicate a mechanism by which monocytes are attracted to the site of an implanted material.

Small intestinal submucosa (SIS), as isolated, is primarily an acellular extracellular matrix material. In an attempt to discover the components of small intestinal submucosa which are able to induce this tissue remodelling, the material was extracted and extracts were tested for the ability to stimulate Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts to synthesize DNA and proliferate. Each of the four different extracts of small intestinal submucosa had measurable cell-stimulating activity when analysed in both a whole cell proliferation assay (alamarBlue dye reduction) and a DNA synthesis assay ([H-3]-thymidine incorporation). Proteins extracted from SIS with 2 M urea induced activity profiles in the two assays which were very similar to the activity profiles of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) in the assays. As well, the changes in cell morphology in response to the extracted proteins mimicked the changes induced by FGF-2. Neutralization experiments with specific antibodies to this growth factor confirmed the presence of FGF-2 and indicated that it was responsible for 60% of the fibroblast-stimulating activity of the urea extract of small intestinal submucosa. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific for FGF-2 detected a reactive doublet at approximately 19 kDa and further confirmed the presence of FGF-2. Cell stimulating activity of proteins extracted from SIS with 4 M guanidine was neutralized by an antibody specific for transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). Changes in the morphology of the fibroblasts exposed to this extract were nearly identical to changes induced by TGF beta. Although no reactive protein band was detected at 25 kDa in nonreduced western blot analysis, several bands were reactive at higher molecular weight. The identity of this TGF beta-related component of small intestinal submucosa is unknown. Identification of FGF-2 and TGF beta-related activities in SIS, two growth factors known to significantly affect critical processes of tissue development and differentiation, provides the opportunity to further elucidate the mechanisms by which this extracellular matrix biomaterial modulates wound healing and tissue remodelling.

The bioelectrocatalytic functions of the enzyme in state 3a-GOx were blocked in the presence of 4 or 5: With 6 acting as electron mediator, the enzyme in state 3a-GOx exhibits bioelectrocatalytic activities for the oxidation of glucose, whereas the bioelectrocatalytic functions of the 3b-GOx state are blocked. The directionality of the enzyme photoswitch is controlled by the affinities of the oxidized electron mediators to diffusionally penetrate the protein and reach appropriate electron transfer distances to oxidize the FADH(2) redox center of the enzyme. In all of the systems, cyclic amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoisomerizable enzyme is accomplished.

Limited information is available on its effect on human cells. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that Bioglass(R) supports viability and proliferation of human bone cells. As a prototype of human bone cells, the osteoblast cell line MG63 was used and propagated on Bioglass(R) disks. MG63 cells also were seeded onto disks made of titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) and of cobalt chrome (Co-Cr-Mo) alloys. The number of viable cells recovered was similar for Bioglass(R), titanium, and polystyrene control surfaces. Significantly fewer cells were recovered from CoCr (P < 0.05) compared to Bioglass(R), Ti-6 Al-4v, and polystyrene surfaces. The proportion of cells undergoing DNA synthesis, estimated by thymidine uptake, was significantly greater on Bioglass(R) and titanium surfaces (P < 0.05) than on the CoCr surface. There were detectable differences in cell morphology on these biomaterials. Functional capacity was tested by assay of osteocalcin production and no differences were detectable among the different biomaterials. This study supports the hypothesis that 45S5 Bioglass(R) provides a favorable environment for human osteoblast proliferation and function.

Recent mathematical models of coagulation which are reviewed here suggest that such materials are impossible. This conclusion, which is certainly consistent with our collective experimental evidence, arises from the calculation that conversion of Factor XI to XIa never drops to zero even at the highest flow rates and with virtually no Factor XIIa bound to a surface. Residual amounts of XIa are still formed which can in principle kick-off the coagulation cascade. Furthermore, if the flow rates and corresponding mass transfer coefficients are low and in spite of these near-vanishing levels of the initiating coagulants, the surprising result is that substantial amounts of thrombin are produced. On the contrary, under slightly higher flow conditions, there can be more substantial levels of initiating coagulants, yet paradoxically thrombin production is near zero. This article presents a theoretical understanding of the events which take place during the interaction of biomaterials with flowing blood. We follow these events from the time of first contact to the final production of thrombin. The effect of flow and surface activity on the contact phase reactions is examined in detail and the two are found to be intertwined. The common pathway is also examined and here the main feature is the existence of three flow dependent regions which produce either high or very low levels of thrombin, as well as multiple thrombin steady states. In a final analysis we link the two segments of the cascade and consider the events which result. In addition, we note that multiple steady states arise only in the presence of two (thrombin) feedback loops. Single loops or the bare cascade will produce only single steady states. With some imagination one can attribute to the feedback loops the role of providing the cascade with a mechanism to produce high thrombin levels in case of acute need (e.g. bleeding) or to allow levels to subside to 'stand-by' when there is no need for clotting. We present this as a partial answer to the question: Why is the coagulation cascade so complex and what is the importance of the feedback loops? (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

Based on this concept, biospecific polymers have been produced synthetically by attaching biospecific 'keys' to the polymer chain. We postulate that biospecificity can be achieved by alternative means, namely random substitution of a preformed polymer with suitable chemical groups or random copolymerization of suitable functional monomers. Such polymers, we suggest, will contain arrangements of the chemical functions which mimic natural biospecific sites and the probability of occurrence of such arrangements will depend on the average composition of the polymer. In support of this principle, we have developed several functional random copolymer systems which possess a variety of biological properties depending on the type of chemical function. Examples are: polymers possessing anticoagulant properties similar to those of heparin; polymers which interact specifically with components of the immune system; and polymers which, in contact with cells, affect their growth and metabolism. In the case of statistical copolymers possessing 'DNA-like' properties obtained by phosphorylation of hydroxylated polystyrene derivatives, Monte Carte simulations were used to determine the distribution of phosphodiester (PDE) groups along the chains and to compute the probabilities of occurrence of particular arrangements of PDE found in the 'DNA-like' sites. The results showed that these sites are made up of PDE groups separated by distances that closely match those between the same groups along a generatrix of the DNA double-helix cylinder. These findings offer the prospect of manufacturing polymeric biomaterials endowed with biomimetic character. Moreover, they provide the basis for a hypothesis regarding the appearance of biospecificity at the origin of life, suggesting that biospecific structures may have evolved by natural selection from purely random copolymers. It is likely therefore that biospecificity is a continuous function of randomness, arising from purely statistical distributions of reactivity and evolving into precisely defined structures such as those involved in ligand-receptor interactions.

We have utilized PAN/PVC guidance channels to form solid human SC grafts which can be transplanted either with or without the channel. We studied the ability of grafts placed with and without channels to support regeneration ansi, to influence functional recovery; characteristics of the graft and host/graft interface wore also compared. The T9-T10 spinal cord of nude rats was resected and a graft was placed across the gap; methylprednisolone was delivered acutely to decrease secondary injury. Channels minimized the immigration of connective tissue into grafts but contributed to some necrotic tissue loss, especially in the distal spinal cord. Grafts without channels contained more myelinated axons ((x) over bar = 2129 +/- 785) vs ((x) over bar = 1442 +/- 514) and were larger in cross-sectional area ((x) over bar = 1.53 +/- 0.24 mm(2)) vs ((x) over bar = 0.95 +/- 0.86 mm(2)). The interfaces formed between the host spinal cord and the grafts placed without channels were highly interdigitated and resembled CNS-PNS transition zones; chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was deposited there. Whereas several neuronal populations including propriospinal, sensory, motoneuronal, and brainstem neurons regenerated into human SC grafts, only propriospinal and sensory neurons were observed to reenter the host spinal cord. Using combinations of anterograde and retrograde tracers, we observed regeneration of propriospinal neurons up to 2.6 mm beyond grafts. We estimate that 1% of the fibers that enter grabs reenter the host spinal cord by 45 days after grafting. Following retrograde tracing from the distal spinal cord, more labeled neurons were unexpectedly found in the region of the dextran amine anterograde tracer injection site where a marked inflammatory reaction had occurred. Animals with bridging grafts obtained modestly higher scores during open field [((x) over bar = 8.2 +/- 0.35) vs ((x) over bar = 6.8 +/- 0.42), P = 0.02] and inclined plane testing (x) over bar = 38.6 +/- 0.542) vs ((x) over bar = 36.3 +/- 0.53), P = 0.006] than animals with similar grafts in distally capped channels, in summary, this study showed that in the nude rat given methylprednisolone in combination with human SC grafts, some regenerative growth occurred beyond the graft and a modest improvement in function was observed, (C) 1997 Academic Press.","Univ Miami, Sch Med, Miami Project Cure Paralysis, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Sch Med, Organ Procurement Team, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Bunge, MB (reprint author), Univ Miami, Sch Med, Miami Project Cure Paralysis, 1600 NW 10th Ave,R-48, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",mbunge@miamiproj.med.miami.edu,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS09923, NS28059]",,,104,217,234,0,15,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4886,1090-2430,,EXP NEUROL,Exp.

These substrates were coated with a primer layer of trichlorovinylsilane (TCVS), which allows grafting of organic polymers. The TCVS-coated substrates were adsorbed with PEO or Pluronics (R) and exposed to 0.3 Mrad of gamma radiation to graft the polymer to the surface. PEO-grafted substrates were characterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fibrinogen adsorption, and platelet adhesion and activation. Surface modification with PEO reduced fibrinogen adsorption by as much as 99%. Platelet adhesion was significantly reduced or prevented on the modified surfaces. Protein-and platelet-resistance effects were independent of hydrophilicity of the PEO-grafted surfaces.

As the material degrades or absorbs, in vitro or in vivo, it undergoes structural, physical, and chemical changes. These changes in the base material may significantly impact the performance of a particular biomedical device; hence, it is important that the investigator consider the full range of properties that constitute the lifetime of a given absorbable material. The long term degradation study presented here sought to identify. one such property, the change in water retention of a degrading oriented polylactide film. The investigation found through differential scanning calorimetry that later stages of degradation are often characterized by a stronger retention of water, potentially due to a higher number of polar carboxyl groups within the relatively hydrophobic polymer matrix.

We have prepared several pHEMA-based biomaterials suitable as bone substitutes; alkaline phosphatase, for example, when immobilized in pHEMA in a copolymerization technique at 4 degrees C retains its biological activity. When pellets of the biomaterial were placed in synthetic body fluids or tissue culture medium containing organic phosphates, numerous calcified nodules formed spontaneously. Osteoblast-like cells harvested on pHEMA or pHEMA/alkaline phosphatase materials can spread and establish direct contacts. However, the hydrophilicity of pHEMA is a real handicap for preparing scanning and transmission electron microscopic analyses. We have found that 2-propanol was an excellent dehydrating preparing for scanning electron microscopy before critical point drying. HEMA itself was found to dehydrate the transmission electron microscopy blocks because it can copolymerize with the methacrylate-based embedding resin Lowicryl K4M.

These cells, upon interaction with any foreign material, might initiate a spectrum of responses, which could lead to acute and chronic inflammatory changes affecting the biocompatibility of the implant. Whether the mechanisms governing the type of evolving inflammatory reaction could be attributed to the macrophages functional differentiation mirrored by monocyte subsets during the polymer interaction, is poorly described. This in vitro study, therefore, attempted to investigate whether different biomaterials influence monocyte cellular activity, determined by the myeloperoxidase level and mitochondrial XTT cleavage, and phenotype dynamics characterized by the presence of CD14, RM 3/1 and 27E10 antigens. It is shown that different polymers exert differential potential to influence monocytes, both in their cellular activity and their phenotypic pattern.

Osteoblasts lining the distal surface of the newly formed bone were stained with all three RNA probes, although weaker than in the THA sample. Some of the osteoblasts were flattened. We concluded from the appearance of the osteoblasts that the bone formation in the nacre samples had progressed beyond the phase of maximal synthetic activity.

The essential features of this system are that the force sensitivity is in the sub-piconewton range and the gap distance between interacting stylus and the sample surfaces can be controlled with nanometer accuracy. We have achieved these technical improvements by using flexible handmade cantilevers with the spring constant of approximately 0.1 pN nm(-1). Thermal bending motions have been reduced to less than 1 nm in root-mean-square amplitude by exerting feedback forces with a laser radiation pressure. The performance of this newly developed scanning probe microscopy was tested by measuring electrostatic repulsive forces in solution. Intermolecular forces in the sub-piconewton range were resolved at controlled gaps in the nanometer range between an amino-silanized stylus and an amino-silanized glass surface, Force curves as a function of gap distance coincided well with the theory of electricity. Debye lengths calculated at various ionic strengths were in good agreement with the Debye-Huckel theory. Furthermore, non-contact two-dimensional images mapped with electrostatic forces within the piconewton range could also be obtained. This system should prove useful not only for constructing the surface topographies of soft biomaterials but also for mapping the surfaces with intermolecular forces which are closely related to their functions.","Osaka Univ, Dept Biophys Engn, Osaka 560, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Exploratory Res Adv Technol, BioMotron Project, Osaka 562, Japan; Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Osaka 565, Japan","Yanagida, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Dept Biophys Engn, Machikaneyana 1-3, Osaka 560, Japan.",,"Yanagida, Toshio/D-1919-2009",,,,,25,22,23,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3991,,,ULTRAMICROSCOPY,Ultramicroscopy,DEC,1997.0,70,1-2,,,,,45,55,,10.1016/S0304-3991(97)00069-7,,,,11,Microscopy,Microscopy,YP468,WOS:000071279800005,,,,,2019-02-25

PTFE films were photochemically reduced by exposure to short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light in the presence of the reducing agents, i.e., diphenyl ketyl radical anion, generated from a solution of benzophenone and sodium hydride in dimethylformamide (Noh et al., J. Polym. Sci. A, Polym. Chem., 35, 1499 (1997)). The photochemically reduced PTFE films were subsequently modified by photograft polymerization of acrylic acid, acrylamide, and poly(ethylene glycol) monoacrylate (PEG-Ac) by employing long wavelength UV irradiation with benzil dimethyl ketal as an initiator. The photochemically reduced PTFE films were good substrates for photograft polymerization, leading to surfaces with chemical compositions close to those of the respective homopolymers as determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Photograft polymerization of PEG-Ac on the photochemically reduced surface was also explored with different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8%; v/v) and molecular weights (200, 400, 1000, and 2000 g/mol) of PEG-Ac, different durations (5, 10, and 20 min) of long wavelength UV irradiation, and different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8%; v/v) of benzil dimethyl ketal. Higher concentrations and lower molecular weights of PEG-Ac generally led to more extensive photo raft polymerization, whereas the concentration of benzil dimethyl ketal and duration of UV irradiation did not substantially influence the extent of photograft polymerization.

J,"Deming, TJ",,,,"Deming, TJ",,,Facile synthesis of block copolypeptides of defined architecture,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ANHYDRIDES; ACID,"Many natural polymeric materials (particularly structural proteins) display a hierarchy of structure over several length scales. Block copolymers are able to self-assemble into ordered nanostructures(1,2), but the random-coiled nature of their polymer chains usually suppresses any further levels of organization. The use of components with regular structures, such as rigid-rod polymers, can increase the extent of spatial organization in self-assembling materials(3). But the synthesis of such polymeric components typically involves complicated reaction steps that are not suitable for large-scale production. Proteins form hierarchically organized structures in which the fundamental motifs are generally alpha-helical coils and beta-sheets(4). Attempts to synthesize polypeptides with well-defined amino-acid sequences, which might adopt similar organized structures, have been plagued by unwanted side reactions(5) that give rise to products with a wide range of molecular weights(6-10), hampering the formation of well-defined peptide block copolymers(11-17). Here I describe a polymerization strategy that overcomes these difficulties by using organonickel initiators which suppress chain-transfer and termination side reactions. This approach allows the facile synthesis of block copolypeptides with well-defined sequences, which might provide new peptide-based biomaterials with potential applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and biomimetic composite formation.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT CHEM,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106","Deming, TJ (reprint author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT MAT,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106, USA.",,"Deming, Timothy/I-5411-2013","Deming, Timothy/0000-0002-0594-5025",,,,25,450,456,1,173,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,NOV 27,1997.0,390,6658,,,,,386,389,,10.1038/37084,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,YH549,WOS:A1997YH54900058,9389476.0,,,,2019-02-25

Microparticles were not formed in the absence of protein. Instead, the phase containing starch separated after agglomeration. Thus, stabilization/hydrophobization of the starch surface by silicone alone was not possible. However, there is a strong affinity between the silicone and the protein particularly in the case of the PDMS-TES and, simultaneously, an affinity between the PDMS-TES and the starch that leads to a stabilization of the starch surface. This could most clearly be seen from immunological data that showed that antibodies were elicited by protein in the microparticles coated with PDMS-TES following oral administration.","MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT PATHOL, HAMILTON, ON L8N 3Z5, CANADA","Brook, MA (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT CHEM, 1280 MAIN ST W, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4M1, CANADA.",,,,,,,75,11,11,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,NOV 12,1997.0,13,23,,,,,6279,6286,,10.1021/la970419b,,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,YG702,WOS:A1997YG70200044,,,,,2019-02-25

This literature review examines these lenses from both a basic science and a clinical perspective. By most parameters, hydrogel, soft acrylic and silicone IOL are better than polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses. Plate haptic silicone IOL have the lowest incidence of cystoid macula oedema and posterior capsule opacification, but these lenses require an intact anterior capsularhexis and posterior capsule. Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy must be delayed at least 3 months to avoid posterior lens dislocation. Silicone has the lowest threshold for YAG laser damage of all IOL materials and also adheres irreversibly to silicone oil with subsequent optical impairment. Three piece silicone IOL with polypropylene haptics have a higher incidence of decentration, pigment adherence and capsule opacification compared with PMMA haptics. Hydrogel lenses are very biocompatible and resistant to YAG laser damage, but pigment adheres to the surface more readily than PMMA. Soft acrylic IOL unfold slowly, resulting in controlled insertion, but it is possible to crack the lens and some lenses develop glistenings due to water accumulation. There are significant socioeconomic implications to the large differences in posterior capsule opacification rates between the various biomaterials and the lens styles.","CHRISTCHURCH HOSP,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,CHRISTCHURCH,NEW ZEALAND",,,,,,,,77,58,63,2,33,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN COLL OPHTHAL,SYDNEY,"27 COMMONWEALTH ST, SYDNEY NSW 2010, AUSTRALIA",0814-9763,,,AUST NZ J OPHTHALMOL,Aust.

The activity of immobilized hirudin on the polymer was estimated by a chromogenic assay to about 2.5 ATU r-Hir cm(-2). The improvement of the haemocompatibility of the modified RG756 was evaluated in terms of platelet adhesion/activation, whole blood clotting times and clot formation rate. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that surface modification with r-Hir resulted in decreased platelet adhesion and activation. An ELISA for P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, was used to confirm this result. Clotting time experiments demonstrated significantly prolonged non-activated partial thromboplastin times, and a decreased clot formation rate of whole blood in contact with r-Hir modified RG756 compared with the plain polymer. Comparison of immobilized r-Hir with bound heparin yielded equivalent improvement of blood-contacting properties of the investigated polymers.

Percentage integration and bone area data from six horizontal sections along the entire length of each implant were collected and analyzed for differences between jaws, implant biomaterials, jaw/biomaterial, and sections of the implants (ANOVA, pairwise comparison using LSM with Bonferroni adjustment). The results indicated that overall mean percentage integration was 46.5 and mean percentage bone area was 39.9. Maxillary and mandibular differences for both parameters were statistically different (integration: maxillary = 38.1%, mandibular = 56.7%; bone area: maxillary = 35.8%, mandibular = 44.9%; both were significant at the P < .05 level). The biomaterial analyses revealed significant differences for percentage integration between the metal implants and the hydroxyapatite-coated implant (commercially pure titanium = 39.1%, titanium-aluminum-vanadium = 40.0%, hydroxyapatite-coated = 61.5%), but no such difference was noted for percentage bone area (commercially pure titanium = 38.8%, titanium-aluminum-vanadium = 38.9%, hydroxyapatite-coated = 42.3%). Discussion of the relative importance of the two parameters highlights the fact that resistance to functional loads requires establishing and then maintaining an adequate volume of bone, which may have a functionally specific structure based on the mechanical properties of the local jaw environment.","UNIV TENNESSEE, MED CTR, KNOXVILLE, TN USA","Carr, AB (reprint author), OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, 305 W 12TH AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.",,,"Carr, Alan/0000-0002-7944-4143",,,,28,18,19,0,1,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Operational stability, or retention of biological activity, of biochemically modified biomaterials is a fundamental determinant of their usefulness. The present study investigated retention of enzymatic activity immobilized on silanized Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. A model enzyme, trypsin, was immobilized on monolayers and multilayers of silane deposited from aqueous or organic solutions of gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS). Trypsin-conjugated biomaterials were incubated in cell culture medium at 37 degrees C for up to 96 h, and the residual immobilized activity was measured. Retention of bioactivity in physiological saline was dependent on the type of material and on the method of silanization. Activity of enzyme adsorbed on the metals was lost within 24-48 h. Both mono-and multilayers of APS deposited on Co-Cr-Mo by aqueous silanization effectively retained enzymatic activity throughout the 96 h incubation period. The monolayer retained approximately 23% of the activity initially present, and the multilayers retained approximately 50% of the initial activity. Organic silanization of Co-Cr-Mo was marginally effective as it initially slowed the loss of activity. However, all activity was lost by 48-72 h of incubation. Neither organic nor aqueous silanization enhanced retention of enzymatic activity on Ti-6Al-4V.

A photochemical method is presented to couple phosphorylcholine-containing aryl azides to poly(etherurethane) surfaces (PEUs). Two aryl azides that consist of a photoactivatable 4-azidobenzoyl group, a short spacer chain, and a phosphorylcholine endgroup were synthesized. The two compounds differ only in the type of spacer used: triethylene glycol for compound 1 and hexanediol for compound 2. These compounds were physically adsorbed to PEU surfaces. Upon UV irradiation, reactive intermediates are formed that react with nucleophilic groups on the polymer surface. The modified surfaces showed decreased underwater contact angles, indicating that hydrophilic phosphorylcholine groups are present at the surface. ESCA measurements showed the presence of phosphorus and positively charged nitrogen atoms in the outermost polymer layers (analyzed depth about 50 Angstrom), which is a strong indication of the presence of phosphorylcholine groups. Hemocompatibility in vitro was tested with thrombin generation assays and platelet adhesion tests. In thrombin generation assays the clotting time of platelet-rich plasma in contact with the polymer surface is determined. Clotting times were clearly prolonged for the modified surfaces. Surfaces modified with compound 2 showed slightly higher clotting times than those modified with compound 1. Repeated surface modification with compound 2 further increased the clotting time. For the tested surfaces an increase in the clotting time corresponds to an increase in the concentration of phosphorylcholine groups at the surface (as measured by ESCA and contact angle). Platelet adhesion studies with scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that fewer platelets (showing less activation) adhered to the modified surfaces than to the unmodified polyurethane.

These quantitative differences were supported by LM and ultrastructural observations of the interface.

Mechanical properties were determined using tensile testing and dynamic mechanical analysis, whereas resistance to encrustation was examined using an in vitro model for encrustation simulating in vivo encrustation. Maximum and minimum tensile strength at break, Young's modulus, storage and loss moduli were associated with PMMA and PU, respectively. IPNs demonstrated intermediate mechanical properties which were dependent on the concentrations of the component polymers. Conversely, maximum elongation at break was observed for PU and this parameter decreased as the concentration of PMMA increased in the IPN. The dynamic mechanical damping parameter, tan delta, was similar for all IPNs at 37 degrees C. Increased advancing and decreased receding contact angles were observed for IPNs in comparison with the native PU. The rate and extent of encrustation, measured as the percentage surface coverage, was similar for PU, IPNs and PMMA. In contrast, encrustation on polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, a model hydrogel, was greater than observed for the IPNs or component polymers. No apparent correlation was observed between the rate and/or extent of encrustation and polymer contact angle. It is concluded that these IPNs may be of clinical benefit in patients providing stent resistance to extrinsic compression of the ureter in comparison with native PU. The comparable resistance to encrustation between the IPNs and PU indicates:that the use of IPNs should not be restricted in this regard.","UNIV ULSTER, SCH ELECT & MECH ENGN, NEWTOWNABBEY BT37 0QB, NORTH IRELAND; BELFAST CITY HOSP, DEPT UROL, BELFAST BT9 7BL, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND","Jones, DS (reprint author), QUEENS UNIV BELFAST, CTR MED BIOL, SCH PHARM, BELFAST BT9 7BL, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND.",,,,,,,23,29,30,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Free-radical polymerization was carried out in aqueous solution at 70 degrees C using the water-soluble initiator, 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride. The supported monolayer displayed advancing and receding water contact angles of 58 degrees and 31 degrees, respectively. Angle-dependent electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) results confirmed the presence of phosphorus and nitrogen and was consistent with theoretical predictions for a close-packed monolayer. Ellipsometry measurements indicated a film thickness of 134 Angstrom. In the absence of network formation, polymeric films demonstrated acceptable stability under static conditions in water. For comparative analysis, the phospholipid was also fused and polymerized onto a self-assembled monolayer of octadecyl mercaptan (ODT) bound to gold. ESCA data were consistent with a close packed monolayer and ellipsometry revealed a film thickness of 66 Angstrom. Nonetheless, contact angle measurements demonstrated that the polymerized lipid monolayer when supported on an ODT surface exhibited a higher level of instability over time than that supported by the amphiphilic terpolymer.","EMORY UNIV,DEPT SURG,SCH MED,LAB BIOMOL MAT RES,ATLANTA,GA 30322; GEORGIA INST TECHNOL,SCH CHEM ENGN,ATLANTA,GA 30320",,,,"Marra, Kacey/0000-0002-8437-4864",,,,33,36,36,0,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,OCT 15,1997.0,13,21,,,,,5697,5701,,10.1021/la970473s,,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,YB530,WOS:A1997YB53000030,,,,,2019-02-25

These materials have been developed for use as polymer scaffolds in tissue engineering, which have cell-adhesion resistant, ligand-immobilizable, and biodegradable characteristics. The GL-PEG cross-linked polymer networks obtained were glassy and transparent, and the gel content was approximately 90%, irrespective of the degree of polymerization of lactide on the glycerol center and the amount and molecular weight of the PEG acrylate incorporated. All networks showed relatively low swelling in water, due to their highly cross-linked nature. They had no melting endotherms, but they displayed glass transition temperatures indicative of phase-mixing of the PEG. Analysis by ESCA, contact angle measurement, and cell culture indicated the presence of PEG at the network surfaces and showed that higher molecular weight PEG was incorporated into the network surfaces to a higher extent, rendered the surfaces more hydrophilic, and repelled cell adhesion more effectively than did PEG of lower molecular weights. All GL networks showed much less adhesion and spreading of human foreskin fibroblasts than glass used as a control: In particular, GL-PEG networks were highly resistant to cell adhesion due to the mobile PEG chains. Given that the terminal hydroxyl function on the incorporated PEG can be readily derivatized with a bioactive peptide, these degradable networks should be useful as polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering.","ETH ZURICH, INST BIOMED ENGN, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND; UNIV ZURICH, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND; ETH ZURICH, DEPT MAT, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND; CALTECH, DIV CHEM & CHEM ENGN, PASADENA, CA 91125 USA; KOREA INST SCI & TECHNOL, BIOMAT RES CTR, SEOUL 130650, SOUTH KOREA",,,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456; Han, Dong Keun/0000-0003-4641-7883",,,,42,147,155,2,47,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,OCT 6,1997.0,30,20,,,,,6077,6083,,10.1021/ma970302u,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,YA289,WOS:A1997YA28900015,,,,,2019-02-25

The volumetric and mechanical properties were assessed with a three-dimensional modeling of Pebax sacs and computerized simulations of their systolic distortions for both right and left ventricular configurations. The stresses and strains of these sacs were represented as quantitative mappings for a maximum end-systolic state and were below the respective threshold values above which the Pebau material is jeopardized for permanent structure impairment. After fatigue tests applied on Pebau strips under the alleged working conditions of Pebax sacs, the material structure was unchanged and maintained its intrinsic mechanical properties. The theoretical maximum stroke volumes were 74.4 cm(3) and 62.4 cm(3) for the left and right ventricular configurations, respectively.

This experimental system is important in understanding mineralization in ordered organic media, a phenomenon of importance in biology and possibly in biomaterials technology as well. The first step in the process involves the doping of a mesophase with precursor ions for the mineral phase with little disruption of the order parameter. Growth of the mineral crystals is then induced by establishing interfacial contact between mesophases doped with different precursor ions. In the system studied here, mineralization occurs at the interface as a result of diffusion of calcium and phosphate ions toward regions of lower concentration. Characterization of the precipitate formed at the interface by X-ray as well as electron diffraction, elemental analysis, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy has revealed the formation of single crystals of brushite (CaHPO4.2H(2)O) with triangular and platelike morphology. Most importantly, these crystals exhibited longitudinal striations on their surface which are believed to be due a templating effect from the liquid-crystalline phase. The striations are most likely an imprint of the preferred orientation of cylindrical molecular assemblies in the hexagonal mesophase.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CHEM,MAT RES LAB,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,MAT RES LAB,URBANA,IL 61801",,,"Stupp, Samuel/B-6737-2009",,,,,29,8,11,1,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Development of a novel biodurable polyurethane surface to which biological agents, such as growth factors or anticoagulants could be covalently bound, would be beneficial. The purpose of this study was to synthesize a novel poly(carbonate urea) urethane polymer with carboxylic acid groups which would serve as ''anchor'' sites for protein attachment. Physical characteristics such as tensile strength, initial modulus, ultimate elongation, tear strength, water/alcohol uptake and water vapor permeation were then evaluated and compared to other biomedical-grade polyurethanes. Covalent linkage of the blood protein albumin to this novel surface was then examined. A biodurable polycarbonate-based polyurethane containing carboxylic acid groups (cPU) was synthesized using a two step procedure incorporating the chain extender 2,2-bis (hydroxymethyl)-propionic acid (DHMPA). Tensile strength of this cPU film was 2.7 and 2.6 fold greater than both a polycarbonate-based polyurethane synthesized with a 1,4-butanediol chain extender (bdPU) and Mitrathane (Mit) controls, respectively. The cPU polymer also possessed 7.8 and 31 fold greater structural rigidity upon evaluation of initial modulus as compared to the bdPU and Mit, respectively. Ultimate elongation for the bdPU films was slightly higher than the cPU and Mit films, which had comparable elongation properties. The force required to tear the bdPU film was 1.9 and 32 fold greater than the cPU and Mit films, respectively. Alcohol solution uptake by all of the polyurethane segments increased with increasing alcohol concentrations, with the cPU having the greatest uptake. Water uptake was minimal for all the polyurethanes examined and was not affected by altering pH. Water vapor permeation was lowest for the cPU films as compared to both bdPU and Mit. Swelling the cPU in 50% ethanol prior to evaluation slightly increased water vapor permeation through the films. Covalent linkage of the radiolabelled blood protein albumin (I-125-BSA) to the cPU segments incubated with the heterobifunctional crosslinker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was greatest in the higher percent of ethanol as compared to controls.

Our results showed good biological tolerance of both prostheses and a high degree of adhesion formation in Marlex implants. In animals with Dual Mesh(R) implants, only loose adhesions were seen. Marlex implants induced the presence of disorganized scar tissue, while the Dual Mesh prostheses were encapsulated by organized tissue. The macrophage response was similar in both decreasing with time. The resistance to traction was higher when the reparation was done with polypropylene.

This study examined the adherence of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis to commercially available polyurethane and silicone peritoneal catheters in the presence and absence of a proteinaceous conditioning film. In addition, the effects of the conditioning film on the surface properties (advancing and receding contact angles, and surface rugosity) of these biomaterials were investigated. Bacterial adherence to polyurethane and silicone catheters, pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or artificial spent peritoneal dialysate (ASD) for 1 h at 37 degrees C, was examined using a radiometric (2-H-3-adenine) adherence assay. The advancing and receding contact angles and the surface rugosity of ASD- and PBS-treated biomaterials were examined using a dynamic contact angle analyser and an atomic force microscope, respectively. The bacterial isolates were selected to represent high and low cell surface hydrophobicity. The hydrophobic isolate exhibited both a significantly greater rate and a significantly greater extent of adherence than the hydrophilic isolate to both catheter materials, independent of pre-treatment. In general, pre-treatment of the catheter materials with ASD significantly decreased the subsequent adherence of both isolates owing to the deposition of a conditioning film on the surface of the biomaterial. ASD treatment also decreased both the advancing and receding contact angles and the surface rugosity of both catheter materials. This study highlights the influence of both bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and biomaterial surface conditioning films on bacterial adherence to CAPD catheters.

Biomaterials often show adsorption of fibrinogen and subsequent formation of fibrin. Plasminogen's function in vivo could be adapted to facilitate its activation and fibrinolytic function on a biomaterial surface. In order to elucidate plasminogen function adsorbed to a model fibrinolytic surface ligands known to affect plasminogen properties in solution were attached to model silica surfaces to study the effects of immobilized ligands as fibrinolytic activators. Model silica surfaces were synthesized which contained covalently attached lysine moieties (surface I), sulfonate moieties (surface II) or a combination of both (surface III). Lysine moieties on these model surfaces interact specifically with multiple lysine binding sites of plasminogen and induce a number of changes in conformation and function. Sulfonate moieties interact non-specifically with accessible lysine and arginine residues of plasminogen and also affect the function of plasminogen. Inherent physico-chemical properties monitored following plasminogen adsorption were activation to plasmin, enzymatic activity, fluorescent intensity, and fluorescent polarization, monitored br total internal reflection fluorescence, each of which are affected by plasminogen conformation. Correlations were as follows: increased fluorescent intensity and decreased fluorescent polarization were indicative of plasminogen conformational changes and are correlated to increased enzymatic activity of plasmin. Surfaces I and III showed a 20% increase in fluorescent intensity, and a 25% and 8% decrease in fluorescent polarization, respectively, in comparison to surface II. The specific activity for surfaces I and III was increased 11.3 and 1.8 fold above that found for surface II. Plasminogen incubated with sulfonate groups in solution resulted in no increase in fluorescent intensity and a slight decrease in fluorescent polarization as compared with plasminogen alone and reduced specific activity of plasmin in the presence of sulfonate as compared with plasmin alone. Lysine or E-aminocaproic acid (ACA) incubated with plasmin in solution showed a 30% and 10% increase in fluorescent intensity, a 24% and 5% decrease in fluorescent intensity, and maximum specific activity increased 3.6 and 2.5 fold, respectively, over plasminogen alone. Interactions of plasminogen with ligands for its lysine-binding sites produced dramatic effects both in solution and adsorbed to model fibrinolytic surfaces. The characterization of these interactions along with known fibrin interactions will allow selection of appropriate surface modifications to enhance the fibrinolysis of thrombus formed at a biomaterial interface. These modifications may lead to a native-like surface structure to protein and cellular components of blood and create a more biocompatible surface.

The use of these methods can provide information on the biodegradation product profiles and yield concentration levels for the isolated products. The latter information is required to assess the toxicological nature of biomaterials and their related degradation products. In this study a model biomedical polyurethane was synthesized with toluene diisocyanate, polyester diol and ethylene diamine, and then incubated at 37 degrees C in a biological solution containing enzyme. The biodegradation products were isolated from the in vitro system and prepared for HPLC analysis, by using a combination of ultrafiltration, freeze drying and liquid-solid extraction. The ultrafiltration and the liquid-solid extraction effectively removed protein contamination. The separation of more than 20 degradation products, with gradient HPLC, was optimized using a photodiode array detector. The separated degradation products were identified using a tandem mass spectrometer. The model polyurethane was labeled with C-14 in different segments, in order to assist in confirming the efficiency of the sample preparation and isolation methods. A detection limit of 2 ng was found. No toluene diamine - a suspected human carcinogen associated with some medical implants - could be found in the test samples. This represents a significant finding since the amount of this injected sample actually contained a total of 28 mu g of degradation products isolated from the incubation medium.

In the limit of a perfectly smooth hydroxyapatite (HA) surface, a tensile test of the bone-HA interface affords an opportunity to isolate the bonding contribution related to HA surface chemistry alone. This study measured the bone-HA interfacial tensile strength for highly polished (similar to 0.05 mu m alumina) dense HA disks (5.25 mm in diameter, 1.3 in mm thickness) in rabbit tibiae. Each of five rabbits received four HA disks, two per proximal tibia. Pull-off loads ranged from 3.14 +/- 2.38N at 55 days after implantation to 18.35 +/- 11.9N at 88 days; nominal interfacial tensile strengths were 0.15 +/- 0.11 MPa and 0.85 +/- 0.55 MPa, respectively. SEM of failed interfaces revealed failures between HA and bone, within the HA itself and within adjacent bone. Tissue remnants on HA were identified as mineralized bone with either a lamellar or trabecular structure. Oriented collagen fibers in the bone intricately interdigitated with the HA surface, which frequently showed breakdown at material grain boundaries and a rougher surface than originally implanted. Mechanical interlocking could not be eliminated as a mode of tissue attachment and contribution to bone-HA bonding, even after implanting an extremely smooth HA surface.

Under optimal conditions, the shrinkage temperature (T-s) was raised to 74 degrees C for collagen crosslinked with DMS and to 80 degrees C for those crosslinked with GTA. Crosslinking density measurements were done on the hydrothermally denatured collagen by the method based on the Flory-Rehner equation. GTA treatment was found to introduce more number of crosslinks than DMS. The maximum tension attained during heating (after shrinkage has occurred) was greater for GTA-treated collagen than for DMS and control. The control collagen membranes broke during heating (at 73 degrees C), while for the crosslinked membranes the tension kept on increasing up to 100 degrees C. The crosslinking density correlated well with the data determined from the in vitro and in vivo degradation studies. Uncrosslinked and DMS crosslinked collagen membranes were more susceptible to degradation by enzymes in vitro, while GTA-treated collagen was highly resistant to degradation. The biocompatibility of the collagen membranes was studied by subcutaneous implantation in rats. Uncrosslinked collagen membranes degraded within 14 days with the formation of granulation tissue. DMS crosslinked membranes degraded within 21 days and the area was replaced by numerous fibroblasts and newly formed collagen. No calcification was observed. For GTA-treated membranes, necrosis was observed after 7 days implantation and by 14 days the membrane had started to calcify.

A series of five polyurethanes were made from the macrodiols poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG), poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO), poly (hexamethylene oxide) (PHMO), poly(octamethylene oxide) (POMO), and poly(decamethylene oxide) (PDMO). In the sequence the macrodiols become less polar and phase separation in the polymer increases, creating a range of hydrophilicity. These five polyurethanes were studied along with commercial Pellethane 2363-80A. The materials were implanted intramuscularly into rats for 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months. The inflammatory response was analyzed using a combination of immunohistochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and image analysis to determine the specific cell types involved in the response and to quantify these cellular responses. The presence of three cytokines also was investigated. The cell types targeted were neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T and B lymphocytes. The cytokines target were tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). All samples were positive for macrophages and activated macrophages, TNF alpha, and MCP-1, and negative for all other antibodies. The response was sustained throughout the implantation period with no significant difference among the samples except at the 7-day time point. The study demonstrated an absence of lymphocytes and neutrophils in a response that was sustained in terms of macrophages with the presence of TNF alpha and MCP-1 and the absence of IL-6. The position of subsets of macrophages with respect to increasing distance from the implants was demonstrated to be significant and consistent within this series of polyurethanes.

Human skin is chosen as an example of living tissue. The cells suitable for the measurement of various layers of human skin and calculation procedures for the waveform reflected from the probe end are described. The approach was confirmed to be effective for the determination of the water content through measurement of the standard samples, keratin-water mixtures. This method was also applied to human skin in vivo. Water content data measured with a probe specially designed for surface layer analysis were sensitive to humidity around the subject. The formula expressing the relation between the electrical field character of the probe, the permittivity depth profile, and the measured permittivity was used to analyze the water content profile as a function of the depth from the skin surface. The use of several kinds of probes, differing in their electric field characteristics, permitted evaluation of the water content depth profile of human skin. This procedure is easy and applicable to any sample due to its simplicity. The measurement needs only a touch of the probe on a sample spot. It is therefore a promising method of physicochemical research on living organisms and biomaterials.

The combination of Al2O3 and UHMWPE are the materials of choice for the acetabular bearing in artificial joints, which have proven to be clinically reliable for over 10 years. Previous studies have examined the biocompatibility of Al2O3 and UHMWPE as bulky implant materials. The present study investigated this material as a blood-contacting material using a standard assessment in vitro and in vivo analysis. The examined items were systemic toxicity, sensitization (guinea pig maximization test), cytotoxicity (elution test), mutagenicity (Ames test), direct contact hemolysis, and thrombogenicity. The studies were performed according to the United States Pharmacopoeia and published previous studies. The samples of both Al2O3 and UHMWPE demonstrated no differences from the negative controls in all tests. These findings indicate that both Al2O3 and UHMWPE are biocompatible materials for double-pivot bearings in the centrifugal blood pump.

The abilities of these three materials to stimulate alveolar macrophages were compared. Non-treated and lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages were used as control. The level of macrophage activation was determined by nitrite and prostaglandin E-2 assay and respiratory burst measurement by chemiluminescence. The results of these studies showed different macrophage responses to these three relatively similar stimuli. Two of the studied materials were shown to be potent activators of respiratory burst and prostaglandin E-2 secretion without any significant release of nitric oxide. On the contrary, the material characterized as the most surface reactive strongly affected only nitric oxide generation by the cells. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

The purpose of this study was to measure reverse-torque failure after 6 months of healing for three different biomaterials in the posterior jaws of four adult female baboons. The animals had all of their posterior teeth surgically extracted and, following 10 weeks of healing, 7 implants were placed in each quadrant. The biomaterials included titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces, titanium-aluminum-vanadium surfaces (both 3.8 mm x 10 mm), and a commercially pure titanium surface (3.75 mm x 10 mm). After 6 months, torque data were collected using a counterclockwise computerized torque driver and were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance for differences related to biomaterial, jaw and biomaterial/jaw. Post-hoc Tukey Kramer analysis was also performed for within-group differences (alpha = .05 level). The biomaterial comparison revealed a significant difference between the titanium plasma-sprayed and the combined commercially pure titanium/titanium-aluminum-vanadium groups (analysis of variance, Tukey Kramer, P < .05). The jaw comparison showed no significant difference, although the data suggest that higher forces may be required for mandibular torsional failure. The biomaterial/jaw comparison revealed that jaw differences for the mean values of commercially pure titanium and titanium-aluminum-vanadium implants were greater than jaw differences for mean values of titanium plasma-sprayed implants, although these differences were not statistically significant. Because of the lack of correlation between single-cycle biomechanical tests and clinical performance, it is necessary to be selective in assigning usefulness to data of this type.","OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, SECT ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA; OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, SECT ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA","Carr, AB (reprint author), OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, SECT RESTORAT DENT PROSTHODONT & ENDODONT DENT, 305 W 12TH AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.",,,"Carr, Alan/0000-0002-7944-4143",,,,23,18,19,0,4,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

The subjects of this review are the materials, and to a lesser extent, the design aspects of the numerous implants that are available to the surgeon in dealing with the ailing spine. Often it is the material aspects of such devices that are responsible for their success or failure. It may be that osteoconductive properties are desired for implants to assist fusion, whereas as inert a material as possible would be preferred for interpositional barriers. The materials composing the instrumentation used to facilitate healing of spinal fractures would ideally have properties that optimize strength and biocompatibility, while at the same time minimizing imaging artifacts and allowing a gradual transfer of load from the instrumentation to the vertebral body (i.e., viscoelastic effects). The application of biomaterials and biomechanics to the design of spinal devices is obvious; what may be more subtle though is what the in vivo interactions of these will be. The study of such aspects must continue in order to better evolve the designs and subsequent results of implanted spinal devices. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

It has been stated that the multinucleated cells which contain wear particles are not bone-resorbing osteoclasts. To investigate the validity of this claim we isolated human osteoclasts from giant-cell tumours of bone and rat osteoclasts from long bones. These were cultured on glass coverslips and on cortical bone slices in the presence of particles of latex, PMMA and titanium. Osteoclast phagocytosis of these particle types was shown by light microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and SEM. Giant cells containing phagocytosed particles were seen to be associated with the formation of resorption lacunae. Osteoclasts containing particles were also calcitonin-receptor-positive and showed an inhibitory response to calcitonin. Our findings demonstrate that osteoclasts are capable of phagocytosing particles of a wide range of size, including particles of polymeric and metallic biomaterials found in periprosthetic tissues, and that after particle phagocytosis, they remain fully functional, hormone-responsive, bone-resorbing cells.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND",,,"Simpson, Alasdair/F-1887-2013","Simpson, Alasdair/0000-0001-7793-642X; Ferguson, David/0000-0001-5045-819X",,,,34,73,73,0,2,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",0301-620X,2044-5377,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

In biological systems, this tool is often used to create microstructures in which the organic manipulators are a minority component. Three groups of materials-biomaterials, ceramics, and semiconductors-have been selected to illustrate this concept as used by nature and by synthetic laboratories exploring its potential in materials technology. In some of nature's biomaterials, macromolecules such as proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides are used to control nucleation and growth of mineral phases and thus manipulate microstructure and physical properties. This concept has been used synthetically to generate apatite-based materials that can function as artificial bone in humans. Synthetic polymers and surfactants can also drastically change the morphology of ceramic particles, impart new functional properties, and provide new processing methods for the formation of useful objects. Interesting opportunities also exist in creating semiconducting materials in which molecular manipulators connect quantum dots or template cavities, which change their electronic properties and functionality.","UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,MAT RES LAB,DEPT CHEM,URBANA,IL 61801","Stupp, SI (reprint author), UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,MAT RES LAB,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,1304 W GREEN ST,URBANA,IL 61801, USA.",,"Stupp, Samuel/B-6737-2009",,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE 05945],,,63,705,738,9,209,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,AUG 29,1997.0,277,5330,,,,,1242,1248,,10.1126/science.277.5330.1242,,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,XT827,WOS:A1997XT82700034,9271562.0,,,,2019-02-25

Due to their large geometrical aspect ratios, they are well suited for use as biomolecular templates for the fabrication of magnetic and electrically conductive nanowires. Three-dimensional metallization of these MTs is demonstrated by an electroless deposition technique of nickel initiated by molecular palladium catalysts. In this study of the deposition conditions, it is shown that in the use of electroless plating for the metallization of tubulin assemblies the process parameters, such as temperature and pH, need to be adjusted to the chemical conditions of the in-vitro self-assembly process of MTs. The activated and metallized MTs have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the distribution of the Pd catalyst particles after MT activation, we found that a minimum nickel thickness of about 10 nm is required to produce a continuous film.

At low compressive loads, the forces were repulsive, but they became attractive when the proteins were pressed into the polymer layer at higher loads, The adhesion was sufficiently robust that separation of the streptavidin and PEG uprooted anchored polymer from the supporting membrane. These interactions altered the properties of the grafted chains, After the onset of the attraction, the polymer continued to bind protein for several hours, The changes were not due to protein denaturation. These data demonstrate directly that the biological activity of PEG is not due solely to properties of simple polymers such as the excluded volume, It is also coupled to the competitive interactions between solvent and other materials such as proteins for the chain segments and to the ability of this material to adopt higher order intrachain structures.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801",,,,,,,,55,208,209,2,55,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The polyacrylamide has a high specific surface area, a relatively low content of water-soluble low-molecular-weight compounds and, owing to its non-ionogenic character, a pH-independent swelling degree. For the composite material consisting of the silicone rubber and very fine powdery cross-linked polyacrylamide, we have measured the rate of swelling in water, the mechanical properties (tensile strength, break elongation, hardness, resilience), biological properties (implantation test, cytotoxicity, cell cultivation) and UV absorption of its water extracts. The polyacrylamide and polysiloxane purity, as the composite material starting components, has been determined to be satisfactory. As a result, a high swelling rate of the prepared composite material has been observed, resulting in reaching more than 70% wt of water of the equilibrium swelling. The results show that the composite material is suitable for biological and medical use. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

To study the distribution of chromium in mice organs with time, several animals were subcutaneously injected with 2.70 x 10(-3) mol/L of chromium solution during a certain period of time. Square wave voltammetry using adsorptive collection of Cr3+-DTPA complex on a mercury film microelectrode (MFM) was used for quantitation. Optimized conditions included DTPA concentration of 2.0 x 10(-2) mol/L, sodium acetate 4.0 x 10(-2) mol/L, sodium nitrate 0.40 mol/L, potassium permanganate 1.0 x 10(-3) mol/L, pH ca. 6.1, deposition potential of -1.15 V, deposition time 20 s, frequency 100 Hz, step 2.5 mV and an amplitude of 20 mV. The detection limit of the method was 1.54 x 10(-8) mol/L after deposition of 20 s. Other species presented in the biological material such as calcium and iron do not interfere with the chromium determinations. The accuracy of the proposed method was checked by comparing the results with those obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) yielding good agreement. The results showed an increase of chromium levels with time in liver, kidney and spleen, indicating that this metal is partially accumulated in the studied organs.","UNIV AVEIRO, DEPT BIOL, P-3810 AVEIRO, PORTUGAL","Pereira, MC (reprint author), UNIV PORTO, DEPT ENGN QUIM, INST BIOMED ENGN, FAC ENGN, PRACA CORONEL PACHECO 1, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL.",,"Pereira, Maria/S-6624-2016","Pereira, Maria/0000-0001-8505-3432; Pereira, Maria de Lourdes/0000-0001-6703-7869; Sousa, Joao/0000-0002-8269-9390",,,,26,27,27,0,7,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1040-0397,,,ELECTROANAL,Electroanalysis,AUG,1997.0,9,12,,,,,941,944,,10.1002/elan.1140091215,,,,4,"Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry",Chemistry; Electrochemistry,YB188,WOS:A1997YB18800011,,,,,2019-02-25

This study evaluates metallic, ceramic, and bioabsorbable facial reconstruction materials for their differential effects on radiation dosimetry. Methods. Commercially pure titanium (cpt), stainless steel (steel), titanium alloy (tia), hydroxyapatite (HA), acid poly-L-lactide (PLA, a bioabsorbable polymer) were obtained for this study. The radiation doses distal (behind) and proximal (in front of) to the test material were measured with an ionization chamber placed at several distances from the test material. Therefore, transmission (proximal to plate) and backscattering (distal to plate) factors were generated at several distances for each material. Results. Poly-L-lactide transmitted nearly 100% of the incident radiation beam. The metals had the greatest effect on transmission with steel, followed by cpt, tia, and HA showing the greatest reduction of incident beam. Poly-L-lactide revealed minimal backscattering. Greater backscatter of the incident radiation beam was seen from steel, followed by cpt and HA, Poly-L-lactide also behaved similar to water in transmission and backscatters properties during electron irradiation. Conclusions. Poly-L-lactide has a minimal effect on the radiation-dose distribution and may be beneficial as a reconstructive device for patients undergoing head and neck cancer radiotherapy. Hydroxyapatite showed a relatively minor effect, whereas the metals (steel, followed by opt and tia) revealed the greatest detrimental effect on the radiation-dose distribution.

This phenomenon is potentially important to dental alloys which are adjacent to oral tissues. To help define the mechanisms by which Ni causes an infiltration of inflammatory cells, we exposed endothelial cells in vitro to Ni ions and measured the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 is known to be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells from the bloodstream. We also exposed macrophages to Ni ions to test the hypothesis that Ni might alter cytokine secretion and subsequently cause expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. The results showed that Ni ions could promote the expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells, but only at concentrations which were high enough (850 mu mol/L for 24 h) to suppress cell metabolic activity. Although we had previous evidence that Ni could cause macrophages to secrete cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta, Ni-exposed macrophage supernatants did not induce expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells at concentrations subtoxic to the macrophages (85 mu mol/L). At subtoxic concentrations, Ni ions were able to suppress ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells which were stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide. Thus, Ni ions either promoted or suppressed the expression of ICAM-1 depending on their concentration. This dual action of Ni ions may be important in vivo where a gradient of concentrations of released ions is Likely to exist around the implanted biomaterial. Further studies are necessary to determine the effect of time of exposure and the molecular mechanisms of increased ICAM-1 expression.

The dynamic compaction method recently was developed to consolidate drug-loaded calcium phosphate powder without a sintering step. Zn the present work, human recombinant growth hormone was loaded on biphasic calcium phosphate powder and consolidated by a specific process of cold sintering (dynamic compaction). Analyses of the biocompatibility of compacted pellets (mouse L929 fibroblastic cell culture) and the bioactivity of the drugs released by them (growth hormone bioassay) were performed. This report demonstrates the biocompatibility of the compacts prepared by dynamic compaction. L929 cell proliferation was maintained and the capacity to secrete fibronectin was conserved in the presence of compacted materials. Comparison of released growth hormone integrity, revealed by radioimmunoassay and eluted stain bioassay, has shown that the biological activity of growth hormone was totally preserved after dynamic compaction. However, 35% of loaded growth hormone was not released in our experimental conditions, probably because of the inaccessibility of growth hormone within the granulated compacts. Dynamic compaction shows good potential for the production of biomaterials capable of releasing therapeutic agents in situ.

Titanium alloy implants with and without a hydroxyapatite coating were used as positive and negative controls, and these were implanted with a circumferential gap of one millimeter in the spongious bone of the knee condyles of two groups of four goats. These goats were sacrificed at 6 and 25 weeks. A second experiment was done on two groups of four goats with the same type of titanium alloy and hydroxyapatite-coated implants as controls and with Polyactive(R) 55-45 coated titanium alloy implants for testing. These goats were sacrificed at 9 and 25 weeks, respectively. Qualitative and quantitative differences in gap healing were evaluated through light microscopy, and initiation and direction of bone apposition were determined with fluorescence microscopy. Apposition of bone was seen directly on all hydroxyapatite surfaces and on some of the noncoated titanium alloy surfaces. The difference between the percentage of bone growth on the titanium alloy implants and the hydroxyapatite-coated implants appeared to be divergent in time: the bone growth on the noncoated implants declined after 9 weeks in contrast to the steady increase of bone growth on the hydroxyapatite-coated implants towards the 25 week follow-up time (p = 0.02). No significant difference was found between the first and the second experiment: apposition of bone on the implants differed only 6.6% on a scale of 0% to 100%. Only scarce bone growth was seen on the polyactive-coated implants in this model. The newly tested Polyactive(R) 55-45 coating apparently needs initial bone contact for bone-bonding and therefore showed hardly any direct bone formation on its surface. The clear differences in the reaction of bone to the coated and noncoated implants in this goat study and the reproducibility of these reactions of bone to the different controls indicate the sensitivity of the currently used animal model and its suitability for use as a bioactivity assay.

Regeneration of bone in contact with all implants was found three months after implantation. The shear strength between CFRC implants and bone was lower than with the HA implants and higher than the shear strength between the surgical steel and bone. Compressive strength of CFRC implants removed after the observation period was significantly lower than the compressive strength of non-implanted samples.

The biocompatibility and the biodegradability of the polymers were confirmed by subcutaneous implantation of polymer foils in rats. The newly developed polymers, two polyesters (DegraPol/bsc43 and DegraPol/bsd43) and a polyesterether (DegraPol/bst41), were found to exhibit good cell compatibility; the cell-to-substrate interactions induced neither cytotoxic effects nor activation of macrophages. The adhesion and growth of fibroblasts and macrophages were different among the substrate. Fibroblasts adhered on the polyesters to about 60% of control cell cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and proliferated in the same doubling time as on TCPS. On the polyetherester cells exhibited weak adhesion; however, they proliferated up to day 4 after plating at the same doubling time as on TCPS (of about 42 h), and then decreased their doubling time to 27 h. Macrophages attached to the polyesters to about 40-60% of TCPS but no significant change was seen in the doubling time of cells cultured on TCPS and the polyesters. Again on the polyetherester, macrophages exhibited relatively low adhesion (25% of TCPS) and high doubling time (about 100 h). Fibroblasts produced high amounts (up to 500% of control cells) of collagen type I and type IV, and fibronectin. Macrophages responded to lipopolysaccharide treatment by the production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), indicating that the cell-to-polymer interactions allow fibroblasts and macrophages to maintain their phenotype. All three test polymers exhibit favourable tissue compatibility. The formed capsule was just a few cell layers thick (< 30 mu m). After 2 months implanted subcutaneously in rats, the molecular weight of the test polymers was reduced by > 20% depending on their chemical structure. Taken collectively, the present data demonstrate that the newly developed multiblock copolyesters are biocompatible and biodegradable.","UNIV ZURICH HOSP, DEPT SURG, DIV RES, CH-8091 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND","Saad, B (reprint author), ETH ZURICH, INST POLYMERS, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.",,"Suter, Ulrich/H-8900-2013","Suter, Ulrich/0000-0001-7467-7346; Saad, Bashar/0000-0003-4052-2279",,,,24,32,32,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Osteogenic properties, and increased biomechanical properties, could be induced by combining them with human bone-forming cell populations. Progress has been hampered both by the lack of a suitable experimental assay of in vivo human bone formation and a suitable in vivo test system with wh ich to study such cells in association with biomaterials. Here, trabecular bone-derived cells and marrow stromal fibroblastic cells from four human donors aged between 14 and 27 y have been cultured in vitro then combined with a porous ceramic within diffusion chambers and implanted into athymic mice. Bone and cartilage formation was found within the chambers primed with cells cultured in the continuous presence of dexamethasone and ascorbate. These tissues were found in close apposition to the ceramic, confirming that the material is biocompatible and bioactive. These findings demonstrate both that appropriately primed human-cell populations can express the fully differentiated osteoblastic phenotype in the diffusion-chamber model, and also that this is a useful system in which to test the interactions of such cell populations with putative biomaterials.","UNIV OXFORD, NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, MRC, BONE RES LAB, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD, NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,43,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Bacterial adherence to biomaterial surfaces is an important step in the pathogenesis of prosthetic infection. The exact mechanism of prosthetic infection remains unclear. It is thought that certain bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, after adhering to biomaterial surfaces, secrete a layer polysaccharide, an extracellular substance (slime) and then form a biofilm (a biomass of bacteria and slime). The biofilm makes the embedded bacteria less accessible to the human defense system and significantly decreases antibiotic susceptibility. Before effective preventive or therapeutic measures can be achieved, the process, characteristics, or mechanism of bacterial adhesion to biomaterials have to be studied. In this review, the in-vitro experimental methods for bacterial adhesion will be discussed, which concentrates on (1) how to design a new in-vitro model of bacterial adhesion or biofilm formation, including the selection of bacteria, sample surface preparation, conducting bacterial adhesion or biofilm formation experiments, and the sample preparation for evaluation; and (2) methods for examining adhered bacteria and biofilm, which include microscopy for counting and morphological observation of adhered bacteria, viable bacterial counting methods, other direct or indirect bacterial counting methods, and the methods for evaluating biofilm.

Porcine small-intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a biomaterial which has been investigated for several applications including arterial and venous grafts and repair of tendon, ligament, body wall, and urinary bladder defects. The calcification potential of peracetic acid (PAA)-sterilized SIS was studied. Four test samples, (1) native (cleaned, untreated) SIS, (2) SIS sterilized with 0.1% PAA, (3) SIS treated with 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 20 min, and (4) commercially available glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine bioprosthetic heart valve cusp segments (GPV), were each implanted subcutaneously in each of 24 weanling rats. Six rats were euthanatized at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Evaluation of calcium concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopy and extent of mineralization and fibrosis by light microscopy were performed. Atomic absorption revealed no calcification in native or peracetic acid-treated SIS at any time point compared with preimplant calcium concentration. Statistically significant (P<0.0001) calcification occurred in glutaraldehyde-treated materials (SIS and GPV) at each evaluation as compared to native and peracetic acid-treated samples. Histopathology indicated native and peracetic acid-treated SIS showed no implant mineralization (P<0.0001) and little peri-implant fibrosis (P<0.0001). Results suggested that native and peracetic acid-treated SIS have a low calcification potential and further study of this biomaterial is warranted.

Irradiation was performed with swift heavy ions (E > 1 MeV/amu) and the grafting of styrene was achieved by the peroxide method. A characterisation of surface topography was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-rays (EDXA). Compared to the SEM micrograph of PVDF, the SEM micrographs of the polystyrene grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-PS) and the functionalised polystyrene grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-PSf) show circular ''islands'' of different sizes. EDXA analysis shows that the amount of fluorine is directly dependent on the presence of these islands. When the styrene is grafted, the amount of fluorine is lower. The swift heavy ions induce significant grafting only in small regions (the latent tracks) of the polymer. Fibrinogen and albumin adsorption from plasma on these materials was quantitatively assessed using I-125-labelled proteins prepared under a quality controlled procedure. The amount of adsorbed proteins is greater in the case of PVDF-g-PSf. For PVDF-g-PSf the rates of exchanged proteins increases when the functionalisation yield increases. The distribution of bound proteins, determined by microautoradiography seems to be homogeneous on the three different materials studied here.

Using shear controlled orientation in injection moulding (Scorim) it was possible to induce anisotropy into the mouldings and to simultaneously enhance stiffness and ductility. Degradation was studied in simulated physiological solutions (Hank's balanced salt solution) with and without added bovine serum. Both the dry weight loss and the changes in mechanical properties were determined for ageing periods up to 80 days. The degradation behaviour proved to be strongly dependent on the formulation of the material studied, and on the addition of proteins. The susceptibility of the starch/EVOH blends to degradation when sterilised with ethylene oxide (EtO) was also studied, and showed that the polymers could stand one EtO sterilisation cycle. However, two consecutive cycles severely degraded the polymer structure and properties.","INST BIOMED ENGN, INEB, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO, DEPT POLYMER ENGN, P-4800 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL; BRUNEL UNIV, WOLFSON CTR MAT PROC, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND","Reis, RL (reprint author), UNIV PORTO, FEUP, DEPT MET ENGN, RUA BRAGOS, P-4099 OPORTO, PORTUGAL.",,"Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012; Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008","Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Cunha M., Antonio/0000-0003-3860-7732",,,,18,93,95,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

The cause of aseptic loosening of prosthetic joint replacement components is unclear. Early experience with total joint arthroplasty was plagued by a number of problems that no longer exist as major impediments to long-term success, Improvements in the operating room environment and the use of prophylactic antibiotics have substantially reduced the high incidence of infection to less than 1%, Implant materials have long been considered biologically inert, but recent studies indicate that inflammatory reactions directed against the implanted materials may contribute to aseptic loosening. Currently, particulate debris from cement or polyethylene causing loosening of the prosthesis is the major problem in total joint arthroplasty. Significant data suggest a progression from a simple inflammatory reaction to complex immune responses against the biomaterials. The cellular responses to particles of polymethylmethacrylate, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, and alloys of cobalt-chromium and titanium have been assayed in vitro in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and avascular necrosis who had total joint replacement, Elevated immunologic cell proliferation responses to both acrylic and cobalt chromium were observed in patients with aseptically loosened prostheses, These findings suggest that the development of a cellular response to particulate debris may be significant in the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening.

The effects of discharge voltage (200-500 V) on Ti-O film formation were investigated. The Ti-O films deposited under various discharge voltages appeared to be uniform and adhesive. while their color tone and Luster varied with the voltage. The films obtained under a voltage higher than 250 V were hard and durable. and the ones obtained under a voltage higher than 280 V were compact with less defects. The Ti/O ratio of each film was nearly constant in depth direction and its oxygen concentration depended on the voltage, which was detected by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), On the basis of X-lay diffractometry (XRD), it was concluded that the suboxides such as Ti4O7 and Ti6O11 were formed in the films and that Ti2O was also formed under a voltage higher than 400 V. The hardness of the films increased with the increase in voltage of up to 400 V. but slightly decreased at a higher voltage range. The maximum hardness higher than Hv2000 was noteworthy.

The pH of the liquid extract was adjusted to 5. Organotins were ethylated with sodium tetraethylborate, extracted in isooctane and determined by means of a microwave-induced plasma atomic emission detector coupled to a gas chromatograph. The stability of butyl and phenyl compounds, exposed to the microwave energy, was studied as a function of the vessel temperature. The possibility of simultaneous carried-out extractions and the use of microwave to perform the ethylation and extraction of organotin compounds was also studied. The full procedure was validated with certified material NIES-11 and with real samples, by comparison with a classic leaching method using tetramethylammonium hydroxide without microwave.","UNIV SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,FAC QUIM,DEPT QUIM ANALIT NUTR & BROMATOL,E-15706 SANTIAGO COMPOSTE,SPAIN",,,"Rodriguez Pereiro, Isaac/H-4771-2015; Cela, Rafael/G-3358-2013","Rodriguez Pereiro, Isaac/0000-0002-9693-2042; Cela, Rafael/0000-0003-3076-5007; Mejuto, Carmen/0000-0001-9347-8000",,,,31,27,29,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0021-9673,,,J CHROMATOGR A,J.

Stringent requirements have been defined for construction materials. They must be light, yet sufficiently hard and rigid, and able to be machined with high precision. The friction coefficient must be low and the wear resistance high. The materials must be chemically inert and not deformable. Also, the materials must be biocompatible, and the blood contacting surface must be hemocompatible. We assessed the materials in terms of physiochemistry, mechanics, and tribology to select the best for hemocompatibility (determined by studies of protein adsorption; platelet, leukocyte, and red cell retention; and hemolysis, among other measurements) and biocompatibility (determined by measurement of complement activation and toxicity, among other criteria). Of the materials tested, for short- and middle-term assistance, we chose titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and alumina ceramic (Al2O3) and for long-term and permanent use, composite materials (TIN coating on graphite). We saw that the polishing process of the substrate must be improved.

In this report, we show the effect of the chemical structure of a synthetic polymer support on monocyte adhesion and selected phenotypic characteristics in vitro as a model for the initial steps of non-self-recognition of an implant. The extent of monocyte adhesion was significantly influenced by the support chemistry. The highest level of monocyte adhesion was observed on a surface copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate relative to results of experiments in which poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) or the copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with the sodium salt of methacrylic acid was used. Cell adhesion to the polymers tested and to glass was accompanied by enhanced expression of the carbohydrate-binding sites tested for asialoglycoprotein beta-galactosides such as galectins, beta-N-acetylgalactosamine, alpha-mannoside, specific lectin for heparin as well as the lymphokine-macrophage migration inhibitory factor in the monocytes tested. These results suggest the importance of monocyte adhesion to the biomaterial surface for their development into macrophages and further non-self-recognition of the implanted device.

We found that IgG-coated surfaces induced a substantial and prolonged neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). When a hydrophilic surface was used to support protein binding, a somewhat lower neutrophil response (around 35%) was obtained, compared with the response induced by IgG on a hydrophobic surface. The production of ROS was completely eliminated when cytochalasin B was added to the measuring system, suggesting the involvement of the cell cytoskeleton in the activation process. The relation between the intra- and extracellular generation of ROS was further assessed, and we found that most of the ROS produced were released from the cells, in agreement with a model in which the activating surfaces induce a 'frustrated' phagocytic response.

The other materials released all of the 'bound' bFGF with two hours or produced an inflammatory response in vivo. Therefore, the lens tissue had the most potential for controlled long-term delivery of bFGF in vivo.

The polymers were prepared by chain extension with diisocyanates of PHB/HV-diol and either PCL-diol or Diorez, another aliphatic polyester-diol. Regardless of the chemical composition of the four tested polyesterurethanes used as substrates, no morphological difference was observed either in the macrophages (macrophage cell Line J774) or in the fibroblasts (fibroblast cell line 3T3) cultured on these polymers. In contrast, however, cell adhesion and growth of macrophages and fibroblasts were affected by the polymer properties. Compared to macrophages cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), cells cultured on the test polymers exhibited levels of cell adhesion that varied from 65-100% of TCPS, and the doubling time was 25-43% higher on the polymers than on TCPS. Likewise, fibroblasts adhered to the polymers at lower rates (50-85% of TCPS) and grew at higher doubling times (125-140% of TCPS). Furthermore, cells cultured on the test polymers preserved their phenotypes: fibroblasts produced high amounts (up to 280% of control cells) of collagens Type I and Type IV and fibronectin; and macrophages produced nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the same concentrations as control cells and responded to lipopolysaccharide treatment by the elevation of the production of NO and TNF-alpha, indicating that the cell-to-polymer interactions allow fibroblasts and macrophages to maintain their phenotypes. In vivo investigations showed that all four test polymers exhibit favorable tissue compatibility. The formed capsule was 60-250 mu m thick. Ln addition, the polymers are degradable. After one year's subcutaneous implantation in rats, the molecular weight of the test polymers were reduced to about 50%, depending on the composition. Taken collectively, the present data demonstrate that the newly developed polyesterurethanes are cell and tissue compatible and biodegradable.

It is found that in both outer and inner surfaces of bamboo culm, there exists-some silica. Bamboo elicits an inert response when soaked directly in calcification solution. After the rind of bamboo is treated with sodium hydroxide solution, the silica underneath can induce precipitation of calcium phosphate in an ambient environment. Furthermore, by subsequent grafting with polyethylene glycol (PEG 1000), calcium phosphate induction of bamboo rind can be improved,depending on the concentration of NaOH solution and treatment time. Heat treatment of bamboo can remove the organic materials around the minerals in bamboo, allowing the calcification behaviour of the silica-containing inorganic phase of bamboo in aqueous solution to be studied.","ACAD SINICA,INST MET RES,SHENYANG 110015,PEOPLES R CHINA","Li, SH (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV,BIOMAT RES GRP,PROF BRONKHORSTLAAN 10,NL-3723 MB BILTHOVEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,9,9,9,1,4,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Therefore, hydroxyapatite ceramics are used as coating materials. During or after the coating process, cracking and tearing often occur in the coating layer of the implant. These defects are caused by the residual stress in the vicinity of the coating interface. It is important to evaluate the residual stress in this region. The purpose of work is to present a method for measuring simultaneously and nondestructively three-dimensional distribution of residual stress in both the hydroxyapatite coating layer and the titanium substrate, using polychromatic X-rays.

A significant proportion of the reactivity of antibodies to crude slime was also shown to be attributed to the 20-kDa polysaccharide, This polysaccharide is immunogenic in humans since blood sera derived from patients 10-15 days after confirmation of slime-producing S. epidermidis bacteremia gave approximately 16 times higher reactivity than that of healthy individuals, Antibodies to 20-kDa polysaccharide were able to recognize and react specifically with slime-positive S. epidermidis strains compared to slime-negative ones (2 to 5 times higher reactivity), Moreover, these antibodies exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences in the degree of reactivity among S. epidermidis and other staphylococci species.

In this study, the characteristics of heparinized Cuprophan membranes have been evaluated. After immobilization, heparin partially retained its biologic activity. An anticoagulant activity of 12.4 +/- 4.2 mU/cm(2) was measured using a thrombin inactivation assay. Immobilized heparin also displayed an anti-complement activity. After contact with human serum, heparinized Cuprophan induced no generation of significant amounts of fluid phase terminal complement complex (TCC), whereas untreated Cuprophan induced the generation of substantial amounts of TCC. Heparinization did not affect the permeability of Cuprophan for model solutes with molecular weights up to 12,000 g/mol except for sulfobromophthalein sodium salt. The permeability of Cuprophan for sulfobromophthalein sodium salt was slightly decreased after heparinization. The ultrafiltration rate of Cuprophan increased by about 30% after heparinization, probably owing to an increased swelling of the membrane in water. Heparinized Cuprophan incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C showed some release of heparin. These amounts of released heparin, however, were very low as compared to the amounts of heparin which are systemically administered during clinical hemodialysis treatment. It is concluded that Cuprophan membranes heparinized by means of the CDI-activation procedure are highly promising for application in hemodialyzers to be used for the treatment of patients with reduced or without systemic administration of heparin.

Biodegradable materials further provide the significant advantage that the polymer will disappear in vivo, obviating long-term negative tissue responses as well as the need for retrieval. In earlier studies we synthesized and characterized arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide-modified poly(lactic acid-co-lysine) (PLAL). In this study, both bulk properties and surface features have been characterized, with a focus on surface analysis as a means of interpreting observed changes in cell behavior. Bulk peptide attachments were performed using 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). Amino groups were measured using colorimetric assays and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Peptides were measured by incorporating iodine into the peptide as a distinct elemental marker for use with XPS. Typical samples contained 13 +/- 4 pmol/cm(2) of amino groups and 4 +/- 0.2 pmol/ cm(2) of peptides, as calculated from XPS measurements of nitrogen and iodine. The wettability and crystallinity of the samples were determined by contact angles and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively Wettability and crystallinity were not altered by the incorporation of lysine or peptides. After incubating bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells for 4 h on surfaces with RGD-containing peptides, the mean spread cell area increased from 77 +/- 2 mu m(2) to 405 +/- 29 mu m(2) compared to 116 +/- 11 mu m(2) an poly(lactic acid), 87 +/- 4 mu m(2) on PLAL, and 105 +/- 4 mu m(2) on surfaces with RDG-containing (control) peptides. The significance of this work is that the first synthetic interactive, resorbable biomaterial has been developed, and use of this material to control cell behavior has been demonstrated.

Several in vitro studies using rat or mouse clonal cell lines have shown that rhBMP-2 may be involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts from osteoblast precursor cells or stromal cells in the bone marrow. However, there is little information available about the effects of rhBMP-2 on cultured human bone marrow cells. We investigated the effects of rhBMP-2 cultured on human bone marrow cells and osteoblastic cells on various biomaterials. Human bone cells were divided into fresh bone marrow cells, fibroblast colony-forming units (cfu-F, stromal precursors), and osteoblastic cells. The cells were cultured with or without rhBMP-2 on various biomaterials, including titanium alloy, pure titanium, cobalt alloy, and hydroxyapatite. It was found that rhBMP-2 (500 ng/mL) significantly stimulated alkaline phosphatase production by fresh bone marrow cells and cfu-F. However, when cultured on titanium alloy or pure titanium, only fresh bone marrow cells showed an increase of alkaline phosphatase production after rhBMP-2 stimulation. Production of osteocalcin, a marker of mature osteoblasts, was not stimulated by rhBMP-2 in any combinations tested. These findings suggest that rhBMP-2 may be involved in inducing the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells into osteoblastic cells rather than stimulating further differentiation of osteoblastic cells into mature osteoblasts. In addition, grafts of fresh human bone marrow cells of cfu-F stimulated by rhBMP-2 may have the potential to promote bone formation at sites of nonunion as well as around titanium joint prostheses.

However, the demand for more bioresistant and biocompatible polyurethanes to meet the needs of long-term implant devices still remains an important issue. Since most biological interactions with materials occur at the interface, a significant number of studies for improving the biocompatibility of polyurethanes have concentrated on surface modification. It is well known that additives used in polymeric materials as processing aids, mold releasing agents, antioxidants, etc., migrate to the surface and change the surface properties of the material. Under certain conditions polymeric additives may also migrate toward surfaces. This study describes two fluorine-containing, surface-modifying macromolecules (SMMs) that have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit polyurethane degradation. These materials actively migrate to the upper surface of a material film when they are mixed with a base polymeric material. Contact angle measurements for the mixture of SMM with base polyurethane indicate that the surface becomes more hydrophobic after adding the SMMs, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows an enrichment of fluorine on the polymer surfaces. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms indicate that the microstructure, as defined by the thermal transitions of the base polymer, are not altered by the addition of SMMs. Enzyme-induced biodegradation tests exhibit a significant reduction of polyurethane degradation in the presence of these surface-resident materials. The results indicate that the SMMs have the potential to resist hydrolytic degradation mediated by lysosomal enzymes while generating a surface chemistry on the native elastomer which is similar in nature to that of a fluoropolymer, e.g., Teflon.(R) (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","UNIV TORONTO,FAC DENT,DEPT BIOMAT,TORONTO,ON M5G 1G6,CANADA; UNIV OTTAWA,INST HEART,CARDIOVASC DEVICES DIV,OTTAWA,ON,CANADA; UNIV OTTAWA,DEPT CHEM ENGN,OTTAWA,ON,CANADA",,,,,,,,41,53,55,1,23,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The gap-junctional intercellular communication of test cells was inhibited on the PE film, but this inhibitory activity was markedly decreased when the surface of the PE film was immobilized with collagen. These results suggest that the in vivo tumor promotion activity of the untreated PE may be stronger than that of collagen-immobilized PE. On the other hand, surface modification with RGDS peptide, which is well known as the sequence of cell attachment domain in extracellular matrix proteins, did not reduce the promotion activity of PE film. In addition, neither modification with bovine serum albumin nor RGES peptide reduced the activity of PE film. These findings suggest that reduction of the inhibitory activity on gap-junctional intercellular communication by collagen immobilization is not simply due to improved cell adherence via the RGDS sequence but to some cell-cell recognition via collagen molecules essential for the gap-junctional intercellular communication.

The surface tension of the liquids is measured as a function of time by the pendant drop method and the surface tension of the solids is determined from the experimental contact angles of water and diiodomethane, using the geometric mean, the harmonic mean and the equation of state approaches. These values together with the contact angles measured before [A.P. Serro et al., Biomaterials, submitted] are used in the Young equation to obtain the solid/liquid interfacial tension. The liquid samples are Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with a composition similar to the blood plasma and solutions of bovine serum albumin(BSA) in HBSS. The solid substrates are titanium samples of three types: oxidized by exposure to air (type 0), pre-incubated in HBSS (type 1) and pre-incubated in HBSS+BSA solutions (type 2). For all the substrates the solid/liquid interfacial tension involving the protein solution is higher than the equivalent value obtained with the solvent which should be related to the hydrophilicity of these substrates. The decrease of gamma(SL) with time for the substrate of type 2 may be explained by protein desorption.

The model incorporates the mechanical energy in calcified tissue due to time-varying loads into the more commonly used energetic arguments for mineralization BY using the Voight (equal-strain) and Reuss (equal-stress) composite material models to relate the volumetric density of calcified tissue to overall material modules, two models were developed to assess the effect of an imposed overall material strain on mineralization. A rate equation based on strain energy was used to model the kinetics of mineralization, and the stability of the rate equation was assessed, leading to a limit on overall material strain based on the specific energy for mineralization of soft tissues The result depended on the stiffness of the material in series with the mineralizing tissue. Taking the stiffness of the material in series with the tissue as infinite lead to a prediction of critical strain for mineralization in the calcifying biological tissue which was the same on the Reuss and Voight models. The interaction of this theoretical model with biological factors and some clinical implications Of the model are discussed.

Sterilised sacks were filled with heparinised blood, rotated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and sequential samples collected into 0.103 M sodium citrate. Thrombin generation measured by thrombin-antithrombin III complexes showed a difference between the polymers at 3 h through to 6 h (P < 0.05), C94 showing the least activation and C34 the most. Factor XIIa and D-dimer levels increased between 12 (P(0.05) and 24 h (P < 0.01) for all polyetherurethanes. The ratio of soft:hard segments (which determine hydrophobicity) of the polyetherurethanes showed a direct relationship with the degree of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. There was no significant increase in monocyte tissue factor expression at 5 and 105 min. Platelet function as measured by whole blood platelet aggregation showed a reduction with pellethane and C94 after Ih using collagen, with no changes for C34.

How to control, reduce, or eliminate the ice formation has been an important research topic in fundamental cryobiology. The objective of this study was to test a hypothesis that the coupled interaction of microwave radiation and cryoprotectant concentration could significantly influence ice formation and enhance potential vitrification in cryopreservation media at a relative slow cooling rate. Test samples consisted of a series of solutions with ethylene glycol (a cryoprotectant) concentration ranging from 3 to 5.5 M. A specific microwave resonant cavity was built and utilized to provide an intense oscillating electric field. Solutions were simultaneously exposed to this electric field and cooled to -196 degrees C by rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen. Control samples were similarly submerged in liquid nitrogen but without the microwave field. The amount of ice formation was determined by analysis of digital images of the samples. The morphology of the solidified samples was observed by cryomicroscopy. It was found that ice formation was greatly influenced by microwave irradiation. For example, ice formation could be reduced by roughly 56% in 3.5 M ethylene glycol solutions. An average reduction of 66% was observed in 4.5 M solutions. Statistical analysis indicated that the main effects of microwave and ethylene glycol concentration as well as the interaction between these two factors significantly (P < 0.01) influenced ice formation amount, confirming the hypothesis. This preliminary study suggests that a combined use of microwave irradiation and cryoprotectant might be a potential approach to control ice formation in cells/tissues during the cooling process and to enhance vitrification of these biomaterials for long-term cryopreservation.

The mRNA probe was labeled by digoxigenin; the antisense was used for detection, and the sense was used as control. Macrophage cells were incubated with MAA and HEMA for 72 hours in a 96-well microplate, The negative control was macrophage cells without test materials and the positive control was lipopolysaccharide (LPS), After cell fixation and RNA denaturation, the cells were prehybridized with tRNA followed by the addition of the mRNA probe. After post-hybridization washes, antidigoxigenin antibody, and biotin-avidin-alkaline phosphatase were used for microscopic visualization of a purple precipitate that is confirmatory of TNF-alpha mRNA production, Using this test system, MAA and HEMA were both positive for TNF-alpha mRNA production, This result agreed with earlier tests demonstrating potential utility of the probe method for biomaterial cytokine induction studies.",,,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538",0888-319X,,,IN VITRO TOXICOL,In Vitro Toxicol.,SUM,1997.0,10,2,,,,,245,251,,,,,,7,Toxicology,Toxicology,XT134,WOS:A1997XT13400009,,,,,2019-02-25

The coated HAP layer was tightly attached to the surface of the titanium plate, at least at the level of scanning electron microscopy, Interestingly, the HAP particles stuck together at room temperature as if they were sintered, The coating was stable against ultrasonication in water for at least 5 min, and it was difficult to remove by nail scratching, Thus, the bonding strength between the HAP powder and the titanium plate was much higher than that achieved with currently employed room temperature coating processes such as dipping, electrophoretic deposition, and electrochemical deposition, Therefore, the blast coating method is potentially valuable for the fabrication of useful biomaterials for hard tissue replacement.

However, the cement is not without its drawbacks. The main one is the role that it has been postulated to play in the aseptic loosening and, hence, clinical life of the arthroplasty. In turn, this role is directly related to the mechanical properties of the cement, especially the resistance to fracture of the cement in the mantle at the cement-prosthesis interface or the cement-bone interface. The present work is a detailed critical review of the recent literature on the properties of bone cement that are considered germane to its use in the stated application, The relevant properties are identified and a case is made for including each of them, Compilations of the values of these properties, obtained under clearly identified conditions, are presented for the six commercial formulations of bone cement in current popular orthopedic use. The gaps and unresolved questions in the current data base, efforts that should be made to address these issues, and research directions are covered.

Exposure of isotactic polypropylene to ozone resulted in surface oxidation, as detected by ESCA, and the formation of peroxides and hydroperoxides. The amount of oxygen-bearing moieties, as detected by FT-IR, was increased when a microporous membrane with a large surface area was used. Ozonation for an extended period of time, 1-2 h, resulted in a degradation of microporous PP, observed with SEM as an enlargement of pores and brittle characteristics of the material. The molecular weight of PP was dramatically reduced after as little as 5 min of ozonation. Exposure to ozone for longer periods of time contributed to further reductions of the molecular weight and gradual modification of chemical composition of polypropylene, restricted, however, to the surface or intercrystalline amorphous regions. It was possible to graft 2-hydroxyethylemthacrylate (HEMA) to the ozonated samples, such that the graft copolymer acted as continiuous matrix consequently linked to and reinforced by the PP crystals.

The family of patents formed the basis for several promising innovative biomaterials devices. However, only one commercial product has been realized. That product is the very successfull coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) now widely used in orthopaedic surgery, oral and maxillofacial bone repair and plastic surgery. This paper challenges the equation of discovery with a genuine innovation which reaches the marketplace. The paper reviews several aspects of the innovation and development history with an emphasis on the challenges of bringing any new biomaterial through all the conceptual, developmental, business and regulatory hurdles. New class three medical devices require huge investments of time and money typically requiring a minimum of eight years and 15-20 million dollars per new device to take it from concept to an approved product. These hurdles are so high that most research innovations in biomaterials never get put into the developmental pipeline. This paper is presented from an anecdotal perspective of an innovator who has had a continuous research and development involvement in the technology but has no significant management involvement beyond the early startup activities. It differs from predecessors is that it deals not only with the initial step of discovery but in the very difficult steps that follow on the road to a real innovation. Several strategies that may help other R&D groups outside the biomedical industry shorten the development cycle and increase the probability that a given biomaterials innovation can be seen through to approved product are discussed. Guidelines are suggested for culling out ideas that are technically sound but that likely won't lead to successful products.",,"White, EW (reprint author), RD 1 Box 182, Rossiter, PA 15772 USA.",,,,,,,19,6,6,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1432-8917,,,MATER RES INNOV,Mater.

The mechanism of integration of such material usually is evaluated by histologic analysis. The trace elements present in bone can be detected in the ceramic and help to provide a semiquantitative evaluation of osseointegration. Two different methods of microanalysis, energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and proton induced x-emission (PIXE) were used in this study to determine the appearance of trace elements (Zn, Sr, and Fe) present in bone at the implantation site containing the ceramic. Porous HA-ceramic cylinders were implanted in the cortical bone of sheep femurs for periods ranging from 2 to 36 weeks. Thick sections of the implant-containing bone were made at the end of the implantation period. A scanning line with proton or electron impacts 0.5 mm apart was plotted from the edges of the cortical bone across the implanted ceramic and the resulting x-ray spectra were determined. Following EDS analysis, the sections were surface-stained, observed under a light microscope, and the pore volume occupied by bone tissue was measured. The spectra obtained by PIXE method showed two regions for each element characterising either the bone tissue or the ceramic. Zinc and strontium present in the bone tissue, but absent from the ceramic, appeared 8 and 12 weeks after implantation, respectively. The concentration of iron present in the implant decreased with time. EDS showed no significant level of either element in the bone or the ceramic. Histologic observation revealed that immature bone invaded the pores of the outer layer of the ceramic as early as 2 weeks after implantation. The ceramics were totally osseointegrated 20 weeks after implantation, although ceramic degradation continued for longer. In this experiment, the PIXE method was apparently sufficiently sensitive for monitoring the amount of trace element appearing in bone-implanted material.","UNIV TOULOUSE 3, LAB TISSU OSSEUX & PATHOL OSTEOARTICULAIRES, F-31062 TOULOUSE, FRANCE; UNIV CLERMONT FERRAND, PHYS PARTICULES LAB, CLERMONT FERRAND, FRANCE; FAC SCI, INST PHYS NUCL EXPT, LIEGE, BELGIUM","Frayssinet, P (reprint author), BIOLAND, 132 RTE ESPAGNE, F-31100 TOULOUSE, FRANCE.",,,,,,,17,9,9,1,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0161-0457,1932-8745,,SCANNING,Scanning,JUN,1997.0,19,4,,,,,253,257,,,,,,5,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,XF007,WOS:A1997XF00700002,9195748.0,,,,2019-02-25

Precut segments of full silicone, silver-coated and hydrogel-coated ureteric stents were incubated with two uropathogenic bacterial strains with and without previous immersion in antibiotic solution. Tobramycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin solutions were used, as these antibiotics are commonly administered for the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). Microbiological analysis showed that immersion of ureteric stents in ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin yielded a significant reduction of bacterial adhesion, whereas immersion in tobramycin did not. The surface material of the stents had no direct influence on bacterial adhesion. In this experimental study, neither the silver nor the hydrogel coat reduced bacterial adhesion onto ureteric stents whereas immersion in a suitable antibiotic solution significantly reduced and even prevented this phenomenon, probably due to the adhesion of the antibiotic onto the stent surface. Prevention of bacterial adhesion onto ureteric stents is essential to reduce the risk of UTI in connection with these devices.","UNIV HELSINKI,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; UNIV BARI,SCH MED,CHAIR UROL R,BARI,ITALY",,,,,,,,18,13,13,0,3,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0300-5623,,,UROL RES,Urol.

The SEC film can be used as an inert, stable and hydrophobic electrode in aqueous solution over a wide potential range. In this study, the physical and the potential-assisted adsorption of various proteins on the SEC film is described. Because of the hydrophobic surface characteristic proteins easily adsorb and retain on the film surface by strong hydrophobic interactions. The amount of the adsorbed protein varies from 2.2 to 4.8 mu g cm(-2) depending on the protein when the film is incubated for 22 h in the protein solution. The adsorption is effectively accelerated and enhanced by applying a positive potential in the range from 0.4 V to 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The potential-assisted adsorption process is completed by 10-15 min and the amount of the adsorbed protein is nearly doubled as compared to the adsorption without potential. The adsorbed protein is chemically very stable in comparison with the protein in solution. More than 85% of the initial adsorbed proteins retains on the surface after three weeks of incubation in buffer solution. The initial adsorption rate is studied by quartz crystal micro-balance measurements on a thin polymer film coated quartz crystal. In addition, the SEC film surface is etched with air plasma which leads to a four-fold increase of the adsorption of proteins.

Following growth in human urine, the cell surface,hydrophobicity and zeta potential of two ureteral stent biofilm isolates, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, were significantly altered. In addition, the adherence of human urine-grown Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli to polyurethane was significantly increased by up to 52.1% and 58.6%, respectively. Treatment of the polyurethane with human urine rendered the polymer surface more hydrophilic (mean advancing water contact angle reduced from 97.59 degrees to 26.37 degrees). However, organisms grown in human urine showed less adherence (up to 90.4%) to the treated polymer than those grown in Mueller-Hinton broth. The results presented in this study indicate that in vivo conditions should be simulated as far as possible when carrying out in vitro bacterial adherence assays, especially if assessing novel methods for reduction of adherence.

Colonisation of a biomaterial surface with urea-splitting bacteria also causes alkalinisation of the urine with subsequent formation of encrusting deposits of struvite and hydroxyapatite. This study examined the role of both bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and biomaterial hydrophobicity in urinary device infection and encrustation. The polymers formed and investigated were poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and copolymers of PMMA with PHEMA (75:25, 50:50 and 25:75 w/w, respectively). Polymer surfaces were characterised by dynamic contact angle measurement in water. Polymer encrustation and adhesion of a hydrophilic Escherichia coli urinary isolate and a hydrophobic Enterococcus faecalis urinary isolate were also determined. The hydrophobic PMMA polymer was more effective in resisting encrustation than all of the more hydrophilic PMMA/PHEMA copolymer series. Adhesion of the hydrophilic Escherichia coli isolate to the copolymers increased with decreasing copolymer hydrophobicity. A relationship was not apparent between copolymer hydrophobicity and adherence of the hydrophobic Enterococcus faecalis isolate.

Persantin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation and is widely used as a vasodilator. Conjugate 1 consists of triply protected dipyridamole [three of the four hydroxyl groups carry a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) protective group) and the photoreactive 4-azidobenzoyl group. A short hydrophilic spacer chain, derived from triethylene glycol, separates the protected dipyridamole system and the photoreactive group. Compound 1 was immobilized on polyurethane sheets (Pellethane D-55) through irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light, and the protective groups were removed afterward. The resulting modified polyurethane surfaces were characterized by different physicochemical techniques: UV extinction, contact angle measurements (captive bubble technique), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The UV extinction measurements showed the presence of 13 +/- 1 nmol of immobilized dipyridamole/cm(2). The contact angle measurements revealed that the modified surface was markedly more hydrophilic than the control (i.e. unmodified polyurethane). XPS measurements clearly established the presence of immobilized dipyridamole in the outermost layers of the modified surface. This was especially clear from the XPS spectra recorded at a low take-off angle (similar to 6 degrees). Furthermore, the XPS spectra showed that the TBDMS protective groups had been quantitatively removed during the deprotection/washing treatment. The in vitro blood compatibility of the modified surface was studied with the thrombin generation assay as developed in our group, as well as with scanning electron microscopy. The thrombin generation test produced a lag time of 1275 s for the modified surface, as opposed to 569 s for the control. Scanning electron microscopy showed that far fewer platelets adhere to the modified surface (approximately 7 x 10(3)/mm(2)) as compared to the control (approximately 6 x 10(2)/mm(2)). Taken together, the experimental data reveal that the modified surface has excellent blood compatibility in vitro. It is discussed that the use of conjugate 1 leads to simultaneous exposure of dipyridamole at the modified surface and to a marked increase of the surface hydrophilicity, which is likely to hamper adsorption of plasma proteins. The combination of these effects is uniquely related to the molecular buildup of 1. Conjugate 1 will be used in future work that is aimed at preparing small-caliber polyurethane vascular grafts with a blood compatible lumenal surface.","DSM RES BV, NL-6160 MD GELEEN, NETHERLANDS","Aldenhoff, YBJ (reprint author), UNIV LIMBURG, CTR BIOMAT RES, POB 616, NL-6200 MD MAASTRICHT, NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,32,11,11,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1043-1802,,,BIOCONJUGATE CHEM,Bioconjugate Chem.,MAY-JUN,1997.0,8,3,,,,,296,303,,10.1021/bc970020z,,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Organic",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,XB627,WOS:A1997XB62700006,9177834.0,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies have demonstrated that the physical characteristics of the implant, and not the chemical composition, are the critical determinants of tumour development. The recent controversy over silicone breast implants has raised questions regarding the potential carcinogenicity of lifetime tissue exposure to silicone products. The present study was designed to determine whether the inflammatory and fibrotic reactions associated with silicone implants are due to a non-specific foreign-body reaction or whether these responses reflect the unique chemical composition of silicone. F344 rats were implanted subcutaneously with one of three biomaterials: silicone elastomer (Group 1), impermeable cellulose acetate filters (Group 2, positive control); or porous cellulose acetate filters (Group 3, negative control). The silicone and cellulose implants of Groups 1 and 2 have been previously shown to induce fibrosarcomas in rodents, whereas the porous cellulose acetate implants of Group 3 have been shown to be non-carcinogenic. One week and two months after implantation, the pericapsular tissues were evaluated using histopathological and in situ immunohistochemical analyses. Endpoints included expression of leucocyte antigens CD4 (T helper/inducer), CD8 (T suppressor/cytotoxic) and CD11 b/c (macrophage), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an indicator of proliferation, and in situ end-labelling (ISEL) of 3' OH DNA strand breaks as an indicator of DNA damage and apoptosis. The results indicated that the acute and chronic cellular responses to silicone (Group 1) were not different from impermeable cellulose filters (Group 2) of identical size and shape, suggesting that these responses were not unique to silicone. The inflammatory response to the carcinogenic cellulose and silicone implants (Groups 1 and 2) was attenuated and associated with the formation of a thick fibrotic capsule. In contrast, the porous cellulose filters (Group 3) induced a markedly different cellular response in which the inflammatory reaction was more extensive, prolonged and associated with minimal fibrosis. Within the fibrotic capsule surrounding the tumorigenic implants, but not the non-tumorigenic implants, cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death were increased and associated with persistent DNA strand breaks. Taken together, the results suggest that the micrometre-scale surface morphology of the implant determines the nature of the subsequent cellular response which may predispose to tumour development Further, these studies serve to emphasize the critical importance of appropriate physical controls in studies designed to evaluate carcinogenic or autoimmune manifestations associated with silicone implants in order to rule out the contribution of the chronic foreign-body reaction.

However, few studies have directly addressed the effects upon the adjacent soft tissue. The present study was designed to test the biological effects of various sized hydroxyapatite (HA) particles on myoblasts and fibroblasts. Both the myoblasts and fibroblasts were mixed in in vitro culture with 0.1% (1 mg ml(-1)) of various sized HA particles (0.5-3.0, 37-63, 177-250, 420-841 mu m) for 1 h, 3 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days to test their effects on the cell culture. The results show that adding HA particles into a cell culture can decrease the cell count significantly. The transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations in the culture medium decreased significantly on addition of HA particles. When calculated as a ratio to the cell number, the TGF-beta 1 titre increased most significantly in the groups of medium-sized particles. The prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) concentrations in the medium increased significantly. The changes in TGF-beta 1 and PGE(2) concentrations with the smallest particles were most significant and persisted longer. The inhibitory effects of the HA particles on the cell culture were mediated by the increased synthesis of PGE(2). Caution should be exercised before considering the use of an HA product which could easily break down into a fine powder.

Thrombin, a pivotal enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade primarily responsible for thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell activation, has been the target of numerous strategies to prevent this phenomenon from occurring. The purpose of this study was to covalently immobilize the potent, specific antithrombin agent recombinant hirudin (rHir) to a modified Dacron surface and characterize the in vitro efficacy of thrombin inhibition by this novel biomaterial surface. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was selected as the 'basecoat' protein, was reacted with various molar ratios of the cross-linker sulphosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulpho-SMCC; 1:5-1:50). These BSA-SMCC complexes were then covalently linked to sodium hydroxide-hydrolysed Dacron (HD) segments via the cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Covalent linkage of these complexes to HD (HD-BSA-SMCC) was not affected by any of the sulpho-SMCC cross-linker ratios assayed. rHir, which was initially reacted with 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's reagent) in order to create sulphydryl groups, was then covalently bound to these HD-BSA-SMCC surfaces (HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir). The 1:50 (BSA: sulpho-SMCC) HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments bound 22-fold more rHir (111 ng per mg Dacron) compared to control segments and also possessed the greatest thrombin inhibition of the segments evaluated using a chromogenic substrate assay for thrombin. Further characterization of the HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments demonstrated that maximum thrombin inhibition was 20.43 NIHU, 14.6-fold greater inhibition than control segments (1.4 NIHU). Thrombin inhibition results were confirmed by I-125-thrombin binding experiments, which demonstrated that the 1:50 HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments had significantly greater specific thrombin adhesion compared to control segments. Non-specific I-125-thrombin binding to and release from the 1:50 HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments was also significantly less than the control segments. Thus, these results demonstrate that rHir can be covalently bound to a clinically utilized biomaterial (Dacron) while still maintaining its ability to bind and inhibit thrombin.

Morphogenesis is the cascade of pattern formation and the attainment of form of the various organs and the organism as a whole. The periodontium consists of the periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. Bone has considerable potential for regeneration and therefore is a prototypic model for tissue engineering. The three main ingredients for tissue engineering are regulatory signals, responding stem cells, and extracellular matrix. Recent advances in molecular biology of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have set the stage for tissue engineering of bone and related tissues, including the periodontium. Bone-derived BMPs, with a collagenous matrix as carrier, induced cementum and alveolar bone regeneration in surgically created furcation defects in the primate. It is noteworthy that there was morphogenesis of periodontal ligament and a faithful insertion of: Sharpey's fibers into cementum, In the same furcation model, recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1, also known as BMP-7), in conjunction with the collagenous carrier, induced extensive cementogenesis with insertion of Sharpey's fibers into the newly formed cementum. The observation that BMPs induce cementogenesis and periodontal ligament formation indicates that these proteins may have multiple functions in vivo not limited to cartilage and bone induction. The rapid advances in the molecular biology of BMPs and their receptors bode well for novel strategies to engineer the regeneration of the periodontal tissues.","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT BIOL CHEM,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,LAB MUSCULOSKELETAL CELL BIOL,BALTIMORE,MD 21205","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), UNIV WITWATERSRAND,SCH MED,MRC,BONE RES LAB,7 YORK RD,ZA-2193 PARKTOWN,JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.",,,,,,,86,126,127,0,8,INT AMER ASSOC DENTAL RESEARCH,ALEXANDRIA,"1619 DUKE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-3406",1045-4411,,,CRIT REV ORAL BIOL M,Crit.

In this study, the effects of polylysine (a basic poly-amino acid with a net positive charge which is often used to coat biomaterials surfaces) on the erythroleukemic K562 cell membrane were investigated. In particular, the effects of this polycation were evaluated using dielectric relaxation studies in the radiofrequency range with which it is possible to measure both active ionic transport across the cell membrane (membrane conductivity) and the static charge distribution present on the cell surface due to the structural components of the cell membrane (membrane permittivity). The conductivity of the cytosol can also be determined. The results demonstrate that while the conductivity of the cytosol is not significantly altered, both the conductivity and permittivity of the K562 cell membrane are varied by exposure of these cells to polylysine. These observations indicate that both active ionic transport and the type, quantity, or distribution of membrane components such as lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides may also be altered. Although the precise mechanisms by which these variations in K562 cells occur are unknown, it can be hypothesized that changes in the growth characteristics of these cells may be in part responsible. In particular, as demonstrated by light microscopic examination of K562 cells directly in the culture flasks, the cells in polylysine-coated flasks do not grow in suspension as do the controls, but rather show anchorage-dependent-like behavior. It is this important change from suspension to monolayer growth induced by polylysine that may be responsible for the changes in membrane electrical parameters.

Setting: Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices, Department of Ophthalmology, Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Methods: Seven IOL styles comprising various biomaterials were studied: fluorine-treated (Fluorlens(TM)), heparin-surface-modified (HSM(TM)), hydrogel, Memory-Lens(TM), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), soft acrylic, and silicone lenses; the human crystalline lens was also studied. Each lens was immersed in silicone oil for 12 hours, then photographed, studied by scanning electron microscopy (except the crystalline lens), and subjected to computer-generated image analysis to determine the silicone oil coverage. Results: Silicone oil coverage of dry silicone lenses was 100% and of lenses immersed in normal saline, 82.5%. The least coverage was on the heparin-surface-modified lens (mean score 9.4%). Coverage of the other four lenses ranged from approximately 15.1% to 33.7%. Mean coverage of the human lens capsule was 10.9%. Conclusion: Although a silicone IOL shows maximal adherence to silicone oil, other lens biomaterials are not immune to this complication. Silicone oil coverage was related to the dispersive energy component of the surface charge of the IOL biomaterial. Low dispersive energy materials had less silicone oil coverage, while those with higher dispersive energy had more oil coverage.",,"Apple, DJ (reprint author), MED UNIV S CAROLINA,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,STORM EYE INST,CTR RES OCULAR THERAPEUT & BIODEVICES,CHARLESTON,SC 29425, USA.",,,,,,,19,59,64,0,8,AMER SOC CATARACT REFRACTIVE SURGERY,FAIRFAX,"4000 LEGATO RD, SUITE 850, FAIRFAX, VA 22030",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Last, but not least, repositioning of the facial mask is the ''final touch'' for these complex reconstructive procedures. The concept of total facial rehabilitation may be considered an evolution of reconstructive surgery. Surgical strategies, new technologies, as well as clinical cases will be presented.","UNIV FERRARA,CLIN MAXILLOFACIAL SURG,I-44100 FERRARA,ITALY","Clauser, L (reprint author), HOSP VICENZA,DEPT CRANIOMAXILLOFACIAL SURG,I-36100 VICENZA,ITALY.",,,,,,,9,2,2,0,0,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

Each segment was immersed in activated whole blood and the weight of the adherent thrombus was measured at specified intervals. At 6 and 7 min the saline-denucleated group accumulated significantly less thrombus than control (p <.05). Alginate alone was not significantly different from controls. The graft segments treated with alginate+iloprost accumulated significantly less thrombus (p <.05) than all other groups after 6 min.

The thermal properties of these films were characterized by dynamical mechanical thermal analysis and by differential scanning calorimetry as a function of their water content. During a temperature increase, the films produced sudden changes in mechanical property and specific heat, which are classicaly associated with the glass-rubber transition for amorphous materials. The glass transition was about 20 degrees C broad. Increasing the film water content involved a non-linear decrease in glass transition temperature. The thermodynamic theory of the glass transition (i.e. the Couchman-Karasz equation) was inadequate to describe fully the plasticizing effect of water on the films.

The mechanical properties of bioartificial materials prepared using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) as synthetic components, and collagen (SC), gelatin, starch, hyaluronic acid (HA) and dextran as biological components, were investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The materials were prepared in the form of films or hydrogels and treated by glutaraldehyde (GTA) vapour or thermal dehydration in order to reduce their solubility in water. The results indicate that SC/PVA, gelatin/PVA and starch/PVA films behave as biphasic systems, showing good mechanical properties over a wide range of temperature. It was observed that the GTA procedure affects only the biological component of the SC/PVA and gelatin/PVA blends, whilst the thermal treatment in fluences mainly the synthetic polymer. In the case of HA/PVA hydrogels, a modulus variation was found with the HA content related to the organization degree and perfection of the PVA network structure. It seems evident that, in the experimental conditions used, dextran/PAA mixtures behave as miscible blends showing a glass transition intermediate between those of the pure components. With both untreated and GTA-treated gelatin/PMAA blends, it was not possible to evaluate the miscibility of the systems; it could only be affirmed that these materials show good mechanical properties over a wide range of temperature.",,"Cascone, MG (reprint author), UNIV PISA,DEPT CHEM ENGN,VIA DIOTISALVI 2,I-56126 PISA,ITALY.",,,,,,,17,77,80,1,22,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

Pathologists must be aware of the controversy and treat each SBI and associated tissue as a potential lawsuit. Grossly, silicone is a clear, viscous substance that may be observed either within or extruding from a silastic bag. By light microscopy, silicone is a nonstainable, nonpolarizable, refractile substance. Thicker sections, especially when viewed by non-Kohler illumination, phase-contrast, and darkfield microscopy will enhance visualization. Ultrastructurally, silicone is an electron-dense, amorphous substance often located within phagocytic vacuoles or extracellularly within the stroma. Correlating electron probe microanalysis allows for reliable identification. In most cases, a fibrous capsule surrounds the SBI, with the interface lining varying from a virtually acellular to a synovial-like lining composed of phagocytic and secretory cells. Silicone can often be identified within the fibrous capsule and also in distant tissues biopsied for suspected autoimmune disorders, such as synovium, skin, and lymph nodes, often without ultrastructural evidence of cytologic effects. This study has demonstrated that silicone accumulates at distant tissue sites due to preexisting inflammation acting as a stimulus. Thus, silicone is not a primary inducer of inflammatory disease processes. These findings are supported by various large epidemiologic studies.","MED UNIV S CAROLINA,DEPT PATHOL & LAB MED,CHARLESTON,SC 29425",,,,,,,,46,15,16,0,1,HEMISPHERE PUBL CORP,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",0191-3123,,,ULTRASTRUCT PATHOL,Ultrastruct.

At neutral pH the interaction is quite weak but at acidic pH and especially below the isoelectric point of albumin the interaction becomes pronounced: about 0.42 g of heparin is bound per 1 g of albumin at pH 3. The stoichiometry of the complex at saturation corresponds to the state of charge equivalence. The dependence of heparin binding on the ionic strength shows an inexpressive maximum in ca. 0.2 M NaCl (pH 4.0), apparently due to a less extended conformation of heparin. The primary albumin monolayer adsorbed on a solid support by hydrophobic interaction can serve as an anchor for the sequential adsorption of alternating monolayers of heparin and albumin and thus multiple layers with a sandwich-like architecture are deposited on the surface, The adsorption in each step reaches saturation determined by the charge equivalence and the composition of the bilayers tends to be the same regardless of their distance from the surface. The approach described makes it possible to cover surfaces with a regular multilayer of a required and uniform thickness.

The methodologies to assemble optobioelectronic devices are reviewed. One method involves the chemical modification of redox enzymes with photoisomerizable units and their integration with electrode surfaces. In one photoisomer state the protein structure is perturbed and its bioelectrocatalytic activities are blocked. In the second photoisomer state, the tertiary structure of the protein is retained and the enzyme exhibits bioelectrocatalytic functions. This method is exemplified by the chemical modification of glucose oxidase (GOx) with photoisomerizable nitrospiropyran units and with the reconstitution of apo-GOx with the photoisomerizable nitrospiropyran-FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide phosphate) cofactor. The two systems enable the cyclic amplified amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoactive proteins. The second approach to assemble optobioelectronic systems involves the organization of photoisomerizable monolayers on electrode surfaces acting as 'optical command surfaces' for the control of the electrical contact between redox proteins (or redox enzymes) and the electrode. This method is exemplified by the control of the electrical contact of cytochrome c (Cyt. c) with a functionalized electrode consisting of a mixed monolayer of pyridine/nitrospiropyran assembled onto an Au-electrode. The ON-OFF photostimulated electrical contact of Cyt. c with the electrode is coupled to mediated electron transfer cascades, i.e. bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of oxygen by cytochrome oxidase (COx). The systems allow the amplified amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoisomerizable monolayer-electrode. The photochemically-triggered activation or deactivation of the electrical communication between Cyt. c and the electrode, originate from the association or repulsion of the protein From the photoisomerizable monolayer-electrode interface. This enables the microgravimetric transduction of the optical signals recorded by the monolayer using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The photostimulated electrical contact of Cyt. c and the electrode, and the subsequent activation of an electron transfer cascade via the electrobiocatalyzed reduction of oxygen by COx, allow the amplified amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the monolayer-functionalized-electrode. Reversible immunosensors based on photoisomerizable antigen monolayers assembled onto electrodes represent another configuration of an optobioelectronic device. Assembly of an antigen monolayer on electrodes yields an active interface for the amperometric transduction of the association of the complementary antibody (Ab) to the monolayer. Binding of the Ab to the monolayer blocks the electrical contact of a redox enzyme, i.e. ferrocene-modified glucose oxidase (Fc-GOx), with the electrode, and inhibits the electrobiocatalyzed oxidation of glucose. A photoisomerizable antigen assembled as a monolayer on an electrode allows the tailoring of reversible immunosensing interfaces. In one photoisomer state, the monolayer acts as an active interface for amperometric detection of the antibody. The complementary photoisomer state lacks affinity for the Ab and allows the washing-off of the antibody and the regeneration of the active antigen monolayer by a second illumination cycle. This approach is exemplified by the application of a dinitrospiropyran monolayer assembled onto an Au-electrode as a reversible sensing interface for the dinitrophenyl antibody (DNP-Ab). The dinitrospiropyran monolayer, SP-state, acts as an active interface for the association of the DNP-Ab. Photoisomerization of the monolayer to the dinitromerocyanine configuration, MRH+-state, allows the washing-off of the DNP-Ab and the regeneration of the active SP-monolayer electrode by a secondary photoinduced isomerization. The reversible photostimulated binding and dissociation of DNP-Ab to and from the electrode is transduced by the application of Fc-GOx as odor probe and is further supported by microgravimetric QCM analyses.

Microspheres were made by the solvent evaporation method using an oil/water (o/w) system. The brain protein adsorption experiment was performed by using a sonication eluting method. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to examine the brain proteins adsorbed. Ethyl cellulose microspheres were used in the study as a reference. The amount of brain proteins adsorbed on PLGA microspheres was also determined using a radiolabeling technique. The extent of brain proteins adsorbed on the PLGA microspheres was found to be lower than that adsorbed on the ethyl cellulose microspheres. The adsorption of brain proteins on PLGA microspheres, however, was significant, as indicated quantitatively by the I-125 labeling studies. The adsorption of brain proteins on the surface of the PLGA microspheres may be important when considering the use of this polymer as a brain implant delivery system.","UNIV GEORGIA,COLL PHARM,ATHENS,GA 30602",,,,,,,,30,10,10,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",1071-7544,,,DRUG DELIV,Drug Deliv.,APR-JUN,1997.0,4,2,,,,,129,134,,10.3109/10717549709051884,,,,6,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,YJ343,WOS:A1997YJ34300010,,,,,2019-02-25

Design: Experimental open study. Setting: Experimental research centre, France. Material: 21 mongrel dogs randomised into three groups of 7 each. Intervention: Standard transverse colonic end-to-end anastomoses were secured with two-layer oxidised collagen I + III sponge covered with thin crosslinked collagen IV film (APP 1) glued around the suture (n = 7); two-layer oxidised collagen I + III sponge covered with thin non-crosslinked collagen I + III film patch (APP 2) (n = 7); or sealed by fibrin sealant (n = 7), which acted as a controls. Main outcome measures: Gross examination, radiological control (barium enemas), and microscopic examination on day 35 postoperatively. Results: Gross clinical and radiological examinations on day 35 showed normal wound healing in all but one dog in which the anastomoses had occluded by day 16. There was significantly less stricturing with the APP 2 patch (p < 0.05 compared with the controls). Microscopic examination showed complete absorption of the APP 2 patches as well as quicker mucosal and extracellular matrix repair than controls. The APP 1 patch gave the best healing of the muscular layer but did not reduce anastomosis stricturing, and was not totally absorbed. Conclusions: Collagen supporting devices do not alter healing of the large bowel. Encircling patches do not increase the number of adhesions or the rate of anastomotic stricturing and a thin fibrillar collagen I + III dense layer may even improve it. The speed of absorption of the patch depends on the type of dense collagen film. These results argue for a prospective clinical evaluation in humans.","IRCAD,EUROPEAN INST TELESURG,STRASBOURG,FRANCE; HOP CIVIL,CHIRURG CLIN A,F-67091 STRASBOURG,FRANCE; IMEDEX SA,SADUC BIOMAT,CHAPONOST,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,10,10,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) known as poly(HEMA) has a number of limitations as a biomaterial, which is illustrated in its use as soft contact lenses where, even though it is found to be mechanically adequate, ocular incompatibility is observed leading ultimately to the formation of ''white spot deposits'' on the lens surface. Hydrogels synthesized during this study are polyethylene oxide modified poly(HEMA) based gels.

The merits of such treatments are, however, strongly dependent on the process parameters. In the present work the possibilities, limitations, and risks of plasma treatment for surface preparation of metallic materials are investigated experimentally using titanium as a model system, and also discussed in more general terms. Samples were treated by different low-pressure direct current plasmas and analyzed using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and light microscopy. The plasma system is a home-built, ultra-high vacuum-compatible system that allows sample introduction via a load-lock, and precise control of pressure, gas composition and flow rate, etc. This system allows uniform treatment of cylindrical and screw-shaped samples. With appropriate plasma parameters, argon plasma remove all chemical traces from former treatments (adsorbed contaminants and other impurities, and native oxide layers), in effect producing cleaner and more well-controlled surfaces than with conventional preparation methods. Removal (sputtering) rates up to 30 nm/min are possible. However, when inappropriate plasma parameters are used, the result may be increased contamination and formation of unintentional or undesired surface layers (e.g., carbides and nitrides). Plasma-cleaned surfaces provide a clean and reproducible starting condition for further plasma treatments to form well-controlled surface layers. Oxidation in pure O-2 (thermally or in oxygen plasmas) results in uniform and stoichiometric TiO2 surface oxide layers of reproducible composition and thicknesses in the range 0.5-150 nm, as revealed by AES and XPS analyses. Titanium nitride layers were prepared by using N-2 plasmas. While mild plasma treatments leave the surface microstructure unaffected, heavy plasma treatment can give rise to dramatic morphologic changes. Comparison of these results with corresponding analyses of commercial implants and electropolished and/or anodically oxidized samples shows that the plasma treatment offers superior control of the surface status. However, it is also shown that improper control of the plasma process can produce unwanted and irreproducible results.

In the present study, to develop a drug delivery system with higher bioacitivity in hard tissues by using the self-setting bioactive carbonate apatite cement, we have investigated the effects of sodium bicarbonate content on the in vitro drug release from a self-setting bioactive carbonate apatite cement containing indomethacin (IMC). Methods. The cement powder systems constituted an equimolar mixture of tetracalcium phosphate (Ca-4(PO4)(2)O) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4 . 2H(2)O), hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) seed crystals and sodium bicarbonate. Two types of 2% IMC loaded-cements were prepared as follows, one containing 0% HAP seed crystal and 0-10% sodium bicarbonate, and the other containing 40% HAP seed crystal and 0-10% sodium bicarbonate. The drug release profiles from 2% IMC loaded-cements were measured in simulated body fluid at pH 7.25 and 37.0 degrees C. Results, The drug release profiles from the cement matrix systems with or without seed crystals were estimated using a moment analysis computer program. The mean drug release time (MDT) and the time required for 50% drug release of the cement containing 0 and 40% seed crystal decreased with an increase of sodium bicarbonate. Furthermore, after the drug release the total pore volume of the cement matrix, as measured by mercury porosimetry, increased with an increase of sodium bicarbonate. Conclusions. MDT and T-50's were a function of adding the amount of sodium bicarbonate. The results of the relationship between the micropore distribution, total volume of pores after drug release and drug release supported the hypothesis that the variation in drug release from the cements resulting from the addition of sodium bicarbonate was mainly due to an increase in the diffusion of the drug in the micropores of the cement by dissolution or erosion of the cement matrix.","UNIV UTAH,DEPT PHARMACEUT & PHARMACEUT CHEM,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112","Otsuka, M (reprint author), KOBE UNIV,DEPT PHARMACEUT TECHNOL,MOTOYAMA KITAMACHI 4-19-1,KOBE,HYOGO 658,JAPAN.",,,,,,,19,12,14,1,7,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0724-8741,,,PHARMACEUT RES,Pharm.

Several unit operations can be applied, e.g. filtration, centrifugation and ultrafiltration. On a production scale at DSM, filtration was used to separate the biocatalyst, but its performance was not satisfactory. Therefore, research was carried out in order to improve filtration and to develop an alternative separation process, in this case ultrafiltration, In filtration the use of a body feed of filter aid is required to avoid formation of a slimy layer of cells and cell debris on the filter cloth, which would cause a dramatic decrease in the filtration rate. A precoat of filter aid proved not to be necessary. The porous cake formed by gradual deposition of filter aid on the filter favours a high filtration rate and retention of biomaterials. The best results were obtained with a high grade of perlite, at a concentration of 10 to 15 kg/m(3) for a biocatalyst concentration of 4.3 kg/m(3). The observed average filtration rate for a batch time of 80 min and at a pressure of 2.5 bar was 580 kg/m(2) h. The filtrate was not entirely clear: the protein retention was 50%. This means that the proteins remaining in the filtrate must be removed in another process step, e.g, carbon adsorption. By means of ultrafiltration, a very clear permeate was obtained as all the cells, cell debris and enzymes were retained by the membrane (molecular weight cut-off 25 000 Da). The highest flux was observed at a high cross-flow velocity, 3.9 m/s. At low transmembrane pressure, 3.4 bar, the flux had approximately the same value as at 10.7 bar. From our experiments, it can be concluded that once a fouling or gel layer is formed, it is stable and it will not be removed by increasing the cross-flow velocity, lowering the pressure, etc. At a concentration factor of 10 and a batch time of 6 h the average flux observed was 25 kg/m(2) h. The protein retention was approximately 99%. The investment and operational costs are lower for ultrafiltration than for pressure filtration. However, due to a process alteration at a later date, neither an UF unit nor a filtration unit were required. The negative effects of the presence of enzymes and cell debris in the product solution were compensated by using carbon adsorption, which was already installed for the purification of the product.",,"Meindersma, GW (reprint author), DSM RES BV,BASE CHEM & HYDROCARBONS,POB 18,NL-6160 MD GELEEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,18,6,6,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Class V cavities were prepared and filled with different restorative materials in 20 healthy premolars to be extracted for orthodontic reasons. Teeth were extracted at different time intervals, fixed, demineralized, and embedded in paraffin. Six-micrometer-thick sections were cut serially and mounted on slides and every fifth section was stained using hematoxylin and eosin or Masson's trichrome, and served to localize the inflammatory reaction. The slides corresponding to the bulk of the inflammatory reaction were then used for immunohistochemical detection of the inflammatory cells using monoclonal antibodies: CD15 (granulocytes and histiocytes), CD45RO (T lymphocytes and monocytes), Pan-B cell (B lymphocytes, macrophages, and a subpopulation of T lymphocytes), CD45RA (B lymphocytes and monocytes), and EMA (plasma cells). The slides were observed and submitted to computerized image analysis using a SAMBA 2000 system for counting of the cells. The CD15, CD45RO, Pan-B-cell, and CD45RA antibodies positively stained the target cells, which could be counted with the computer. The EMA antibody did not permit staining of cells. These results indicate that polymorphonuclears, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes are present in inflamed human dental pulp. The immunologic detection of inflammatory cells followed by computerized image analysis allows an accurate characterization of pulpal pathology, and could be useful for the study of pulp reactions to restorative biomaterials.

A new oxide layer was grown by oxidation in nitric acid or by annealing at 700 degrees C in air. At this temperature, reaction with nitrogen is unlikely. The purity of the oxidized sheet-titanium surfaces was investigated by Auger spectroscopy. The composition of both surfaces was TiO2 with carbon impurities. The carbon content of the acid-oxidized titanium was 20 +/- 2%, and the carbon content of the heat-oxidized titanium was 14 +/- 2% The initial reactions of the TiO, surfaces with blood were investigated by short-time exposure to capillary blood and by detection of surface-adsorbed plasma proteins and cells with immunofluorescence. Antibodies specific to fibrinogen, complement factor Clq, prothrombin/thrombin, and platelet membrane antigen were used, and the fluorescence was quantitated by computer-aided image analysis. The results show that serine proteases are the dominating proteins adsorbed onto annealed titanium (Clq = 67 +/- 4.6; pt/t = 97 +/- 0.2; fib = 47 +/- 0.2). The adsorption of serine proteases was lower and the amount of fibrinogen was higher on the acid-oxidized surface (Clq = 46.3 +/- 2.6; pt/t = 25 +/- 2.9; fib = 64 +/- 0.7). Platelets adhered and spread on the annealed titanium surface within 5 sec of blood-material contact. The number of adhering platelets was higher on the add-oxidized surface.

Crosslinking influences the mechanical properties, resorption kinetics, and biocompatibility of collagen-based biomaterials. In this study, we evaluated the effects of crosslinking on collagen fiber-fibroblast interactions in vitro. Collagen fibers were left untreated or crosslinked by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment (3 or 5 days), or hexamethylenediisocyanate (HMDIC) exposure. The initial attachment, proliferation (through 8 days), and morphology of human dermal fibroblasts were evaluated on control and crosslinked bundles of 200 collagen fibers in vitro. Initial attachment (number of fibroblasts at day 0) was increased on UV and DHT5-treated collagen fiber bundles. Fibroblast proliferation was similar for control, UV crosslinked, and DHT crosslinked fibers. In contrast, fibroblast attachment was significantly decreased and proliferation was delayed on HMDIC crosslinked fibers. These results, coupled with our previous studies, suggest that UV crosslinking of collagen fibers provides a combination of biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and strength retention suitable for various tissue engineering applications.

In this study, the effect of the two most common sterilization techniques, ethylene oxide and gamma-irradiation (0.3, 1.1, 3.9, 6.4, 10.6 Mrad), was evaluated for a family of four structurally related tyrosine-derived polycarbonates and for poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). The four polycarbonates were poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), poly(DTH carbonate), and poly(DTO carbonate) and differed only in the length of the pendent chain. Ethylene oxide exposure had little effect on molecular weight, surface composition, mechanical properties, or degradation rate of all test polymers except for poly(DTO carbonate). Poly(DTO carbonate) was unique since following ethylene oxide exposure it degraded faster than did the nonsterilized control. gamma-Irradiated tyrosine-derived polycarbonates retained over 81% of their initial molecular weight when exposed to a clinically relevant dose of 3.9 Mrad and retained still 58% of the initial molecular weight when exposed to the highest test dose of 10.6 Mrad. No changes in surface composition and only slight changes in yield strength and the Young's modulus were detected for any of the tyrosine-derived polycarbonates following gamma-irradiation. In vitro, irradiated films of poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), and poly(DTH carbonate) degraded at approximately the same rate as did the nonsterilized films regardless of irradiation dose. Only poly(DTO carbonate), irradiated at high doses, degraded faster than did the control. Medical-grade PLLA was tested under identical conditions. Ethylene oxide exposure of PLLA did not affect the molecular weight, surface composition, mechanical properties, or in vitro degradation rate. However, upon irradiation at 10.6 Mrad, PLLA retained only 29% of its initial molecular weight; a dose of 3.9 Mrad resulted in retention of 49% of the initial molecular weight. In correspondence with earlier publications, irradiation of PLLA induced significant losses in the Young's modulus, % strain at break, and changes in the postirradiation rate of degradation in some specimens. Compared to PLLA, tyrosine-derived polycarbonates are significantly more stable to gamma-irradiation and can be sterilized by conventional gamma-sterilization techniques.

While it is generally accepted that the surface topography of an implant influences the formation of bone and affects its performance, few systematic studies have dealt with this important feature. Quantification of the mineralized tissue at the implant interface has typically been attempted using histologic methods or conventional radiographic procedures. However, histologic methods are often technically demanding and time consuming, whereas conventional radiographic procedures lack resolution and sensitivity to identify small areas of mineralization. The objective of this study was to study systematically the effects of micromachined surfaces on bone formation by applying digital radiographic techniques to identify and quantify mineralized tissue. Titanium-coated epoxy replicas of 19 different micromachined grooved or pitted surfaces that ranged between 30 and 120 mu m deep, as well as smooth control surfaces, were implanted percutaneously and fixed to the parietal bone of rats. After 8 weeks the implants and attached tissue were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy. A total of 316 implant surfaces were processed, radiographed using conventional and digital techniques, and sectioned for histologic observations. The area of the bonelike tissue and its density were calculated using National Institutes of Health Image software. Mineralization was frequently noted at the interface of some types of micromachined surface but rarely on smooth surfaces. The presence of bone in histologic sections and areas identified as bone through digital radiography and image processing correlated strongly. The frequency of bonelike foci formation decreased as the depth of the grooves increased. In contrast, mineralization occurred more frequently as the depth of the pit increased. In addition, bonelike foci were oriented along the long axis of the grooves. It is thus feasible that the bonelike tissue is shaped, directed, or engineered to a predetermined configuration which is dictated by the surface topography. This study indicated that surface topography influences the frequency as well as the amount of bone deposited adjacent to implants, and mineralized product can be guided by the surface topography. Moreover, digital radiography and image processing can be used reliably to identify and quantify mineralized tissue at the implant interface.

Its anatomical structure was investigated and its mechanical properties were measured and compared with those of some common bone-bonding or bone-repairing biomaterials. It is found that, among all kinds of biomaterials, bamboo has the closest modulus of elasticity to human long bone. The cytotoxicity of bamboo was tested using the agar overlay method before and after heat or chemical treatments. The results reveal that ethanol, methanol and toluene can remove toxic leachable components from bamboo to some extent through extraction. After grafting a polymer whose molecule includes poly(ethylene glycol), alpha,omega-di(aminopropyl)poly(ethylene glycol) 800 on bamboo, bamboo has the ability to form a calcium phosphate coating after being immersed in calcification solution (simulated body fluid and accelerated calcification solution). The characteristics and the morphology of the mineral formed on bamboo were studied by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

These molecules, as mediators of cell adhesion, could play a role in the modulation of adhesion on the biomaterials, therefore conditioning the response of tissues to implant. Twenty different cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in contact with knitted Dacron. Both HUVECs grown without the material and HUVECs incubated with endotoxin were used as control. After 24 h, the cell adhesion molecules PECAM-1, ELAM-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were evaluated on the cells by monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. After 24 h of contact with knitted Dacron, a significant decrease in the proportion of cells expressing PECAM-1 was observed, as well as a significant increase in the proportion of cells expressing ELAM-1. The contact with knitted Dacron did not induce significant variations of ICAM-1 and VACM-1. The incubation with endotoxin determined a significant increase in the proportion of ELAM-1-positive cells, a significant increase in ICAM-1 fluorescence intensity, and a significant increase both in fluorescence intensity and in the proportion of VCAM-1-positive cells. The results obtained with the endotoxin are in agreement with those reported in the literature. The ELAM-1 increase, observed after contact with knitted Dacron, could favour leucocyte adhesion, while the decrease in PECAM-1 expression could result from an inhibiting effect on the endothelial cell adhesion so as to hinder the mechanisms involved in the endothelialization of the material. The variations were interpreted as inhibiting endothelialization and favouring the leucocyte adhesion effect by knitted Dacron.

This study examines the influence of surface properties on the adherence of the respiratory isolates Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to PVC. In particular, the influence of respiratory tract physiological conditions, 5% CO2 and saliva, on adherence was investigated. In general, decreased adherence to PVC was observed when bacteria were grown in CO2. When these CO2-grown bacteria were treated with saliva their adherence to PVC significantly increased; however, their adherence was significantly reduced to saliva-treated PVC. Treatment of both bacterial isolates with saliva decreased their negative zeta potential, a factor which may directly contribute to the observed increased microbial (saliva pretreated) adherence to PVC. Cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) was evaluated by measuring the initial rates of microbial removal from a buffered aqueous phase, to ensure the absence of electrostatic interactions, to an organic phase (xylene). Under physiological conditions, CSH did not appear to be a dominant factor in biomaterial adherence as the CSH of S. aureus was decreased by saliva treatment but was unchanged for Ps. aeruginosa. Additionally, CSH also differed for the two isolates when grown in CO2, significantly decreasing with S. aureus but remaining unaltered with Ps. aeruginosa. Saliva treatment of PVC also decreased the advancing and receding contact angles of the biomaterial and its surface roughness, which may be a factor in the decreased adherence of saliva-treated bacteria to this surface. Alternative biomaterials or surface modifications appear necessary for the desired improvements in ET tube effectiveness. This study highlights the influence of physiological conditions on biomaterial and bacterial surface characteristics and subsequent interactions. It is imperative that the physiological conditions predominating in the clinical area of biomaterial use be considered when investigating device biocompatibility.

Materials and methods Pre-cut segments of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) prostatic stents were incubated with two common uropathogenic bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) with and without previous immersion in antibiotic solution. Tobramycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin solutions were used, as these antibiotics are commonly administered for the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). Results Immersion in ciprofloxacin solution prevented the adherence of both bacterial strains, Immersion in ceftriaxone solution prevented only the adherence of the E, coli strain. Immersion in tobramycin solution had no effect on either of the strains. The stent materials per se did not influence bacterial adhesion, After immersion in ciprofloxacin, the stent segments retained significant antibacterial activity even after one day's incubation in saline. Conclusion Immersion in a suitable antibiotic solution may significantly reduce and even prevent bacterial adhesion onto biodegradable prostatic stents. Preventing bacterial adhesion may reduce the risk of UTI during the use of these devices.","UNIV BARI,SCH MED,I-70121 BARI,ITALY; UNIV HELSINKI,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; TAMPERE UNIV TECHNOL,INST PLAST TECHNOL,FIN-33101 TAMPERE,FINLAND; PAIJAT HAME CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,LAHTI,FINLAND",,,,,,,,15,13,13,0,5,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0007-1331,,,BRIT J UROL,Br.

Methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (MPEG sulfonate)-modified chitosan was prepared by allowing the base polymer to swell in an acidic medium, followed by polyelectrolyte complexation and interpenetration of MPEG sulfonate with the chitosan matrix. Addition of a strong base collapsed the base polymer to permanently immobilize the modifying agent on the surface. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) confirmed the presence of MPEG sulfonate on chitosan and the high resolution Cls peak showed an increase in -C-O- which is indicative of the ethylene oxide residues. The number of adherent platelets and the extent of platelet activation was significantly reduced on MPEG sulfonate-modified chitosan. Compared to an average of more than 66 fully activated platelets on unmodified chitosan surface, only 3.0 contact-adherent platelets were present on MPEG sulfonate-modified chitosan. Plasma recalcification time, a measure of the intrinsic coagulation reaction, was about 11.5 min in contact with modified chitosan. The results of this study show that chitosan surface can be modified by the complexation-interpenetration method with anionic PEG derivative. Surface-immobilized MPEG sulfonate was effective in preventing plasma protein adsorption and platelet adhesion and activation by the steric repulsion mechanism.

To assess the interfacial bonding strength, this study examined a fracture mechanics approach using a bilayer compact sandwich (BCS) specimen, in which a bilayer coupon comprising the interface between tissue and biomaterial was sandwiched between two holders. First, the theoretical basis for measuring interfacial fracture toughness using the BCS specimen was developed. Next, the effect of finite interlayer thickness on the measurements was addressed and a correction factor was determined using finite element analysis techniques. Accordingly, the theoretical solution was modified to account for the effect of the interlayer thickness. Finally, using a bone to bone-cement interface the BCS technique was empirically verified in terms of overall size, material combination, and interlayer thickness. It is expected that the BCS technique will provide an effective means for researchers to study and analyze tissue-biomaterial interfaces.

The ISO gives the standard requirements for testing biomaterials provided for implantation. Our primary interest was the establishment of a reliable in vitro panel as a useful and relevant screening system for vascular implant devices to evaluate blood/device interactions under flow conditions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate influences of different flow conditions on blood cell-biomaterial interactions with special emphasis on the interactions of human granulocytes (PMN) and polymeric surfaces. PMN were isolated and vital cells were quantified by flow cytometrical analysis directly before, as well as immediately after the experiments. The viscosity of the final cellular suspension was analysed by using a computerized cone-plate rheometer. As reference materials we used FEP-teflon, PVC-DEHD, PU, PP and PE. Dacron and ePTFE synthetic vascular protheses were tested in a comparative way to those references. The adhesion processes were observed over a period of 40 minutes under arterial (shear stress 0.74 Pa) and venous (shear stress 0.16 Pa) flow conditions in a parallel plate flow chamber system under highly standardized conditions and laminar flow. The cells were observed with the help of inverse light microscopy. Cell behaviour was recorded and analysed in both analogue (video) and digital (imaging system) modes. Samples of the cell suspensions were obtained at regular time intervals and analysed by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify LTB(4) release. Irrespective of the material, approximately 3 to 4 times more PMN adhered to the biomaterial surfaces under venous flow conditions compared to the arterial. Shear intensity did not influence the running order of biomaterials with respect to cell numbers. This response in descending order at the end of the experiments was as follows: PU, PVC-DEHD, PP, PE and ePTFE. The biochemical analyses indicate that in the system used only a weak effect on LTB(4) release induced by the different materials could be determined. A significant effect caused by flow conditions was not observed.

Important aspects of interfacial biology, including the underlying biological mechanisms and methodology, are presented. Of the latter the combination of morphological techniques with methods of cell and molecular biology as well as molecular genetics (so-called ''combinative techniques'') are particularly useful.

The prepared PEO-entrapped PMMA film surfaces were characterized by the measurement of water contact angle and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The stability of PEO entrapped in PMMA films was also examined by immersing the films in water for up to 7 days with continuous shaking and measuring the weight changes. The behavior of plasma protein adsorption and platelet adhesion on the PEO-entrapped PMMA film surfaces was investigated. It was observed that the plasma protein adsorption and platelet adhesion on the film surfaces decreased with increasing PEO molecular weight and its surface density.

While issues of national sovereignty are likely to present difficulties, the international medical device community shares fundamental goals, and the potential benefits to global harmonization are substantial. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is collaborating currently with international organizations on an approach to attain these goals, with excellent results. The devices approach to harmonization presented at the meetings of the Global Harmonization Task Force in June 1995 is described. FDA believes a stepwise approach to harmonization is an effective and efficient approach to making progress. To do this, all parties must agree on steps to achieve harmonization in each area. It is highly desirable that each country reach the same definitions of tissue and tissue-engineered products and jurisdictional assignments for regulatory review, avoiding overlaps, so that the industry can deal more economically with regulatory oversight. The controls that the FDA applies to tissue-engineered products are discussed as well as the need to determine which major consensus standards group can organize the development of global, not just European, standards for tissue-engineered products. The FDA pledges its support to work toward regulatory harmonization of these products.","US FDA,CTR DEVICES & RADIOL HLTH,ROCKVILLE,MD 20857",,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,2,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,SPR,1997.0,3,1,,,,,79,83,,10.1089/ten.1997.3.79,,,,5,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,XN989,WOS:A1997XN98900010,,,,,2019-02-25

These included differential granular wear (alumina grains and yttrium-stabilized alumina grains at different depths), multidirectional scratches with heaped up boundaries, and incompletely sintered grains, as well as the formation of craters and separation of grain boundaries. The femoral heads in this small series of revision cases show that yttrium-stabilized alumina ceramic heads may develop surface irregularities from either manufacturing processes or in vivo use.

The effects of implants on bony tissue have been investigated. The effects upon adjacent skeletal muscles have not been determined. The focus of this work is to elucidate the biological effects of various calcium phosphate bioceramics on skeletal muscles. Four different kinds of powder of calcium phosphate biomaterials including beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), hydroxyapatite (HA), beta-dicalcium pyrophosphate (beta-DCP) and sintered beta-dicalcium pyrophosphate (SDCP), were tested by myoblast cell cultures. The results were analyzed by cell count, cell morphology and concentration of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in culture medium. The cell population and TGF-beta 1 concentration of the control sample increased persistently as the time of culture increased. The changes in cell population and TGF-beta 1 concentration in culture medium of the beta-TCP and HA were quite low in the first 3 days of culture, then increased gradually toward the seventh day. The changes in cell population and TGF-beta 1 concentration in culture medium of the silica, beta-DCP, and SDCP were quite similar. They were lower during the first day of culture but increased and reached that of the control medium after 7 days' culture. Most cells on beta-TCP and HA diminished in size with radially spread, long pseudopods. We conclude that HA and beta-TCP are thought to have an inhibitory effect on growth of the myoblasts. The HA and beta-TCP may interfere with the repair and regeneration of injured skeletal muscle after orthopedic surgery.

We obtained cell growth only on samples previously immersed 15 or 22 days in complete culture medium. We describe a dissolution/precipitation phenomenon on the HA coating surface assessed by modifications of Ca and P concentrations in the culture medium, by the transformation of the HA coating into carbonated HA (X-ray diffraction and infrared spectrometry) and by the presence demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy of spherocrystallites on the HA after 15 days of immersion. Our results show that adult human bone-derived cells are apparently particularly sensitive to the changes in the coating surface induced by liquid immersion.

The bone-grafting material (HAS) was implanted into two adult patients, and small biopsies were recovered 6 months after implantation. The raw biomaterial was analyzed by x-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Six months after their implantation, the HAS aggregates were surrounded by a mineralized bone matrix. Tiny crystallites also filled the spaces between the HAS crystals within the aggregates. These newly formed crystallites growing at the surfaces of the implanted HAS crystals appeared to be apatitic. The crystallographic investigations of the nucleation and growing mechanisms of the newly formed crystallites were performed by HRTEM in association with computer simulation and mathematical processing of digitized images. A relationship was noted between the orientation axes of crystallites growing nearby and the zone axes of the implanted HAS, thus strongly suggesting a guiding or substratum role of the HAS particles.","INST GENET & BIOL MOL & CELLULAIRE, F-67404 ILLKIRCH GRAFFENSTADEN, FRANCE","Hemmerle, J (reprint author), INSERM, U424, FEDERAT RECH ODONTOL, 11 RUE HUMANN, F-67085 STRASBOURG, FRANCE.",,,,,,,29,13,14,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-0345,1544-0591,,J DENT RES,J.

In the present study, human alveolar bone cells were cultured in alpha-minimal essential medium (alpha-MEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 mu g/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate and either in the presence or in the absence of 10 nM dexamethasone (Dexa). Cultures were characterized concerning cell viability/proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP) and tartraric acid resistant phosphatase (TRAP) activities, and formation of mineralized areas. Cell proliferation increased gradually for approximately 20 days. In the presence of Dexa, cells formed isolated or interconnected multilayered clusters that increased with culture time. Histochemical assays revealed strong positive reactions for ALP and calcium and phosphates deposits, mainly in relation to cells associated with the clusters. High levels of ALP activity (biochemical determination) were observed. Cells cultured in the absence of Dexa showed significantly lower ALP activity and no calcium and phosphates deposits were present. Serially passaged cells kept the proliferation rate constant but a decrease in ALP activity was observed either in the presence or in the absence of Dexa. The ability to form mineralized areas (cultures fed with Dexa) also decreased on serial subculture.","INST CIENCIAS BIOMED ABEL SALAZAR,P-4000 OPORTO,PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO,P-4719 BRAGA,PORTUGAL; INEB,INST BIOMED ENGN,P-4000 OPORTO,PORTUGAL","Fernandes, MH (reprint author), FAC MED DENT,RUA DOUTOR ROBERTO FRIAS,P-4200 OPORTO,PORTUGAL.",,"Fernandes, Maria Helena/K-6917-2014; Carvalho, Graca S./M-5669-2015","Fernandes, Maria Helena/0000-0001-9391-9574; Carvalho, Graca S./0000-0002-0034-1329; Costa, Maria Adelina Coelho/0000-0001-7664-2075",,,,27,33,33,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

It is therefore essential to use a very sensitive index of toxicity. We have compared the sensitivity of four well-established indices of toxicity: total cell protein content, leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reduced glutathione content and the MTT assay, with that of a novel index, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Comparisons were made by detecting nickel chloride toxicity in osteoblasts. ALP activity, the novel method, proved the most sensitive index of toxicity and it provides a convenient automated assay for assessing the interactions of materials with osteoblasts. The responses to nickel chloride and to aqueous extracts prepared from carbon fibre reinforced epoxy and polyetheretherketone (peek), two candidate materials for orthopaedic implants, were compared in primary and immortalized rat osteoblasts, and in primary human osteoblasts. Although the immortalized rat osteoblast cell line, FFC, was consistently the most sensitive cell type, the responses of the human cells and the FFC cell line were similar in terms of ALP activity throughout the range of nickel concentrations studied. Neither peek nor epoxy material extracts showed a significant decrease in the MTT or ALP responses in any of the three cell types. Our data suggest that immortalized rat osteoblasts may provide an in vitro model system for screening the biocompatibility of orthopaedic polymers.","UNIV PAISLEY,DEPT BIOL SCI,PAISLEY PA1 2BE,RENFREW,SCOTLAND; KAROLINSKA HOSP,DEPT ORTHOPAED,S-10401 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","Macnair, R (reprint author), UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,WOLFSON CTR,106 ROTTENROW,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,23,33,38,1,6,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

To determine the cellular events occurring in the presence of HA, human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLF) were isolated and maintained in culture. The specificity of the cells was evidenced by their morphology, deposition of extracellular matrix components, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (as a marker of osteoblastic differentiation of HPLF). Phase-contrast investigations revealed morphological alterations of cells in contact with HA particles. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the phagocytotic process of HPLF toward HA particles. Moreover, the presence of HA particles was significantly related to an increase in the protein synthesis activity and a decrease in the proliferation and ALP-specific activity of HPLF. These results provide new information on the phenotypic expression of HPLF, which is comparable to that of osteoblastic cells. A subpopulation of HPLF may be influenced by the presence of HA to undergo transient dedifferentiation prior to redifferentiating into osteoblasts. This process may be important as a means by which HA acts as an osteoconductive material. This experimental study improves our understanding of the cellular processes which occur during healing and regeneration of periodontal defects after implantation of biomaterials.","ACAD CTR DENT AMSTERDAM,NL-1066 EA AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; INST BIOL,INSERM U419,NANTES,FRANCE","AlliotLicht, B (reprint author), FAC CHIRURG DENT,LAB RECH INTERDISCIPLINAIRE TISSUS CALCIFIES & BI,PL ALEXIS RICORDEAU,F-44042 NANTES,FRANCE.",,"GREGOIRE, Marc/G-2867-2013","GREGOIRE, Marc/0000-0003-3868-0198",,,,42,19,25,0,1,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Ordered arrangements of porous channels have been produced in silica-based materials by post-synthetic removal of surfactant templates from inorganic-organic mesostructures(6,7). The resulting pore sizes are commensurate with the packing dimensions of the organic molecules, and are currently limited to length scales of up to 10 nm. Here we show how a bacterial superstructure, consisting of a thread of coaligned multicellular filaments of Bacillus subtilis(8,9), can be used to extend the length scale of inorganic materials patterning, We produce ordered macroporous fibres of either amorphous silica or ordered mesoporous silica(6,7) (MCM-41) by template-directed mineralization of the interfilament spaces followed by removal of organic material by heating to 600 degrees C. The inorganic macrostructures consist of a macroporous framework of 0.5-mu m-wide channels with curved walls of either silica or mesoporous silica, 50 to 200 nm in thickness. The formation of ordered pores In the MCM-41 replica on both the mesoscopic and macroscopic length scales illustrates how supramolecular and supercellular templates might be combined for the fabrication of inorganic materials with structural hierarchy.","UNIV BATH,SCH CHEM,BATH BA2 7AY,AVON,ENGLAND; UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT MOL & CELLULAR BIOL,TUCSON,AZ 85721",,,"Mann, Stephen/D-1332-2012","Mann, Stephen/0000-0003-3012-8964",,,,23,560,576,5,135,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,JAN 30,1997.0,385,6615,,,,,420,423,,10.1038/385420a0,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WF007,WOS:A1997WF00700047,,,,,2019-02-25

Spectral heterogeneity in the 400 nm range, assumed to be associated with the M-intermediate state, previously characterized for films of 4-keto wild-type BR, was observed in the 4-keto D96N mutant BR. This heterogeneity is associated to a greater extent with chromophore replacement than with amino acid replacement. The time constants of the M-decay are larger for all kinetic components for 4-keto D96N mutant in the absence of sodium azide. In addition, the contribution of the most long-lived component of the M-state decay is almost twice as large as for the film without sodium azide as it is for a film with sodium azide. This sodium azide effect on the M-state decay kinetics is opposite to that observed in the 4-keto wild-type BR.

The decreasing amount of calcium concentration in SBF during the drug release increased with increase of time. This was attributed to in vitro precipitation and/or growth of hydroxyapatite on the cement. The plasma IMC concentration and the area under the curve (AUG) from 1, 2 and 5% IMC-loaded cements after s.c. administration in rat depended on the loaded LMC concentration in the cements.

The PLGA polymers degrade by bulk hydrolysis of ester bonds and breakdown into their constituent monomers, lactic and glycolic acids which are excreted from the body. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of manufacturing procedure on the in vitro degradation of two PLGA copolymers, 85:15 and 50:50, which were fabricated as implants, Implants were compressed from microcapsules prepared by nonsolvent induced phase separation using two solvent-nonsolvent systems, viz., methylene chloride-hexane (non-polar) and acetone-phosphate buffer (polar). Studies were performed at pH 4.5, 7.4 and 9.4 and polymer degradation was monitored by measuring the decrease in number- and weight-average molecular weights (M(n) and M(w)), mass loss, formation of lactic and glycolic acids and pH of the degradation medium. Representative scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) were also obtained to study the changes in surface morphology of the implants. Results of these studies indicated that both PLGA 85:15 and 50:50 implants prepared by the non-polar procedure degraded faster than the implants prepared by the polar procedure. The decrease in polymer M(n) and M(w) followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Changes in M(n) and M(w) occurred before the onset of mass loss, after which implant mass loss was described by pseudo first order kinetics. The appearance of lactic and glycolic acids corresponded to the initiation of mass loss and also resulted in decrease in pH of the bulk degradation medium. The SEMs indicated that water uptake was faster in implants prepared by the non-polar method resulting in a more porous matrix which degrades more rapidly. Finally, the average degradation time for PLGA 85:15 was approximate to 26 weeks and that for PLGA 50:50 was 6-8 weeks.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,MED CTR,DRUG INFORMAT & EPIDEMIOL CTR,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV NEBRASKA,MED CTR,COLL PHARM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,OMAHA,NE 68105","Ramchandani, M (reprint author), INTEGRA LIFESCI CORP,105 MORGAN LANE,PLAINSBORO,NJ 08536, USA.",,,,,,,19,45,47,2,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-3659,,,J CONTROL RELEASE,J.

In physiological solutions it is able to self-assemble to form a macroscopic matrix that stains with Congo red. On raising the temperature of the aqueous solution above 70 degrees C, an abrupt structural transition occurs in the CD spectra from a beta-sheet to a stable alpha-helix without a detectable random-coil intermediate. With cooling, it retained the alpha-helical form and took several weeks at room temperature to partially return to the beta-sheet form. Slow formation of the stable beta-sheet structure thus shows kinetic irreversibility. Such a formation of very stable beta-sheet structures is found in the amyloid of a number of neurological diseases. This oligopeptide could be a model system for studying the protein conformational changes that occurs in scrapie or Alzheimer disease. The abrupt and direct conversion from a beta-sheet to an alpha-helix may also be found in other processes, such as protein folding and protein-protein interaction.

Epi-fluorescence microscopy shows that the enzyme remains active. The enzyme retention was investigated in the conditions of enzyme activity detection by immersion of the protein-lipid LB films in the suitable alkaline buffer. This study showed that the interactions between the enzyme and either the head or the tail groups of behenic acid were strong enough to avoid enzyme desorption during overnight immersion in the buffer. Furthermore, the retained enzyme preserves the structure of the behenic acid multilayers during their immersion in the alkaline buffer; transformation into behenate multilayers which normally occurs if the enzyme is not present. This protecting role of the GlDH molecules against the modification of the behenic acid multilayer structure, probably contributes to a slowing down of the hydration of the underlaying layers by the buffer.","UNIV LYON 1,LAB GENIE ENZYMAT,CNRS,UPRESA 5013,F-69622 VILLEURBANNE,FRANCE",,,,"Girard-Egrot, Agnes/0000-0003-2612-3124",,,,18,32,34,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,JAN 5,1997.0,292,1-2,,,,,282,289,,10.1016/S0040-6090(96)08954-7,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,WK359,WOS:A1997WK35900045,,,,,2019-02-25

Single bubble sonoluminescence produces much more symmetric bubble collapse with subsequently much higher effective temperatures during collapse. In cold liquids, bubble cloud cavitation is able to drive reactions that normally occur only under extreme conditions. Examples include activation of liquid-solid reactions and synthesis of amorphous and nanophase metals, and the synthesis of novel biomaterials, especially protein microspheres.

After 24 hours perfusion, the differences in protein exposition between heparinized and unheparinized polymers were substantially reduced.","LUND UNIV, DEPT MED MICROBIOL, S-22362 LUND, SWEDEN; LUND INST TECHNOL, DEPT SOLID STATE PHYS, LUND, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT LAB MED, S-10401 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT MED, S-10401 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; UNIV LUND HOSP, DEPT NEUROSURG, S-22185 LUND, SWEDEN",,,"Tegenfeldt, Jonas/B-9506-2008; Montelius, Lars/B-9071-2008","Tegenfeldt, Jonas/0000-0002-3695-6886; Montelius, Lars/0000-0001-9563-2307",,,,50,10,10,0,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0001-6268,,,ACTA NEUROCHIR,Acta Neurochir.,,1997.0,139,8,,,,,734,742,,10.1007/BF01420046,,,,9,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,XT967,WOS:A1997XT96700015,9309288.0,,,,2019-02-25

Since 1970, devices, tissues, and records have been evaluated with the total now exceeding 3,800 devices. Most of these explants have been from orthopaedic and oral surgical procedures. The studies have been protocol driven with the magnitudes of each investigation separated into three tiers. Tier one includes anticipated outcomes, tier two isolates those situations where changes are noted but are judged not to have influenced the clinical outcome, while tier three is specific to unanticipated outcomes or areas of interest related to research and development projects. Results. from these studies have demonstrated considerable value, and observations can always be reported with confidence. However, to determine cause-effect relationships, hypotheses must be developed from the observations and more in-depth physical and biological science-based investigations conducted to establish validity and statistical significance. Examples where observations from explanted devices have resulted in analyses that have influenced the device design and material selections include: (1) corrosion and biodegradation of metallic alloys; (2) device surface coatings for functional attachments to bone; (3) minimization of wear for articulating surfaces of total joint arthroplasties (THAs), and (4) synthetic matrices for tissue augmentation and regeneration. Studies of the biodegradation of metallic materials stemmed from observations of enhanced corrosion due to galvanic coupling within dental implant constructs. Subsequent in vitro electrometric evaluations of corrosion have been quantitatively predictive and alloy combinations can now be selected to minimize biocorrosion phenomena. Investigations into the causes of biomechanical fracture and biochemical dissolution of first generation calcium phosphate coatings on metallic dental and orthopaedic devices has now resulted in enhanced technology to produce higher quality coatings with controlled properties that meet recently established national standards. The quantification of articulating surface wear of polyethylene components within TJA has caused a re-emphasis of alternate bearing materials and metal-on-metal plus ceramic-on-ceramic devices now being evaluated after longer-term implantation periods (10-20 year follow-up). Longer-term analyses of various synthetic material matrices used as scaffolds and fillets within bone grafts are now providing key insights into how these compositions and forms have been tolerated in vivo. This information is now proving to be a key resource for the selection(s) of appropriate biomaterials for combinations with active macromolecular substances or stem cells intended to directly influence tissue regeneration. Methods for conducting a program for the analysis of retrieved surgical implants will be reviewed and examples discussed to show how these types of studies have significantly influenced the reconstructive surgical discipline.","UNIV ALABAMA, SCH DENT, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA; UNIV ALABAMA, SCH MED, DEPT BIOMAT, DIV ORTHOPAED SURG, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA","Lemons, JE (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA, SCH MED,DEPT SURG,1919 7TH AVE S,RM 616, SDB BOX 29, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA.",,,,,,,40,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER IBERICA,BARCELONA,"PROVENZA 388, E-08025 BARCELONA, SPAIN",1130-2283,,,AN QUIM-INT,An.

The poor results of these vascular grafts may be attributed to the fixatives, aldehydes, used in fixing tissues. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a new fixative, epoxy compound, has recently been used to fix biological vascular grafts. The study was undertaken to investigate the crosslinking characteristics, fixation index and denaturation temperature, of various porcine arteries fixed with an epoxy compound. The porcine arteries investigated in the study were the common carotid artery, internal thoracic artery, abdominal aorta, and saphenous artery. In addition, the effects of sonication on the porcine arteries before fixation on their cross-linking characteristics were analyzed. The fresh and glutaraldehyde-fixed arteries were used as controls. It was noted that glycine, proline, and alanine were the most abundant amino acids found in the porcine internal thoracic artery. In the amino acid analysis, it was observed that the amino acids in the porcine arteries reacted with epoxy compound or glutaraldehyde were lysine, hydroxylysine, histidine, and arginine. Of these amino acids, lysine was the most reactive. In general, the fixed arteries were relatively stiffer than their fresh counterparts. The fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of various porcine arteries were comparable throughout the entire fixation process. The amounts of free amino groups of the sonicated arteries were significantly lower than those of their unsonicated counterparts (p < 0.05). It is speculated that the diminishing free amino groups of the sonicated arteries may be attributed to the removal of the destroyed cell debris and adherent proteins of the arteries after sonication. However, it was learned that sonication on the porcine arteries before fixation did not seem to affect their fixation indices and denaturation temperatures. The results obtained in this study may help one in selecting the raw materials for developing a small-diameter biological vascular graft.","VET GEN HOSP,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,TAIPEI,TAIWAN; PIG RES INST,DEPT COMPARAT MED,TAIPEI,TAIWAN","Sung, HW (reprint author), NATL CENT UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,CHUNGLI 32054,TAIWAN.",,,,,,,34,9,9,0,6,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Drug release rates, bacterial colonization and morphological features of the polymer-ciprofloxacin combinations were studied and the physico-chemical mechanisms of the delivery were discussed. Ciprofloxacin salt showed a fast initial release rare, whereas ciprofloxacin-betaine was characterized by a more continuous release behaviour. A higher diffusity of the lipophilic ciprofloxacin-betaine in the polymer could be shown as compared to its salt incorporated into the polyurethane. The high initial burst effect of the hydrochloride antibiotic was caused by its high solubility in the elution medium. Bacterial colonization tb the antibiotic-loaded polyurethanes was inhibited effectively only by preparations showing a slower but more sustained drug release. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that the polyurethane-antibiotic combination was most homogenous for ciprofloxacin-betaine. Polyurethane material loaded with ciprofloxacin salt showed crystals at the surface and a granular structure of the polymeric matrix. Crystalline structure of the drug on polymeric surfaces varied with loading concentration and lipophilicity. Physico-chemical similarity of the polymeric material and the antibiotics is important for the homogeneity of the polymer-antibiotic combinations. High homogeneity is required for a sustained and prolonged release and effective inhibition of bacterial colonization.","UNIV TECHNOL,RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,DEPT ANESTHESIOL,D-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY; UNIV COLOGNE,INST MED MICROBIOL & HYG,D-5000 COLOGNE 41,GERMANY","Schierholz, JM (reprint author), B BRAUN MELSUNGEN AG,FORSCH & ENTWICKLUNG,NURNBERGER STR 55,D-34212 MELSUNGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,20,22,22,0,4,ECV-EDITIO CANTOR VERLAG MEDIZIN NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,AULENDORF,"BANDELSTOCKWEG 20, POSTFACH 1255, D-88322 AULENDORF, GERMANY",0004-4172,,,ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCH,Arzneimittelforschung,JAN,1997.0,47,1,,,,,70,74,,,,,,5,"Chemistry, Medicinal; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Chemistry,WG945,WOS:A1997WG94500014,9037447.0,,,,2019-02-25

Experimental variables included surface treatments of CPT and porcelain firing schedules. Variables for the surface treatments were (1) sandblasting, (2) mono- and triple-layered nitridation, and (3) mono-layered chrome-doped nitridation. Variables for the porcelain firing schedule included (4) bonding agent application, (5) bonding agent plus gold bonding agent application, and (6) Procera porcelain application. All together eleven sample groups were prepared with different combination of aforementioned experimental variables. Statistically all of them exhibited no significant differences. Hence, we employed two further criteria; (I) the minimum bond strength should exceed the maximum porcelain strength per se, and (II) the CPT substrate should not be heated close to the beta-transus temperature. After applying these criteria, it was concluded that mono-layered nitridation and mono-layered application of chrome-doped nitridation on both (with and without) sandblasted and non-sandblasted surfaces were the most promising conditions for a successful Titanium-Porcelain System.","INDIANA UNIV,SCH DENT,DEPT RESTORAT DENT,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202",,,,,,,,53,26,28,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

Human lymphocytes were cultured in semi-physiological medium which had been previously exposed to biomaterial extracts of commercially pure titanium following ISO standards. In order to visualize the location of induced DNA strand breaks, cells were then exposed to exonuclease III which partially digests and amplifies lesions by releasing nucleotides at free 3' hydroxyl ends from nicked double-stranded DNA. The resulting single-stranded DNA was allowed to hybridize with short oligonucleotides of random sequences including biotinylated dUTP. After random priming using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, incorporation of biotin-dUTP was detected by immunogold binding to the chromatin. Cells exposed to a mutagenic concentration of methyl methanesulfonate, as a positive control, showed a significantly higher and stronger gold staining than both titanium-exposed and unexposed specimens. This assay allows a precise localization and quantification of both in vitro DNA breakage and DNA repair. It could provide a powerful tool for rapid assessment of the genotoxic potential of new biomaterials.","Univ Montreal, Pediat Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; Univ Montreal, Dept Surg, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; Univ Montreal, Dept Pathol, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; Hop St Justine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada",,assad@justine.umontreal.ca,,"Assad, Michel/0000-0001-8734-0267",,,,37,5,5,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

This work focusses on two polymers that contain covalently bound iodine, rendering the materials radio-opaque. The first material is hard, transparent and glass-like, and consists of methyl methacrylate, 2-(2'-iodobenzoyl)-ethyl methacrylate (1) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), in the molar ratio 65:20:15, respectively. The second material is a cross-linked hydrophilic network, consisting of HEMA and 1, in the molar ratio 80:20, respectively. Both materials were characterized by means of different physico-chemical techniques, including magic-angle-spinning solid state NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, both materials were implanted subcutaneously in rats for 24 days. Upon explantation and histological examination, it appeared that both materials are well tolerated. No tissue necrosis, abscess formation or inflammation were observed. The samples were found to be surrounded by a vascularized capsule consisting of connective tissue cells. The results reveal excellent tissue compatibility for both materials. This is an important observation, since tissue compatibility is absolutely necessary for the applications which are foreseen for this type of radio-opaque biomaterials.

In this work the intensity of phagocytosis of carbon fibres obtained by carbonization of polyacrylonitrile was studied both for HNO3 etched and non-etched fibres. Part of the powdered material studied was placed in plasma before it was contacted with cells. To study the material, which was first placed in plasma and then contacted with cells, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used. It was found that the powders made from the etched fibres are phagocytized more intensively. It was also found that the absorption of plasma proteins enhances the phagocytosis only for the fibres oxidized in HNO3 and has no influence in the case of powders obtained from non-etched fibres.

On this material, rat bone cells were visible in Ivac mode only in cells traversing pores, when they were readily identified by their cell nuclei. Rat calvarial bone examined uncoated in Ivac mode showed the bone structure clearly through the overlying layer of osteoblast cells, which were subsequently revealed by gold coating. Immunogold labelling of alkaline phosphatase was imaged in Ivac mode, following silver enhancement and carbon coating.

Histological and histometric evaluation of trial areas adjacent to the implants showed that by week 1 the glass-ionomer granules were encircled by a conspicuous capsule surrounded by immature connective tissue. By week 3 the implants were surrounded by a less prominent fibrous capsule and most of the tested area was occupied by mature trabecular bone. By week 6 the fibrous capsule was thinner and the tested area was almost totally covered by bone, which was in close contact with the implanted material in several places. Quantitative data confirmed progressive new bone formation in parallel with a decrease in the percentage fraction of connective tissue in the trial areas around the implants. The results revealed that the tested material is biologically compatible, being progressively incorporated into alveolar bone in the wound healing process. The quantitative evaluation of alveolar wound healing around a glass-ionomer implant may provide an experimental model for future comparative studies carried out with other biomaterials.

Moreover, dipyridamole is essentially non-toxic. The drug is used extensively in clinical anti-coagulation regimes, for example pre- and post-coronary angioplasty procedures. Recently, we have found that photochemical, covalent coupling of dipyridamole to polyurethane surfaces leads to improved thromboresistance in vitro. This phenomenon is now studied in more detail. Both qualitative and more quantitative biochemical experiments were performed in order to characterize the in vitro blood compatibility of a set of polyurethane surfaces onto which dipyridamole was immobilized. First, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphology of platelets which adhered during incubation with platelet-rich plasma. These experiments showed that immobilization of dipyridamole leads to a clearly decreased number of adherent platelets and to a largely diminished propensity of the surface to activate adherent platelets. Secondly, an in vitro thrombogenicity assay was run. These experiments showed that the thromboresistance increased with increasing surface density of immobilized dipyridamole. A short spacer chain, separating dipyridamole from the polymer surface, was found to improve the thromboresistance further. Such a spacer chain apparently increases the efficacy of the immobilized drug. Collectively, the present results further substantiate the idea that dipyridamole retains its inhibitory activity with respect to activation and aggregation of blood platelets, when the compound is covalently attached to a polymer surface. The possible utility of these findings with respect to the development of an artificial blood vessel prosthesis is discussed briefly.

Four stages are identified: supramolecular preorganization and spatial patterning; interfacial molecular recognition in inorganic nucleation; vectorial crystallization; and pattern evolution and hierarchy. Each of these concepts can be translated into synthetic approaches to the formation of inorganic materials with organized architectures. An example of applying this biomimetic paradigm is described. Supersaturated water-in-oil microemulsions have been used to synthesize microskeletal calcium phosphates by controlled nucleation and vectorial growth in constrained reaction environments.

In the last five years it has been widely recognised that UHMWPE wear debris generated from the articulating surfaces of total artificial joints is a major cause of osteolysis and failure in these devices. The adverse cellular reactions that cause loosening are controlled by the number and type of UHMWPE wear particles generated by the different wear processes and tribological designs. The E.C. has funded a Brite Euram Project to investigate wear of UHMWPE, which involves experimental and theoretical investigations of wear processes, quantification of wear debris, analysis of cellular reactions to particles that cause bone resorption and prediction of tribological design solutions that can reduce the adverse cellular reactions and osteolysis. In this paper we present one aspect of the project which is a new method to isolate and quantify polyethylene wear debris from biological solutions and tissues, which analyses the mass and frequency distribution of the particles as a function of size in the range 0.1 mu m to 1000 mu m. The results show that analysis of the particle frequency distribution is not adequate to differentiate between different types of debris or to quantify the total number of particles. The analysis of the mass distribution as a function of particle size not only differentiates between different types of debris but can also allow the quantification of the total number of particles generated per unit mass of debris. For typical clinical wear volumes, this analysis predicts between 50 and 900 x 10(9) wear particles per year. Identification of tribological designs that can reduce this burden on the biological tissue is critically important.",,"Fisher, J (reprint author), UNIV LEEDS,DEPT MECH ENGN,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,NETHERLANDS SOC MATERIALS SCIENCE,ZWIJNDRECHT,"PO BOX 390, N-3330 ZWIJNDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,90-803513-3-4,,,,1997.0,,,,,,,543,545,,,,,,3,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Materials Science,BJ43N,WOS:A1997BJ43N00125,,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro experiments have proved that MA 956 with and without scale exhibits an excellent corrosion behaviour being the corrosion intensities lower than those of metallic biomaterials in use. It is worth to remark that scale decreases the corrosion intensity at least up to two orders of magnitude with respect to the uncoated material, which corrosion behaviour is also excellent. The elevated compressive residual stresses in the scale guarantee its integrity during tensile deformation and account for the good fatigue and wear behaviour.

We evaluated the biocompatibility of a gamma ray crosslinked poly(ethylene oxide) gel in two critical situations. Materials and methods In 3 rabbits, a 5 mm inner diameter annular channel of 1 mm width was delaminated at 80 % corneal depth and a sterile gamma ray crosslinked polyethylene oxide gel was injected in the channel. In cornea 1 (control), the annulus was centered on. the corneal apex and the channel was fully filled with gel. In cor-nea 2, the delamination was purposely decentered and the channel was approximately 1 mm from the limbus at ifs closest point. In corrnea 3, the centered channel was purposely partially filled. After a 6 month follow-up, the rabbits were sacrificed for histology. Results Histopathology showed the oval channel walls to be irregular and a slight thinning of the epithelium located above the implant but no abnormalities in the stromal thickness. No mononuclear, po nuclear cells or other signs of encapsulation or rejection were found around the polymer in any the animals. In cor-nea 3, fibroblasts were found on the lateral sides of the hydrogel globules. No limbal neovascularization tvas observed over the 6 month period in any of the animals. Conclusions The injected PEO gel followed intimately the delaminated stromal channel and was well tolerated in the cornea. The fibroblastic reaction found in partially filled channels is caused by the normal wound healing process and not by the hydrogel chemical properties.",,"Legeais, JM (reprint author), UNIV PARIS 06,HOTEL DIEU,INSERM U86,SERV OPHTHALMOL,1 PL PARVIS NOTRE DAME,F-75004 PARIS,FRANCE.",,,,,,,30,2,2,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0181-5512,,,J FR OPHTALMOL,J.

Formation of dense and tightly-bonded surface layers may prevent plasma protein adsorption owing to steric repulsion. General conditions for formation of layers, protecting blood components from direct contacts with the surface, are discussed. It seems to be necessary to ensure a delicate balance between adsorption energy of the attached chains and their length. The crucial point is to get a high grafting density which is more influential than high chain length. Length should be calibrated to the size of protein molecules to meet both effective repulsion and high density of the protecting chains and to avoid chain displacement by plasma proteins.","Fachhsch Osnabruck, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia","Kummerlowe, C (reprint author), Fachhsch Osnabruck, Albrechtstr 30, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany.",,,,,,,30,0,0,0,3,GORDON BREACH SCI PUBL LTD,READING,"C/O STBS LTD, PO BOX 90, READING RG1 8JL, BERKS, ENGLAND",0021-8464,,,J ADHESION,J.

The synthesized IABb copolymers contained higher boron and amine moieties than the LAB copolymer. The results of the dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that IABb copolymer-coated surfaces showed a relatively hydrophobic nature, changing to hydrophilic in response to the aqueous environment. BAECs cultured on the copolymer substrata developed into capillary networks after 7 days. This is probably due to the enrichment of boron and amine segments in the vicinity of the hydrophilic copolymer surface, enhancing more pronounced interaction of boronates with cell membrane glycocalyx. The introduction of n-butyl methacrylate into the polymers might enhance the diffusion of the hydrophobic segments to the bulk polymers and the concentration of relatively hydrophilic segments at the outermost polymer surfaces by contact with water. A copolymer (IAP) without boronic acid groups was also prepared using N-phenylacrylamide (P) as a comonomer instead of 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid in the IAB copolymer to investigate the effect of boronic acid moieties on the capillary formation of the cultured cells. Although the endothelial cells seeded on the copolymer without boronic acid groups adhered during the early culture period, these cells showed neither proliferation nor differentiation and detached from the surface after 13 days. These results strongly support the opinion that the phenylboronic acid groups in the copolymers are responsible for the specific induction of tissue formation of BAECs through the interaction with glycoconjugates on the cell membranes.","Sophia Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 102, Japan; Tokyo Womens Med Coll, Inst Biomed Engn, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 162, Japan; Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Mat Sci, Noda, Chiba 278, Japan; Sci Univ Tokyo, Biosci Res Inst, Noda, Chiba 278, Japan","Okano, T (reprint author), Sophia Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 102, Japan.",,"Okano, Teruo/J-4028-2012; Kataoka, Kazunori/K-7108-2012","Kataoka, Kazunori/0000-0002-8591-413X",,,,24,4,4,0,16,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The IPN-structured hydrogels were synthesized by sequential cross-linking reaction of N-methacryloyl-glycylglycylglycyl-terminated PEG and Dex. In vitro degradation of the IPN-structured hydrogels was examined using papain and dextranase as model enzymes of hydrolyzing oligopeptide and Dex, respectively. Specific degradation in the presence of papain and dextranase was observed in the IPN-structured hydrogel with a particular composition of oligopeptide-PEG and Dex. This same hydrogel was not degraded by one of the two enzymes. The IPN-structured hydrogels were characterized by water content, thermal mechanical analysis, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and the results were compared with those of co-cross-linked hydrogels consisting of N-methacryloyl-glycylglycylglycyl-terminated PEG and methacryloyl Dex. The results suggest that the IPN-structured hydrogels contain physical chain entanglements between networks as well as chemical cross-linked networks. It is concluded that the double-stimuli-responsive degradation observed in the IPN-structured hydrogel is achieved by controlling the chain entanglements between the two biodegradable polymers. Such degradation property of the IPN-structured hydrogel can be useful as a fail-safe system for guaranteed drug delivery and/or medical micromachines.","JAPAN ADV INST SCI & TECHNOL,SCH MAT SCI,TATSUNOKUCHI,ISHIKAWA 92312,JAPAN",,,"KURISAWA, MOTOICHI/C-1325-2014","KURISAWA, MOTOICHI/0000-0003-2413-6933",,,,26,28,28,4,17,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecylsilane (ODS) surfaces have been applied as models for different biocompatible materials. By immunofluorescence we could demonstrate that FN receptors organize on the: dorsal cell surface of adhering fibroblasts in a specific linear pattern along with actin filaments, but only if the cells were attached to hydrophilic glass. In contrast, FN receptors were not reorganized on hydrophobic octadecylsilane (ODS). In parallel experiments, FN matrix formation after 72 h of incubation on the same substrata has been analyzed microscopically, and quantified by cell ELISA, in order to be further correlated with the integrin receptor functioning in contact with the biomaterials. II was found that FN structuring and the amount of FN matrix have been significantly diminished on ODS that was related to the observed changes in integrin receptor functioning. To learn more about the mechanism of this phenomenon, desorption of I-125-FN from these substrata was studied and found to be significantly decreased on hydrophobic ODS. As a consequence, FN receptor (function) might be arrested on the ventral cell surface, thus the important role of beta 1 integrins in the positional organization of the FN matrix may be disturbed. In light of these facts, antibody-induced clustering of FN receptor can be considered as a useful model for studying the early steps of FN matrix formation on biomaterials.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH, INST CHEM, ABT MEMBRANFORSCH, D-14513 TELTOW, GERMANY","Altankov, G (reprint author), BULGARIAN ACAD SCI, INST BIOPHYS, STR ACAD G BONCHEV, BL 21, BU-1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,42,46,46,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Membranes based on pure polyacrylonitrile, or its copolymers differing in their content of acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and allylsulphonate were investigated with respect to kallikrein-like activity, and physicochemical surface properties. It was found that high content in 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and acrylic acid caused a substantial activation of the contact system while low content in allylsulphonate (less than 2 mol%) did not result in enhanced kallikrein-like activity. The activating materials were characterized to be highly wettable, and had the most negative zeta potentials.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN, SCH MED CHARITE, SCH DENT, DEPT PROSTHET, D-10098 BERLIN, GERMANY","Groth, T (reprint author), GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH, INST CHEM, DEPT MEMBRANE RES, KANTSTR 55, D-14513 TELTOW, GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,40,18,19,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

HeLa S3 cells were cultured on these substrates for 24 h. The expressed HSP 70s mRNA was then isolated and detected using the RT-PCR method. As a result, the expression of HSP 70B mRNA was largely induced in cells that adhered to hydrophilic surfaces. On the other hand, on hydrophobic surfaces, the HSP 70B mRNA expression was low. It is concluded that HSP 70B mRNA expression is sensitive to differences in the hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity of the substrates.","KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN",,,,,,,,21,17,17,0,1,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Data concerning its possible influence on bacterial attachment and resistance to biomaterial-associated infection are, so far, lacking. In the present work, the in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, one isolate of each species, to plain poly(vinyl chloride) (plain PVC) and heparin coated poly(vinyl chloride) (EPA-PVC) segments was compared. Also, the influence of precoating the segments with human normal plasma for 2 h was studied. S-35-Methionine was used to radiolabel bacteria. The segments were exposed to bacterial suspensions of approximately 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter at 37 degrees C for 0.5-6 h. Following repeated washing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), radioactivity associated with the segments was measured. Plain PVC as compared to EPA-PVC bound significantly more cells of all three tested species. Plasma precoating significantly decreased adherence of the tested species to plain PVC but did not affect the binding to EPA-PVC. However, after precoating with human plasma, EPA-PVC compared to plain PVC showed a higher binding of S. aureus which might possibly be due to bridging effects of fibronectin or other plasma proteins, interacting with S. aureus.","LUND UNIV, DEPT THORAC SURG, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN; LUND UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN; LUND UNIV, DEPT MED MICROBIOL, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN","Zdanowski, Z (reprint author), LUND UNIV, DEPT SURG, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,35,14,15,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Specifically, measurements of fibrinogen adsorption, platelet adhesion, kallikrein generation, and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) release were performed. The catheter materials examined in this study included: platinum-cured, 50 shore A durometer, barium sulfate-filled, silicone (SI); Tecoflex EG85A-B20 polyurethane (PU); PU catheters whose outer surface had been impregnated with ion beam-deposited silver atoms (AgI and AgII); PU catheters coated with a hydrophilic, polyacrylic acid polymer (UC); PU catheters coated with an air-cured PTFE emulsion (CS); and PU catheters coated with an aminofunctional dimethylsiloxane copolymer (JG). The time course of fibrinogen adsorption from plasma to the SI, JG, PU, and CS materials was similar, with CS exhibiting the least amount of adsorbed fibrinogen after 1 h (65 +/- 4.7 ng cm(-2)) and PU the greatest (144 +/- 16.5 ng cm(-2)). After 90 min of contact, AgI and AgII exhibited the greatest number of adherent platelets, levels that were approximately two to three times higher than those on the other catheter materials. With the exception of UC and PU, which caused kallikrein generation levels approximately half that of the positive (glass) control, little kallikrein formation was observed for any of the materials relative to the negative control. Finally, FPA generation was greatest using the SI: CS, and PU materials, with the latter causing the production of almost four times the amount of FPA as the negative control. This preliminary assessment of the hemocompatibility of the various catheters suggests that the surface treatments did not adversely affect their interactions with blood components; further investigations of these materials are therefore warranted in order to completely characterize their behavior prior to use in clinical situations.","UNIV MEMPHIS,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,MEMPHIS,TN 38152; SIMS DELTEC INC,DEPT RES & DEV,ACCESS SYST DIV,ST PAUL,MN 55112",,,,,,,,19,7,7,1,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The intermediate was then subjected to a transesterification to form the PPF-based polymer. This method allowed for production of a polymer with a number average molecular weight up to 1500 and a polydispersity index of 2.8 and below. The polymeric backbone structure was investigated through the use of FTIR and NMR. Kinetic studies of the transesterification allowed mapping of the molecular weight increase with reaction time.

As a model system, release of recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) from this polymer was evaluated. The polyphosphate was synthesized using a triethylamine catalyst in an argon environment, and characterized using elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Degradation kinetics of the polyphosphate polymer in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were represented by a second-order polynomial while degradation in bovine serum was linear with time. The polymer degraded faster in PBS than in bovine serum. In vitro release of OP-1 was also faster in PBS than in serum. Release kinetics of OP-1 in PBS and serum were represented by second-order polynomials. The OP-1 release from this physically dispersed polymeric matrix may be described by several possible mechanisms: diffusion, bulk polymer degradation, ion complexation, and interactions among the protein (OP-1), polymer, proteins, and enzymes in the media. This polyphosphate may be an effective carrier for morphogens, growth factors, or other classes of bioactive molecules.

We have previously shown that monocytes and macrophages responding to particles of bone cement are capable of differentiating into osteoclastic cells which resorb bone. To determine whether the radio-opaque additives barium sulphate (BaSO4) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) influence this process, particles of PMMA with and without these agents were added to mouse monocytes and cocultured with osteoblast-like cells on bone slices, Osteoclast differentiation, as shown by the presence of the osteoclast-associated enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and lacunar bone resorption,,vas observed in all cocultures. The addition of PMMA alone to these cocultures caused no increase in TRAP expression or bone resorption relative to control cocultures, Adding PMMA particles containing BaSO4 or ZrO2, however, caused an increase in TRAP expression and a highly significant increase in bone resorption, Particles containing BaSO4 mere associated with 50% more bone resorption than those containing ZrO2. Our results suggest that radio-opaque agents in bone cement may contribute to the bone resorption of aseptic loosening by enhancing macrophage-osteoclast differentiation, and that PMMA containing BaSO4 is likely to be associated with more osteolysis than that containing ZrO2.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, NHS TRUST, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND",,,"Murray, David/D-7117-2011",,Wellcome Trust,,,37,105,107,0,8,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",0301-620X,2044-5377,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

Antibodies directed against platelet membrane antigen and P-selectin were used to visualize platelet adhesion and activation. Acridine orange and anti-CD11b were used to detect adhesion and activation of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs). Antibodies against thrombospondin were used as markers for platelet alpha-granules. The fluorescence intensity was quantitated by computer-aided image analysis. Commercially pure, polished sheet titanium was oxidized in two different ways: (1) the natural oxide was dissolved with hydrofluoric acid and a new oxide layer was grown by oxidation in nitric acid, or (2) annealing was performed at 700 degrees C in air. Auger electron spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that both surfaces had similar composition consisting of TiO2 covered by a carbonaceous surface contamination layer. The thickness of the oxide layer was 4 nm on the acid-oxidized surface and 39 nm on the annealed surface. Optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy showed that the acid-oxidized surface was rough and the annealed surface was smooth. The fibrinogen/prothrombin-thrombin ratio in the initial protein film differed between the surfaces. The number of adhering platelets was larger at the surface with a high surface concentration of adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet activation (CD62) and priming of PMNs (CD 11b) were also significantly higher on the acid-oxidized surface. The results indicate that non-self recognition of biomaterials is an array of transient reactions comprising protein-material, protein-cell, and cell-cell interactions.","CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT APPL PHYS, S-41296 GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN","Nygren, H (reprint author), UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, MED AREGATAN 5, S-41390 GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,44,69,70,0,9,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

The greatly reduced PCC of the hydrophilic variant might also suggest that hydrophilic variants of silicone would be more biocompatible than those currently used, The PCC of PEP for the IgGs was less than that of Imm 2 but still optimal at physiological conditions, Consistent with the data on Lf/Trf, PCC progressively decreased with increasing ionic strength at alkaline pH, Differences in pl between the protein pairs had only a marginal effect on the PCC of PEP, Monolayer adsorption on both PEP and Imm 2 was slowly reversible and greater in the presence of free ligand (<2% in 16 h) suggesting that the process follows Mass Law principles, However, even in the presence of non-ionic detergent and free ligand, 85-90% remained bound on either surface, Thus, desorption of proteins in the monolayer should not complicate subsequent immunochemical studies conducted on adsorbed monolayers.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity for titanium implant biomaterials could affect crevicular LPS concentrations and thereby influence periimplant inflammation. Purpose of study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli LPS affinity for titanium biomaterials groups that differed in surface oxide composition and surface roughness. Material and method. Polished and abraded grade 1 commercially pure titanium and grade 5 alloyed extra low interstitial titanium specimens were treated with 10 EU/mm(2) and radiolabeled LPS. Results. The resultant mean +/- SD LPS adherence values ranged from 4.17 +/- 0.29 to 4.79 +/- 0.40 EU/mm(2). No difference in adherence and elution was indicated on the basis of LPS type, surface oxide composition, or surface roughness. Moreover, P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS desorption was below detection. Conclusion. Clinically, the high affinity of both LPS types for titanium biomaterials may adversely influence the periimplant tissue response.","MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL & ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912","Nelson, SK (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,34,36,36,1,3,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-3913,,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

Experiments involved laser welding of elastin heterographs to the intimal surface of the carotid artery (in vitro, porcine) as a similar to 4x5 mm(2) spot weld, then determining the breaking strength when the two tissues were pulled in a direction parallel to the plane of the spot weld while submerged in water. The questions answered are: WHAT IS THE PEAK TEMPERATURE REQUIRED FOR WELDING ELASTIN HETEROGRAPH TO THE INTIMAL SURFACE OF CAROTID ARTERY? ANSWER: similar to 300 degrees C threshold, similar to 600 degrees C for maximum strength. This estimate is based on optical measurements of dye accumulation in stain laver and measurements of thickness of stain layer via fluorescence microscope examination. WHAT IS THE DEPENDENCE OF WELD STRENGTH ON THE LASER EXPOSURE? ANSWER: Breaking force (g) = Max*(1-exp(-(E-p-E-th)/U-67)), where Max is the maximum strength achievable by laser welding, expressed as the breaking force in g when elastin heterograph and tissue are pulled. E-p is the laser pulse energy. E-th is the apparent threshold laser pulse energy that will break the weld. U-67 is the laser energy above threshold which achieves 67% of Max. Max was about 15 g for the similar to 20 mm(2) weld area of our experiments. E-th was 0.8 J. U-67 was 1.44 J. DOES WELD STRENGTH DEPEND ON HYDRATION CONDITIONS? ANSWER: Not on the amount of excess unbound water. There was no significant difference in weld strength between welding dripping wet tissues vs well blotted tissues. WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN IRRADIATING THE WELD SURFACE THROUGH THE BIOMATERIAL VS THROUGH THE TISSUE, WHEN THE BIOMATERIAL IS PARTIALLY STAINED WITH ICG? ANSWER: There is a difference if the stain layer is heavily stained. Irradiation through the tissue allows direct irradiation on the weld surface which achieves the highest peak temperatures for the least laser pulse energy. irradiation through the elastin heterograph causes direct irradiation of the rear surface of the stain layer, within the biomaterial and away from the weld surface, and thermal diffusion must bring the heat to the weld surface. This difference occurs only when the absorption by the stain layer is sufficiently high that little laser energy directly reaches the weld surface.",,"Jacques, SL (reprint author), OREGON MED LASER CTR,PORTLAND,OR 97225, USA.",,,,,,,0,7,7,0,1,SPIE - INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010",,,0-8194-2386-6,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1997.0,2975,,,,,,54,61,,10.1117/12.275511,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Optics",Engineering; Optics,BJ12Q,WOS:A1997BJ12Q00006,,,,,2019-02-25

The blade profiles were chosen to show the effect of sharpness and to admit finite element simulation. The key computed quantity to be compared with experiments is the reaction force on the knife.

The applications of mu CT with respect to the analysis of bone are manyfold. Nevertheless, it also holds high promise for the microstructural measurement and analysis of porous biomaterials. For the purpose of the study, a desk-top mu CT providing a nominal isotropic resolution of 14 mu m was used. Since the polymeric material has a very low X-ray absorption coefficient, the scaffolds were stained prior to measurement using a commercial X-ray contrast agent. This allowed not only to acquire important microstructural features of the three-dimensional scaffold but also to compute standard structural indices such as BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp and the degree of anisotropy (DA) using mean intercept length measurements. The preliminary results show that different types of scaffolds can be distinguished both qualitatively (visualization) and quantitatively (morphometry) provided an adequate X-ray staining technique is used.

The results of these studies have shown that the wear factor is proportional to the counterface roughness raised to a power greater than one. In this laboratory study, the effect of surface finish of several biomaterials on the wear of UHMWPE was studied. The study was conducted using reciprocating pin-on-plate wear tests with bovine serum as a lubricant. The biomaterials investigated as the counterface material included stainless steel, cast cobalt chrome (CoCr), CoCr (ASTM F799), alumina ceramic and zirconia ceramic. The counterface topographies of the wear plates were produced using techniques representative of current manufacturing methods. The surface roughness of the wear plates was varied in the range R-a = 0.005-0.04 mu m; this was representative of femoral heads and femoral knee components currently used clinically. Metals and ceramics with a similar surface roughness produced a similar wear rate of UHMWPE. For the limited range of smooth counterfaces used in this study only a moderate correlation was found between the surface roughness and the wear factors. For a change in counterface roughness R-a of 0.005 to 0.04 mu m, the wear factor increased from 7.4 +/- 1.6 to 16.5 +/- 2.4 x 10(-9) mm(3)/N m (mean +/- standard error). This variation in counterface roughness had much less effect in wear than previously reported for rougher counterfaces. For an extended range of counterface roughness, a stronger correlation was found using an exponential function for the regression fit. The exponential function shows the benefits of decreased wear with decreased surface roughness. Although the wear rate decreased less rapidly with decreased counterface roughness for R-a values below 0.05 mu m, there were significant advantages to be gained from improved femoral head roughness to below 0.01 mu m R-a.",,"Lancaster, JG (reprint author), UNIV LEEDS,DEPT MECH ENGN,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,32,89,91,4,18,MECHANICAL ENG PUBL LTD,EDMUNDS,"PO BOX 24, NORTHGATE AVE, BURY ST, EDMUNDS, SUFFOLK, ENGLAND IP32 6BW",0954-4119,,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

The GAGs have been characterized in terms of total sulfate content and relative molecular weight. The amount of immobilized GAGs was 10(3) times higher than the theoretical amount for monomolecular side-to-side coordination on polymer surfaces. In a standardized perfusion system with shear rates of 1050 sec(-1), 37 degrees C, and 5 minutes with citrated blood, the level of platelet adhesion was 100% for partially cationized membrane, 90% for HA, 75% for each HE, CS, DS, KS, 5% for unmodified cellulose membrane, and 5% for confluent bovine aorta endothelial cells, referred to subendothelial matrix as standard for 100% platelet adhesion. ESHS-coated membranes were completely inert to platelets. The amount of ionically released GAGs during perfusion was also estimated. The partial cationic membrane is a suitable polymer surface in combination with the perfusion system to estimate the hemocompatibility of ionically immobilized water-soluble polyanions in terms of platelet adhesion at defined shear rates. The results of platelet adhesion are discussed in terms of structure and analytical parameter of the immobilized GAGs.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Klin Chem & Pathobiochem, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Kliniken Stadt Koln, Cologne, Germany","Baumann, H (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Klin Chem & Pathobiochem, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,64,14,14,0,3,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"333 SEVENTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10001 USA",0094-6176,1098-9064,,SEMIN THROMB HEMOST,Semin.

The coating is graded in accordance to adhesive strength and bioresorbability. The bond coat On the metal stub is deposited with a particle range of the hydroxyapatite materials that will provide a high adhesive strength and bioactivity but have poor bioresorption properties. The top coat however is composed of mainly alpha-tricalcium phosphate that is highly bioresorbable. This arrangement has the propensity of allowing accelerated bio-integration of the coating by the body tissues as the top layer is rapidly resorbed, leaving the more bioactive intermediate layer to facilitate the much needed bioactive properties for proper osteoconduction.

Patients: 40 patients had a polyurethane double-J ureteric stent inserted between June 1994 and March 1995, Group 1 comprised 22 stone farmers whose stents were placed in support of endourological treatment or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of renal or ureteric calculi. Group 2 comprised 18 patients whose stents were inserted for advanced and obstructive malignancy (n=8) of as an adjunct to reconstructive surgery or endourological techniques (n=10). After removal, stents were examined for encrustation and obstruction. A biochemical semiquantitative analysis was performed for deposits greater than or equal to 5 mg, and smaller sediments were examined with a polarizing optical microscope. Results: The incidence of encrustation was significantly higher (p=0.009) for stone formers. In addition, in this group indwelling times of encrusted and obstructed stents were significantly shorter (p=0.03 and 0.02, respectively), No particular relationship was found between the incidence of encrustation and indwelling times for stone formers. Conversely, for patients without urolithiasis, indwelling times were significantly longer for encrusted or obstructed stents than for unaffected ones (p=0.05 and 0.02, respectively), Biochemical and optical analyses of encrustations mainly revealed calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and ammonium magnesium phosphate. Calcium oxalate was the main crystalline phase, especially in the absence of urinary infection. Conclusion: Calcium oxalate represents the principal component of double-J ureteric stent encrustations. Thus, prophylaxis of encrustation may consist of preventive measures usually applied in cases of recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis.",,"Robert, M (reprint author), UNIV MONTPELLIER, HOP LAPEYRONIE, DEPT UROL, 371 AV DOYEN GASTON GIRAUD, F-34295 MONTPELLIER 5, FRANCE.",,,,,,,20,41,45,0,5,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0042-1138,1423-0399,,UROL INT,Urol.Int.,,1997.0,58,2,,,,,100,104,,10.1159/000282959,,,,5,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,WN831,WOS:A1997WN83100007,9096271.0,,,,2019-02-25

Surgical repair using different prosthetic biomaterials gains more and more acceptance. Therefore we wanted to evaluate our own results of hernia repair and anlayze the results of a mesh hernioplasty using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch (ePTFE). Patients and methods: 1. During the study period (1984-1992) a total of 205 hernia repairs (148 primary repairs, 57 repairs for recurrent hernia) were done in 173 patients at our institution using the following techniques: Mayo technique n = 90, simple one layer suture n = 56, absorbable mesh n = 25, ePTFE n = 17, other mesh techniques n = 17. In a retrospective study 135 of these patients (78 %) could be examined clinically The average follow up time was 44 months (10-105). 2. Since 1988 we used the ePTFE patch (Gore-tex Soft Tissue Patch) in selected cases for incisional hernia repair. In a second retrospective analysis the course of 26 patients, who were operated between 1988 and 1994, is reported. Results: 1. Local wound complications occurred in 3-6 % with conventional techniques and in 11-13 % after different types of mesh repair (n.s.). Overall recurrence rates were 30 % for primary hernia repair and 38 % for recurrent hernia repair without statistically different rates for the various techniques. The presence of two or more patient dependent risk factors (obesity, obstructive lung disease etc.) (p < 0.05) and hernia diameter > 5 cm (p < 0.05) were identified as risk factors for hernia recurrency. 2. In the ePTFE group one patient (4 %) developed a superficial wound complication, in another three patients (12 %) the patch had to be removed due to deep wound infections. All three patients had revealed septic wound complications after previous surgery. The recurrence rates (17 % for primary repair and 20 % for repeated repair) were clearly lower compared to conventional techniques. Conclusions: The use of prosthetic mesh should be considered for repair of large or recurrent incisional hernias, especially in high risk patients (obesity, obstructive lung disease). Beside the most often used polypropylene mesh, the ePTFE patch (Gore-tex-Soft-Tissue-Patch) represents a valuable alternative in selected cases with direct contact of the prosthesis to abdominal viscera, Any previous septic wound complication or a contaminated operating field (e.g. colostomy) seems to be a contraindication for its use.",,"Trupka, AW (reprint author), UNIV MUNICH,KLINIKUM INNENSTADT,CHIRURG KLIN & POLIKLIN,NUSSBAUMSTR 20,D-80336 MUNICH,GERMANY.",,,,,,,19,20,21,0,1,JOHANN AMBROSIUS BARTH VERLAG,HEIDELBERG,"IM WEIHER 10, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0044-409X,,,ZBL CHIR,Zent.bl.

The peptides and the fusion proteins have been partitioned in aqueous two-phase systems of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-dextran and Ucon-dextran. The studied model protein was ZZT0, where Z is an engineered domain of domain B of staphylococcal protein A. The specially designed hydrophobic peptides, Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro (T1) and (Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro), (T2), have been inserted into ZZT0, to give the peptide-protein fusions ZZT1 and ZZT2. In the experimental studies it was found that T1 and T2 preferred the PEG phase and even more the Ucon phase over the dextran phase. For T2 the partitioning was more one sided than for T1. For the fusion proteins, ZZT1 and ZZT2, the partitioning was enhanced into the PEG or Ucon rich phase as compared to ZZT0. The effects were lower than expected from independent contributions to the partition coefficient from the protein and the peptides. A heterogeneous lattice model was used to calculate theoretical peptide and protein partition coefficients. The calculations could reproduce the qualitative features of the experimental data. The model results suggest that a part of these experimentally observed effects is due to a depletion zone, i.e. a zone of reduced polymer concentration around the protein. The experimental results indicate a further reduction of the partition coefficient, beyond that predicted by the lattice calculations. A possible folding of the inserted peptide is discussed as a plausible mechanism for this further reduction in the partition coefficient.","LUND UNIV,DEPT BIOCHEM,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN; ROYAL INST TECHNOL,DEPT BIOCHEM & BIOTECHNOL,S-10044 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,34,24,24,4,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0021-9673,,,J CHROMATOGR A,J.

Contact of the patients' blood with the nonendothelial surface of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is responsible for several, potentially harmful systemic reactions. Methods. The patients' response to extracorporeal circulation is reviewed briefly. The interactions between patient and circuit are discussed not only as they relate to blood-material contact, but also from a mechanical and theologic standpoint The theoretic benefits of the newer, more hemocompatible materials are presented, along with a review of published clinical experience with heparinized cardiopulmonary bypass circuits. Results. The response to extracorporeal circulation extends far beyond a simple derangement of hemostasis. This inflammatory response is strongly influenced by the theologic design of the circuit and by the physical and chemical properties of the surface. Heparinized circuits decrease inflammation, but the clinical benefits of this reduction remain unclear, except for extended cardiopulmonary support. The safe use of these circuits requires full heparinization and does not reduce allogeneic transfusions. Conclusions. Clinicians are still in the search of the ideal material and the ideal extracorporeal circuit design. Newer, heparinized materials offer real but limited clinical benefits.","CHU BORDEAUX, INSERM U306, BIOMAT RES UNIT, BORDEAUX, FRANCE; CHU BORDEAUX, DEPT ANESTHESIA, BORDEAUX, FRANCE; UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT ANESTHESIA, MONTREAL HEART INST, MONTREAL, PQ, CANADA",,,,,,,,56,36,38,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0003-4975,1552-6259,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

The protein adsorption was studied by ellipsometry-antibody techniques in situ, and adhering platelets were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-CD 61 antibodies. Adhering platelets were quantified by counting labelled cells in microscopic image fields. The spreading of platelets was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that after 1 min of plasma exposure, fibrinogen, IgG and albumin were detectable with antibodies on both surfaces. The amount of deposited fibrinogen and complement decreased with time on titanium, and the amount of adsorbed anti-high molecular weight kininogen increased. No complement was detected on gold surfaces after plasma incubation, and the antibody binding pattern also remained unchanged after prolonged plasma exposure. The surface-bound platelets were found to spread on the gold but not on titanium surfaces. C1q has been shown to induce the expression of P-selectin, i.e. cause secretion reactions in platelets. In this study secreted platelet-microvesicles were found on gold, but not on the titanium surfaces that bound significant amounts of C1q. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that the mixture of fibrinogen, C1q and kininogens, whilst causing adhesion and aggregation, does not result in the activation and microvesicle secretion of platelets. Platelet activation on biomaterial surfaces thus seems to be governed by the mixture of proteins present on that surface, and no one particular protein need cause a known reaction in platelets as obtained when platelets are exposed only to that particular protein.

Ultrastructurally, the test material was circumscribed with an electron-dense structure, and was immediately adjacent to elongated cyoplasmic processes with intact morphology or collagen fibrils with periodic structures. Furthermore, the mineralization of the extracellular collagenous matrix occurred directly on the surface of the material.

Fresh and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries were used as controls. Both the epoxy-fixed and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries showed significant increases in fixation index and denaturation temperature as compared to the fresh one. Additionally, the resistance of porcine arteries against bacterial collagenase in vitro degradation increased significantly after cross-linking with the epoxy compound or glutaraldehyde. The reduction of the tensile strength of the epoxy-fixed artery after bacterial collagenase degradation was more severe than in its glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart. Generally, with increasing pH, temperature or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed porcine arteries increased. The results obtained in this study may be used to optimize the fixation process for developing a small-diameter biological vascular graft fixed by an epoxy compound.

We studied the behaviour of a new type of polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis used for the repair of abdominal wall defects, Dual Mesh(R) (DM), which has two different faces; one face has a porosity between 30 and 60 mu m, while the other is nonporous. In 20 New Zealand White rabbits, a full-thickness (except skin) 7 cm x 5 cm defect was created in the anterior abdominal wall that was repaired with DM. At 14, 30, 60 and 90 days, samples were obtained and studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. An immunohistochemical study was made with antibody anti-rabbit macrophages (RAM-11). Tensile strength was measured with an Instron tensiometer using 2-cm-wide strips obtained parallel to the shorter axis of the implant. DM induced little tissue adhesion to the material on the visceral peritoneum interface and was surrounded by organized repair tissue. The biomaterial was integrated in the repair tissue on the subcutaneous interface, but not on the peritoneal interface. The macrophage response decreased between days 14 and 90 (P < 0.001). Tensile strength increased significantly (P < 0.05) at every study period. We conclude that the DM prosthesis has little tendency to formation of visceral adhesions, the DM prosthesis was well tolerated by the receptor organism and the tensile strength of the prosthesis/receptor tissue interface increased with time.

The second part is focused on the synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural biopolymers used for these applications. The natural and semi-synthetic polymers discussed include cellulose-derivatives, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, chitosan, collagen and gelatin, among others. Poly(vinyl alcohol), different polyesters, poly(alkylcyano acrylate), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho esters) and alkyl half-esters of poly(vinyl ether/maleic anhydride) represent the most widely investigated biodegradable synthetic polymers for ocular applications.

Protein expression for collagen types I, III, and V, and for anti-human macrophages CD68 (DAKO-CD68, KP1) and CD68 (PG-M1), and anti-human myeloid/histiocyte antigen (DAKO-MAC 387) were determined immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibodies. At 24 and 48 h, levels of mRNA for alkaline phosphatase and osteonectin were greater than mRNA levels for osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen type I alpha 1, and collagen type I alpha 2 for cells grown on the three substrata. However, at 48 h mRNA levels for alkaline phosphatase and osteonectin were significantly higher on the modified ceramic substrata relative to the native alumina. HBD cells appear to express CD68-KP1 when cultured for 24 h. The techniques provide a sensitive and reproducible assay to evaluate gene and protein expression of cells grown on different substrata.

Experiments performed during both cooling and heating and with samples of different thermal histories show a broad endothermic feature beginning at ca. 160 K which is barely interrupted by a partial-crystallization exotherm at ca. 250 K. The endothermic features resembled those observed for several simpler hydrated proteins (Biophys. J., 1994, 66, 249; J. Phys. Chem., 1994, 98, 13780), a hydrated crosslinked polymer (J. Phys. Chem., 1990, 94 2689) and a dry interpenetrating network polymer blend (J. Polym. Sci. B, 1992, 32, 683). Their broadness is a result of the closely spaced multiplicity of small but sharp mini-endotherms and has its origin in the onset of different configurational substrates that become available to the protein's structure as the temperature is increased. The remarkable similarity of these features amongst a broad class of materials is a reflection of the predominant role of the intermolecular energy barriers in determining the structural relaxation kinetics. This has been described in terms of a time-dependent potential-energy surface, which represent a hierarchy of molecular and segmental motions. Ice and freeze-concentrated solution coexist at a thermodynamic equilibrium at T < 273 K. Their respective amounts have been measured between 260 and 273 K and formalism based on equilibrium thermodynamics has been developed, and the DSC scans for cooling simulated. This formalism agrees with the data. The temperature variation of the equilibrium constant for the protein-water <-> protein-ice coexistence does not agree with that given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which is a reflection of strong interactions between the water molecules and H-bonding protein segments. The interpretation in terms of the role of protein dynamics in the crystallization of water, and the formalism developed, are general and useful for studies on other complex biomaterials.",,"Johari, GP (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,HAMILTON,ON L8S 4L7,CANADA.",,,,,,,62,33,33,0,1,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK MILTON ROAD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4WF",0956-5000,,,J CHEM SOC FARADAY T,J.

Dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid, which is negatively charged at physiological conditions, was more easily transferred onto the solid substrate in the presence of divalent cations as compared to the zwitterionic phospholipids dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine and its ether analog dihexadecyl-phosphatidylcholine. The structure across the film was characterized by X-ray reflectivity and X-ray diffraction, whereas the in-plane structure was investigated by electron diffraction. X-ray experiments revealed a repeat unit of 5.35 nm for the LB him of phosphatidic acid. A model for the Y-type structure of this film is presented based on a modeling technique of the X-ray reflectivity data. The substructure of the film along the normal to the substrate plane is described in detail using this new approach. Electron diffraction indicated a hexagonal packing of the hydrocarbon chains normal to the substrate surface with a spacing of 0.425 nm. These parameters correlate well with data from bilayer structures. It can be supposed that LB films of acidic phospholipids are useful as membrane mimetic systems. Deposition of the zwitterionic phospholipids was of poor reproducibility, which could be improved in the presence of polymers. A spacing of about 7 nm was deduced for dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine films indicating that the polymer was transferred with the lipid onto the solid support.","RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,INST CRYSTALLOG,MOSCOW 117333,RUSSIA; ZELENOGRAD INST PHYS PROBLEMS,MOSCOW 103460,RUSSIA","Lohner, K (reprint author), AUSTRIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOPHYS & RONTGENSTRUKTURFORSCH,STEYRERGASSE 17-6,A-8010 GRAZ,AUSTRIA.",,"Konovalov, Oleg/C-6702-2019","Konovalov, Oleg/0000-0002-0390-5900",,,,38,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,NOV 15,1996.0,288,1-2,,,,,262,267,,10.1016/S0040-6090(96)08794-9,,,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,VZ205,WOS:A1996VZ20500050,,,,,2019-02-25

Two configurations to sense the binding of an antibody and a lectin to the complementary substrate monolayer are addressed. In one configuration, a fluorescein monolayer was assembled on an Au-electrode and binding of the complementary anti-fluorescein antibody Flc-Ab was followed by the examination of electrode insulation by the antibody towards a solubilized redox probe, Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-). The extent of electrode insulation is controlled by the Flc-Ab concentration in the sample and the electrode responds amperometrically to Flc-Ab concentrations as low as 0.7 mu M. The second configuration applies a redox-modified protein to analyze competitively the protein itself. An Au-electrode was modified by an alpha-D-mannopyranose monolayer, and a bipyridinium-modified concanavalin A was used to analyze concanavalin A (Con. A). Competitive binding of the redox-modified Con. A and the analyzed Con. A to the monolayer-modified electrode occurred, and the amperometric response was inversely proportional to the Con. A concentration. Quartz crystals coated with Au-electrodes were applied for the piezoelectric QCM analyses of Flc-Ab and Con. A. The crystal electrodes are modified with a fluorescein antigen monolayer. The Flc Ab was sensed by the changes in the crystal frequencies as a result of the antibody association to the electrode. Flc-Ab at a concentration as low as 5 ng ml(-1) was detected. The series of monosaccharides alpha-D-mannopyranose, beta-D-glucose or alpha-D-glucose was assembled onto the Au-electrodes of the quartz crystals and used as a sensing interface for concanavalin A.

However, essentially all previously examined topographies bear little relation to cell adhesion substrates found in biological tissues. In vivo, many cells are adherent to extracellular matrices (ECM), which have an extremely complex 3-D topography in the micrometre to nanometre range. In addition, many studies indicate that micro- and nano-scale mechanical stresses generated by cell-matrix adhesion have significant effects on cellular phenotypic behaviour. In this report we describe methodology for the fabrication of topographic replicas of the subendothelial ECM topography with a biomedical polyurethane. Using three-dimensional high resolution scanning electron microscopy, accurate replication of subendothelial ECM topography from the macroscopic to the macromolecular scale is demonstrated. Bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on the ECM replicas spread more rapidly and had a three-dimensional appearance and spread areas at confluence which appeared more like endothelial cells in native arteries, compared with cells cultured on untextured control surfaces. Since the fabrication process may be used with many different types of materials, including polymers of synthetic and biological origin, these biomimetic ECM-textured surfaces may find both research and clinical applications.

Amino acid analysis of the fresh porcine pericardium hybrid showed a reduction in lysine content after active isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomers exposure, indicating cross-linking between the polymer and tissue. Histological examination of the hybrid material shows a thin grey coating on both surfaces of the tissue, implying at least surface cross-linking oi the tissue with polyurethane.

In most instances, cells have sloughed off under flow conditions. The performance of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) designed to stabilize patients awaiting donor hearts for transplantation has been remarkably good. After prolonged implantation, pump surfaces become covered with a pannus of smooth muscle-like cells (myofibroblasts). Occasional islands of endothelial cells have been identified on top of such cell layers. Therefore, in an attempt to accelerate the beneficial conditioning and improve biomaterial-blood compatibility of LVAD internal surfaces, their seeding with autologous, genetically engineered smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was investigated. Methods and Results Since routine testing of the Thermo-cardiosystems HeartMate LVAD is carried out in calves, SMCs were isolated from calves, propagated in culture, and transduced with NO synthase genes to yield stable production of NO. Previous studies had demonstrated that SMCs attached strongly to the biomaterials that compose the internal surfaces of LVADs. Transduction of NO synthase gene expression in the SMCs was achieved by electroporation and antibiotic (G418) selection. Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by NO has been documented, and the same molecule has been shown to inhibit platelet adhesion to cell surfaces. Cells transduced with NO synthase expressed enzyme protein at consistently high levels for several passages in culture; however, NO production was dependent on the supplementation of culture medium with a source of tetrahydrobiopterin (sepiapterin). Under such conditions, transduced cells were growth-inhibited compared with mock-transfected controls. Induction of GTP cyclohydrolase (the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of tetrahydrobiopterin) expression also resulted in NO production by NO synthase-transduced cells. Conclusions Preliminary studies have shown that SMCs form strong attachments to the surface materials of LVADs and that their proliferation rates could be controlled after transformation with NO synthase under conditions that support production of NO. Therefore, genetically engineered SMCs may provide an improved blood-biomaterial interface for cardiovascular prostheses.",,"ScottBurden, T (reprint author), TEXAS MED CTR,TEXAS HEART INST,VASC CELL BIOL LAB,POB 20345,HOUSTON,TX 77225, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-53233],,,13,13,13,0,0,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,NOV 1,1996.0,94,9,,S,,,235,238,,,,,,4,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,VP690,WOS:A1996VP69000043,8901752.0,,,,2019-02-25

The authors evaluate whether dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DSA) is a reliable method to determine the density of natural coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) blocks used as bone graft substitutes. METHODS. To evaluate the basic density of HA blocks from the same coral heads with and without titanium meshes, densitometry of 12 HA-500 blocks (genus Goniopora) and 12 HA-200 blocks (genus Porites) was performed. In addition, density measurements of 30 HA blocks (HA-500, n = 15; HA-200, n = 15) from different coral heads were obtained to assess if the originating coral head influences the basic density of blocks within one coral genera. To assess standard deviation serial measurements on eight coralline HA blocks, four with titanium meshes and four without were performed. In the ex vivo study, densitometry of 12 HA blocks (HA-500, n = 4; HA-200, n = 8) used as bone graft substitutes in the mandibles and craniums of adult mongrel dogs was performed. Densities were measured after bone in growth for 2 and 4 months, respectively. All measurements were obtained with a Lunar DPX with scan mode ''slow 750'' in the spine program with the regions-of-interests selected manually. Bone ingrowth was assessed by computer-assisted histomorphometry, which was considered the gold standard. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate the densities of plain HA blocks with and without meshes to the specific weights of the blocks. RESULTS. Significant positive correlation was found between the density of each HA block (both coral species) with and without meshes and the calculated specific weights. Densitometry values showed no significant differences depending on the originating coral heads. Standard deviation ranged between +/-3.8% and +/-4.1% (HA-500) and between +/-3.0% and +/-3.8% (HA-200). Hydroxyapatite-500 blocks showed marked increased densities between 15% and 34% after 4 months in three specimens in which bone ingrowth between 16.9% and 21.1% was revealed by histomorphometry; no increase of density was observed in one specimen, which presented only minimal bone ingrowth and signs of infection. Despite bone invasion between 12% and 25.8%, no increased densities were observed for HA-200 implants. CONCLUSIONS. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is an accurate and reproducible modality to assess the densities of plain coralline HA blocks and to monitor bone ingrowth into coralline HA-500 but not into HA-200 block implants.","VET AFFAIRS MED CTR,DEPT RADIOL,SAN DIEGO,CA 92161; UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SAN DIEGO,CA 92103; UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT PLAST SURG,SAN DIEGO,CA 92103; INTERPORE INT INC,IRWINE,CA",,,,,,,,16,8,8,0,1,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0020-9996,,,INVEST RADIOL,Invest.

The present study has demonstrated that the Fluoropassiv(R) mesh provides adequate mechanical strength and compares favorably with the two controls. No exacerbated systemic or in situ hematologic or immunological reactions were observed with either the meshes or the patch material.

After 4 days, 1 month, and 3 months postimplantation, the tissue reactions and interactions were evaluated by light micros copy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Poly(tetrahydrofuran) (poly(THF)), poly(propylene oxide) (poly(POx)), and poly(tetrahydrofuran-co-oxetane) (poly (THF-co-OX)) were tested as relatively hydrophobic polyethers, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) and a poly(THF)/PEO blend were used as more hydrophilic materials. In general all polyethers showed good biocompatibility with respect to tissue reactions and interactions, with low neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, a quiet giant cell reaction, and formation of a thin fibrous capsule. For the relatively hydrophobic polyethers studied, the biostability increased in the order poly(POx) < poly(THF-co-OX) < poly(THF), probably indicating that the absence of tertiary hydrogen atoms has a positive effect on the biostability. Concerning the more hydrophilic materials, crosslinked PEO showed the highest rate of degradation, probably due to the mechanical weakness of the hydrogel in combination with the highest presence of giant cells as a result of the high porosity. A frayed surface morphology was observed after implantation of the crosslinked poly(THF)/PEO blend, which might be due to preferential degradation of PEO domains.

The HCLs used were 1) PMMA HCL, 2) oxygen-permeable HCL composed of a graft copolymer of dextran derivative and methylmethacrylate (MMA) (Suncon Mild II(TM), 12 Dk), and 3) oxygen-permeable-HCL composed of a copolymer of a monomer containing silicone, a monomer containing fluorine, and MMA (RGPL-A, 216 Dk). Cell injury rates were significantly different among these HCLs (Suncon Mild II(TM) < PMMA < RGPL-A) although there were no differences in rotatory rubbing forces. The smoothness of HCL surface, the qualities of injured cell layers observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the water wettability of HCLs were not correlated with cell injury rate. These results suggest that physicochemical properties of materials other than rotatory rubbing force, smoothness, and water wettability were involved in the cell injury. Our evaluation method for biomaterials that injure the corneal endothelial cells by dynamic contact should be very useful for the development of biomaterials or medical devices, including HCLs and intracardiac and urethral catheters.

Furthermore it was found that the terpolymer is markedly radiopaque: even thin objects (<0.5 mm) could be easily visualized using X-ray fluoroscopic techniques as are routinely used in the clinic, e.g., during coronary angiography. The combined results obtained with the present terpolymer (particularly its in vitro hemocompatibility and its radiopacity) leads to the suggestion that this type of polymer could be used as cardiovascular biomaterials, for instance for the construction of a new type of endovascular stents. These would be expected to show improved biocompatibility if compared with metallic stents which are currently used, for instance in conjunction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). A stent prototype, constructed from the present radiopaque terpolymer, is shown and discussed briefly. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons.

The symposium examined issues relating to the biocompatibility and clinical role of alloplastic materials commonly used for facial bone and soft-tissue replacement and augmentation, It provided a forum for the interaction of basic scientists, clinicians, and manufacturers. Clinical and laboratory data concerning a variety of implantable materials were presented and discussed. The program consisted of three parts. The first session was designed to provide historical and scientific background as well as perspective on legal issues surrounding the use of implantable biomaterials. The second session involved the presentation of clinical data on bone and bone substitutes for augmentation of the facial skeleton. The third session was devoted to clinical reports of bone and bone substitutes used for the reconstruction of cranial vault and cranial base skull defects.","MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP,DIV PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02114; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA; GEORGETOWN UNIV,MED CTR,DIV PLAST SURG,WASHINGTON,DC 20057",,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,0,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

The experimental difficulties associated with the application of this technique to the study of biological materials include the effects of ultra-high vacuum, x-ray exposure, surface charging, and, for insulating materials, the inherent lack of an intrinsic energy reference. Since most biological materials are insulators, the lack of an intrinsic energy reference complicates one's ability to draw direct comparisons between different studies. In this paper, the results from two different apatites are compared with the results obtained from the use of two conventional techniques for referencing binding energies. The results presented here are referenced only to the Pt Fermi level; no further energy modifications are performed. A comparison with the results of other investigators indicates a large difference in binding energies for all involved core levels. These results indicate that, in the study of insulating materials with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is essential that all data be acquired under exacting conditions on the same experimental system.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH DENT,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108; NYU,DENT CTR,NEW YORK,NY 10010","Wieliczka, DM (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT PHYS,1110 EAST 48TH ST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64110, USA.",,,"Spencer, Paulette/0000-0003-1447-826X","NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09696, DE00260]",,,7,10,10,0,4,AMER ASSOC DENTAL RESEARCH,ALEXANDRIA,"1619 DUKE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314",0022-0345,,,J DENT RES,J.

The purpose of this study was to test percutaneous injectable bone biomaterials with a reproducible model. A closed cancellous bone defect was created in the distal femoral extremities of 34 rabbits. Filling was done by a percutaneous injection made on the medial side, after the defect had been hollowed by a lateral approach. Three situations were tested: unfilled, filled with orthopaedic cement, filled with a soft collagen-hydroxyapatite material. Three time intervals (2, 4 and 8 weeks) were tested for the three situations. For the mixed hydroxyapatite-collagen material, each component was tested separately: the injectable collagen, and the hydroxyapatite powder. The quality of the defect was assessed by the variations of the defect area on sagittal sections. Bone formation in the defect was quantified for each group and time interval. A bone defect of reproducible size was obtained. Evolution of bone formation was different in each group. An unfilled defect was never completely filled by bone and the defect bone formation rate stayed between 9.9% and 15.1% without any statistical difference between the time intervals. The percutaneous injection of orthopaedic cement, which was progressive, was less complete than an opened surgical filling and explained a frequent low peripheral bone formation. A lower bone formation rate was observed in all the filled groups (orthopaedic cement, hydroxyapatite-collagen, hydroxyapatite and collagen) than in the control unfilled group. This study showed the use of bone biomaterials by an injectable percutaneous method, and a model to evaluate these materials is proposed.","CTR HOSP VICTOR PROVO,F-79100 ROUBAIX,FRANCE","Pasquier, G (reprint author), INST CALOT,INST RECH MALAD SQUELETTE,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE.",,,"Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,17,39,39,0,4,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

This study analyzed effects of surface finish and diamond-like carbon coating on osteoblast cell adhesion to polished titanium-aluminum-vanadium and polished or grit-blasted cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys. Osteoblast binding was tested in the presence and absence of the cell adhesion proteins fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin and was quantified by measurement of DNA content. Although adherence occurred in serum-free medium, maximal osteoblast binding required serum and was similar for titanium and cobalt alloys at 2 and 12 hours. With the grit-blasted cobalt alloy, cell binding was reduced 48% (p < 0.05) by 24 hours. Coating the alloys with diamond-like carbon did not alter osteoblast adhesion, whereas fibronectin pretreatment increased cell binding 2.6-fold (p < 0.05). In contrast, fibrinogen, vitronectin: and laminin did not enhance cell adhesion. These results support the hypothesis that cell adhesion proteins can modify cell binding to orthopaedic alloys. Although osteoblast binding was not affected by the presence of diamond-like carbon, this coating substance may influence other longer term processes, such as bone formation, and deserves further study.","STANFORD UNIV,MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT FUNCT RESTORAT,ORTHOPAED RES LAB,STANFORD,CA 94305; STANFORD UNIV,SCH ENGN,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305; WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ST LOUIS,MO",,,,,,,,40,41,43,1,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Disadvantages are high rates of local wound complications and restriction of mobility by the rigid ''shell''.

The initial textile testing reveals relevant differences in structure with marked asymmetry in the different directions. The materials are implanted as inlay in rats for 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days. The deformation of the abdominal wall following intraabdominal pressure of 0-70 mmHg (0-9.81 kPa) is documented by 3D-photogrammetry, the tensile strength by tearing of excised strips of mesh. Three commercial available materials and two laboratory modifications lead independently of their textile characteristics to a marked restriction of the rounded configuration of the abdominal wall. The tensile strength exceeds by far the physiologically necessary value of 16 N/cm. Three newly developed meshes made of multifilament polypropylene with reduced amounts of material (21% and 28% relative to Marlex(R)) lead to no restriction of the abdominal wall configuration yet have uncompromised stability.

The resultant coatings were characterised using electron microscopical and X-ray diffraction techniques. The mechanical properties were tested using a microhardness indentation technique, the results from which were used to give some indication of the strength and adhesion of the coatings. A model has been proposed to explain the observed phenomena in the precipitation and deposition processes. Amorphous calcium phosphate forms initially in the form of spheres. These spheres coalesce to form gel-like sheets in which hydroxyapatite nucleates. The gel sheets are attracted electrophoretically to the cathode where they are deposited as cells.

We are using this method of surface modification in our search for artificial surfaces with optimized blood compatibility. As a part of this work, two pivotal questions are now addressed: (i) what is the surface density of coupled molecules that can be reached by this method and (ii) is binding to the surface really covalent? After the photochemical coupling of 2 to a PEU surface, the ester bonds of the coupled molecules were selectively hydrolyzed with 0.1 M NaOMe/MeOH and the concentration of fluorescent molecules in solution determined spectrofluorometrically. Since not all of the fluorescent molecules were removed by this procedure, an additional experiment was performed (in which the polymer was completely dissolved). It was found that 25 nmol/cm(2) had coupled to the outermost polymer layers and 7.7 nmol/cm(2) to polymer layers more within the material (unreachable for the NaOMe/MeOH reagent). In another experiment a modified PEU sheet was dissolved in THF, after which MeOH was added to precipitate it again. From the fact that no fluorescence was detected in solution it could be concluded that all of the fluorescent molecules were indeed covalently coupled to the polymer surface.","MAASTRICHT UNIV,CTR BIOMAT RES,NL-6200 MD MAASTRICHT,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,28,14,14,1,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,OCT 21,1996.0,29,22,,,,,7012,7015,,10.1021/ma960279x,,,,4,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,VN888,WOS:A1996VN88800007,,,,,2019-02-25

The results of our investigation suggest that two-phase aqueous micellar systems of the type examined in this article are indeed potentially useful as extractant phases for the separation or concentration of proteins and other biomaterials.

Explants surrounded by tissue are often fixed in formalin or glutaraldehyde to facilitate later pathological and histological analysis, but the subsequent removal of such fixed tissue from thermally sensitive and less chemically stable polymers, such as polyurethanes, poses major problems for the materials scientist, who does not wish to modify the chemical, physical or morphological characteristics of the underlying biomaterial. The present study has attempted to find a solution to this problem by exposing virgin specimens of the microporous polyurethane Vascugraft(R) vascular prosthesis to six different cleaning conditions, all known to be effective in removing fixed tissue. These conditions included the use of 20% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution for 48 h at room temperature, 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for 5 min at the boil, and 9, 10, 11 and 12 N hydrochloric acid for 48 h at room temperature. The appearance and chemical properties of the virgin and treated specimens were compared using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography for molecular weight and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. The use of temperatures close to the boil resulted in the formation of a translucent, rubbery material with gross changes in the microporous and microfibrous structure. The strongly acidic and alkaline conditions caused a loss in the surface carbonate group content. In addition, 12 N hydrochloric acid reduced the molecular weight and urethane content. Consequently, 9 N hydrochloric acid is recommended as the cleaning agent of choice for removing fixed tissue from this type of microporous polyurethane. Control experiments on virgin material should also be included in any cleaning protocol.

We have demonstrated that the rate of cross-linking in glutaraldehyde and epoxide homobifunctional reagents can be modulated by uniaxial stress (strain). Two poly(glycidyl ether) epoxides were used: Denacol(R) EX-810 (a small bifunctional reagent), and Denacol EX-512 (a large polyfunctional reagent). To prevent any possible effect from being masked by saturation of cross-linking sites, bovine pericardium was cross-linked to such an extent that the increase in collagen denaturation temperature, T-d, was one-half of the maximal rise achievable with each reagent. Uniaxial tensile stress of 0, 15, 124 or 233 kPa was applied during cross-linking. Cross-linking rate (as observed by increase in T-d) increased with increasing stress to a maximum at 124 kPa in glutaraldehyde at pH 7 but decreased in EX-810 at pH 7. In each case, the effect was small but statistically significant. No effect was observed with the larger EX-512. Cross-linking under increasing stress also showed systematic effects on mechanical properties: decreasing extensibility and plastic strain while increasing tensile strength. In each case, the effects of the epoxides were slightly different from those of glutaraldehyde. In preparation for the above experiments, studies of the effect of pH, temperature, and exposure time were carried out for each epoxide and (to a lesser extent) for glutaraldehyde. Again, systematic changes in mechanical properties were observed with increasing T-d. Conformational changes in collagen produced by mechanical stress (strain) modulate the rate of cross-linking and the resulting mechanical properties; however, the effects are sensitive to the reagent employed.

The results indicate that the tissue's shrinkage temperature behaviour is retained. The tissues do not appear to have been affected by surface layering with polypyrrole or poly(sodium 3-pyrrolyl-butanesulphonate) (PSPBS). The main influence on the shrinkage temperature appears to be the reaction conditions in producing the hybrids i.e. the solvent and the presence of FeCl3. Hybrids obtained from reactions where the solvent was acetic acid demonstrated irreversible denaturation giving a final lower shrinkage temperature than the original value. Ail tissues exposed to FeCl3 were found to have higher shrinkage temperatures. This has been attributed to transient coordination bonding between the metal ion and side groups on the amino acid. The single peak of PSPBS-tissue hybrids in acetic acid is probably associated with the effective penetration of the PSPBS into the tissue, permitting some interaction between the functionalities of the conducting polymer and collagen.

In the case of the agar diffusion test survival of cells is involved in the presence of the material to be tested. Further statements on the biological effects of a biomaterial require the use of cell cultures adapted to the tissue concerned and the underlying problem being investigated. In the present study, an osteoblast cell culture system with which implant surfaces in contact with bone can be tested as required by the relevant standards is described. Test bodies made of titanium, polystyrene or copper were used in the conventional agar diffusion test, and were also overgrown with fibroblasts or a cell line of foetal human osteoblasts. For the agar diffusion test, the test criterion was the extent of the inhibition area on staining with neutral red, while for the overgrowth, the mean cell diameter and the number of cells was employed. The phenotype of the osteoblast cell line was determined immunohistochemically by means of alkali ne phosphatase or immunohistologically by means of collagen I and osteocalcin. Calcification was demonstrated using the v. Kossa stain. In the case of the osteoblasts, a differentiation of a collagen I and alkaline phosphatase-positive phenotype over an osteocalcin-positive phenotype to an increase in calcium deposition was shown. As in the case of the agar diffusion test, direct overgrowth also revealed no cytotoxic effect for titanium and polystyrene. In contrast, a cytotoxic effect consisting in a decrease in the number of cells and also a left shift in the size distribution was observed for copper. The standard deviations of the individual tests were less for overgrowth than for the agar diffusion test. The culture system for osteoblast cells thus meets the criteria of the EN/DIN 30993-5 in terms of the quality and accuracy of the results obtained. In addition to excluding direct cytotoxicity, this test system offers a new possibility of examining the influence of the material on cell growth. Consequently, it permits a repeatable examination of proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts on each material surface.","UNIV WURZBURG,LEHRSTUHL EXPT ZAHNMED,WURZBURG,GERMANY","Hendrich, C (reprint author), UNIV WURZBURG,ORTHOPAD KLIN,KONIG LUDWIG HAUS,BRETTREICHSTR 11,D-97074 WURZBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,,,15,11,11,0,5,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

We and others have provided evidence that direct interaction, an interaction that we believe is essential for the stabilization, between the sugar and polar groups in, for example, proteins and phospholipids occurs in the dry state. Some researchers, however, have suggested that the ability of the sugar to form a glass is the only requirement for stabilization. More recently, we have shown that both glass formation and direct interaction of the sugar and headgroup are often required for stabilization. In the present study, we present a state diagram for trehalose glass and suggest that the efficacy of this sugar for stabilization may be related to its higher glass transition temperatures at all water contents. We also show that trehalose and trehalose:liposome preparations form trehalose dihydrate as well as trehalose glass when rehydrated with water vapor. Formation of the dihydrate sequesters water, which might otherwise participate in lowering the glass transition temperature to below ambient. Because samples remain in the glassy state at ambient temperatures, viscosity is high and fusion between liposomes is prevented.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT FOOD SCI & TECHNOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","Crowe, LM (reprint author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,SECT MOL & CELL BIOL,STORER HALL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,33,405,420,0,77,BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Bacterial biofilms were produced in the modified Bobbins device using continuous culture flow at 60 ml/h for 40-44 h, and the sessile organisms were then exposed to either ciprofloxacin or tobramycin at a range of concentrations for 12 or 36h. The BEC of ciprofloxacin was 5 mu g/ml for the 12 and 36 h treatments, a value 10 x greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). In contrast, the BEC of tobramycin was >100 mu g/ml after 12h and 75 mu g/ml following 36 h of drug exposure, that is 75-100 x the MIC and MBC. The results demonstrated that the BEC is a more suitable indicator of the antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms than the MIC and MBC. Ciprofloxacin was significantly more effective than tqbramycin in the treatment of P. aeruginosa adherent to biomaterials. With respect to clinical application, if the intention of antibiotic use is to eradicate bacteria adherent to devices, only biofilm-active agents should be used.

This approach may be useful for enhancing the fixation of orthopedic implants. p-Nitrophenyl chloroformate (p-NPC) was used to immobilize protein on bulk samples of Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. Activation of both materials was dependent on the concentration of p-NPC, with a maximum of approximately 1.5 active groups/nm(2) of nominal surface area. Trypsin was used as a model protein because much is known about its structure and mode of action. Derivatization with 0.65 mg p-NPC/cm(2) resulted in significantly greater enzymatic activity (7.4 BAEE [N-(alpha)-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester hydrochloride] units) on the Co-Cr-Mo samples compared with higher concentrations of p-NPC (5 BAEE units) and with simple adsorption of trypsin (1.5 BAEE units). An activity of 10.5 BAEE units was measured on both adsorbed and p-NPC-activated Ti-6Al-4V, with the exception of samples derivatized with 1.95 mg p-NPC/cm(2), on which activity was significantly lower (4 BAEE units). In probing the linkages between trypsin and biomaterial by treatment with chaotropic agents, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was observed to eliminate more enzymatic activity than was urea. On Co-Cr-Mo samples, GuHCl removed nearly all the trypsin activity, while urea significantly decreased the activity only at a concentration of 0.65 mg r-NPC/cm(2). Treatment of Ti-6Al-4V samples with GuHCl caused a trend of decreasing activity with increasing concentration of p-NPC, whereas urea had no effect on immobilized trypsin activity.

The immunostaining method developed seemed to be a reliable technique to stain proteins in undecalcified sections. Biocompatibility results of the NiTi screws compared with the other screws showed a slower osteogenesis process characterized by no close contact between implant and bone, disorganized migration of osteoblasts around the implant, and a lower activity of osteonectin synthesis.

The morphological study revealed a diversity of structures having a minimal relative porosity of 70%, high bursting, and suture retention strengths in comparison with natural muscular tissue. Elasticmoduli proved to depend more on the direction of the textile: the rigidity was higher for those materials having tight structure, like the Fluoropassiv(R) and the Surgipro(TM) meshes (>30 MPa), whereas those with more open structures, such as the Marlex(R), Trelex(R), Lars(R), Bard Teflon(R), and GoreTex(R) structures, showed lower elastic modulus (10 mPa). In addition, chemical analyses confirmed no irregularities in the polymers used in all prostheses and demonstrated that the fluoropolymer coating of the Fluoropassiv(R) was uniformly distributed. The innovative aspects in the construction of the knitted fabric Fluoropassiv(R) appears to make it suitable for repairing hernias, and the inclusion of both continuous fluoropolymer surface treatment of polyester fibers and gelatin impregnation appears to improve the healing process.

All of the assays investigated showed a highly significant ''edge'' effect when within-plate reproducibility was examined; between-plate reproducibility was good for all assays except the MTT assay. When the assays were tested on cells adherent on biomaterials, there was a wide variation in the results obtained; in particular, the MTS assay showed poor reproducibility in the presence of materials. The MTT and BrdU assays both showed sufficient precision to detect cells on two of the materials studied. The study demonstrates that colorimetric assays are potentially useful in biocompatibility assessment but must be fully validated for the application chosen.","INTERDISCIPLINARY RES CTR BIOMED MAT,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND; QUEENS MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT HUMAN MORPHOL,NOTTINGHAM NG7 2UH,ENGLAND","Clifford, CJ (reprint author), INST ORTHOPAED,BROCKLEY HILL,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,29,24,26,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Three surfaces known to be difficult to evaluate were chosen to be measured on the same area with the two instruments. The measurements from the optical and the contact stylus profilometer were compared with each other and with measurements obtained from high-resolution atomic force microscopy, which served as a reference instrument. Six implants manufactured from commonly used biomaterials were also measured on the same part of the implant, but not on the same area, with the optical and the contact profilometer in order to stimulate the measurements that would be performed wizen different laboratories measure similarly treated surfaces. The numerical and visual differences achieved when measuring the same area with the two instruments investigated were compared. In general, we found an underestimation of the surface features with the contact stylus measurement and an overestimation with the confocal scanner The stylus readings are mainly influenced by the radius of the stylus tip, the pressure of the stylus tip on the surface, and the hardness of the material the optical profilometer has a tendency for creating spikes when surfaces with deep slopes are measured. For relatively soft metallic biomaterials, we found that using the optical instrument is the most appropriate method for surface roughness characterization, particularly when screw-shaped implants are analysed, whereas the stylus is preferred when larger areas with substantial slopes within the surface structure are to be evaluated.

Different types of samples were produced by conventional and shear-controlled injection molding (Scorin) and tested under tensile and impact loading. The behavior of three distinct grades is discussed in terms of the respective fracture morphology (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy). A comparison is made between the behavior of conventional and Scorim samples. The results show that the mechanical properties of the materials used were significantly improved by the employment of the Scorim process. The stiffness values of the conventional moldings were doubled, without reducing the ductility of the polymer. The impact data showed a material sensitivity, and consequent loss of properties, to the localized shear imposed to the melt during processing. This situation is attributed to very narrow mold gates (in the case of pingated systems) and leads to much reduced impact performance.","FEUP, DEPT MET ENGN, P-4099 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; INST BIOMED ENGN, INEB, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO, DEPT POLYMER ENGN, P-4800 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL; BRUNEL UNIV, WOLFSON CTR MAT PROC, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND",,,"Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008; Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012","Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Cunha M., Antonio/0000-0003-3860-7732",,,,13,64,66,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1042-7147,,,POLYM ADVAN TECHNOL,Polym.

However, the mechanism of this in vivo platelet adhesion has yet to be studied extensively. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a practical assay method for assessing platelet adhesion under flow conditions. We have devised an assay method (the fluorescent adhesion assay) that is based on the technique originally reported by Hubbell and McIntire (Biomaterials 7:354, 1986) with some modifications to make it more amenable for assaying small samples and have developed an analysis method to quantify the extent of platelet adhesion and aggregation from fluorescence images by using a computer-assisted image analysis system. In our assay, platelet adhesion, expressed as the percentage of the area covered by adhered platelets, was found to increase biphasically as a function of time. In the first phase, platelets interacted with the coated collagen, transiently stopping on the surface; we called this reaction the temporary arrest. In the second phase. platelets adhered much more rapidly and permanently on the surface, and this adhesion was dependent on the shear rate; platelets formed aggregates in this phase. We used our assay to analyze the effects of platelet aggregation inhibitors on platelet adhesion. All three examined inhibitors, EDTA (10 mmol/L), antiglycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, and GRGDS peptide (1 mmol/L), inhibited the second phase adhesion in flowing blood. Furthermore, GPVI-deficient platelets also showed defective second-phase adhesion under the same conditions. These results suggested that GPIIb/IIIa activation and GPVI contribute to the reaction inducing the second phase. The second-phase adhesion has been extensively investigated, and the consensus is that this reaction is mainly attributable to the platelet-platelet interaction. In this report, we were able to detect an earlier reaction, the temporary arrest. This temporary arrest would reflect the fast and weak interaction between platelet GPIb/IX and collagen-von Willebrand factor complexes on the collagen-coated surface.

This study was conducted to investigate the impact of the preservation method of bioprosthetic heart valve materials on calcification rates and biocompatibility of the biologic tissue. Methods. In subcutaneous rat implants, conventionally preserved bioprosthetic heart valve material was compared with bovine pericardium that was treated with L-glutamic acid to reduce residual glutaraldehyde released from the fixed tissue. Both these methods were compared with bovine pericardium that was stabilized by a dye-mediated photooxidation reaction without glutaraldehyde. Biocompatibility of these biomaterials was tested in vitro using human endothelial cell cultures. Results. Conventionally preserved bovine pericardium with a high amount of glutaraldehyde incorporated into the tissue resulted in severe calcification 63 days after subcutaneous implantation in rats (165.4 +/- 20 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). postfixation treatment with L-glutamic acid, which reduces free, unbound aldehyde groups, showed a significant decrease in calcification (89.6 +/- 14 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). Glutaraldehyde-free preservation by dye-mediated photooxidation showed no calcification after 63 days of subcutaneous implantation (1.0 +/- 0.4 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). Regular endothelial cell proliferation was observed on photooxidized and L-glutamic acid-treated tissue, whereas conventionally treated tissue caused endothelial cell death. Conclusions. This study underlines the detrimental role of glutaraldehyde in the calcification process of bioprosthetic heart valve materials and emphasizes alternative preservation methods that reduce or avoid the use of glutaraldehyde.","UNIV VIENNA,ZENTRUM BIOMED FORSCH,VIENNA,AUSTRIA; VET UNIV VIENNA,INST HISTOL & EMBRYOL,A-1030 VIENNA,AUSTRIA","Grabenwoger, M (reprint author), UNIV VIENNA,DEPT CARDIOTHORAC SURG,WAHRINGER GURTEL 18-20,A-1090 VIENNA,AUSTRIA.",,,"Windberger, Ursula/0000-0002-5800-9089",,,,22,56,60,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0003-4975,,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

Patency was assessed macroscopically, and the grafts were examined microscopically. The anti thrombogenicity of the vascular prostheses heparinized by thermal cross-linking was good in comparison with that of the control group. However, on the outer surface of the grafts, the author found more infiltration of fibroblasts into the wall of the control grafts than in the heparinized grafts. The author surmised that heparinized gelatin injected into the interfibril space of the graft inhibited cellular infiltration. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was slight in both grafts. Thus, the author was successful in heparinizing the vascular prostheses by thermal cross-linking and obtaining slow release of heparin to maintain early antithrombogenicity.

A lysosomal marker was used to assess the incidence of infiltrating extracellular matrix degrading cells. The major biochemical features that were associated with tissue degeneration and bioprosthetic heart valve failure were increased levels of MMP 9, high levels of beta-glucuronidase, and constant levels of active collagenase and MMP 2. The MMPs extracted from ruptured bioprostheses were inhibited by calcium chelators and zinc binding compounds.

The release from the implants and the tissue distribution of implanted GFs were determined in vivo using radiolabelled FGF-2. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of capillaries present in each Dacron(R) histological serial section. Radiolabelled GF was rapidly released from matrices and was absent from them by day 28. A very low percentage of the implanted radiolabelled GFs was found in the kidneys and livers of the animals. The number of microvessels formed within fibrin-impregnated samples was increased in the presence of HA and EGGS at 14d and of FN and EGGS or FGF-2 at 28d. FGF-1 had no direct effect on angiogenesis in our model. These results indicate that. enhancement of vascularization within prosthesis mesh may be achieved by using fibrin as a support for angiogenic molecules such as HA, FN and FGFs.

Stents find clinical use in interventional cardiology, in conjunction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). It is put forward that the stent prototype presented herein has, at least in principle, some advantages over existing (metallic) stents; these advantages are primarily owing to the unique combination of X-ray visibility and haemocompatibility which is presently achieved.

Previous studies have shown that biomaterials can activate macrophages to produce cytokines and promote an inflammatory response. Although the toxicity of many metal ions has been extensively investigated, little is known about the ability of these ions to alter cytokine release from macrophages. Yet the release of these ions from biomaterials has been well documented. Previous studies indicated that alterations in cytokine release might be expected because metal ions alter protein production in macrophages at sub-toxic concentrations. Thus, the hypothesis of this study was that metal ions can alter the secretion of cytokines from macrophages at sub-toxic concentrations. Methods. The release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from macrophages was investigated when the macrophages were exposed to metal ions, with or without lipopolysac charide (LPS), a component of dental plaque. Human THP-1 macrophages were exposed to ions of Ag, Au, Cu, Hg, and Ni for 24 h. In half of the cultures, LPS was added for the last 4 h. The release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha into the medium was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison intervals were used to compare the various experimental conditions. Results. None of the metal ions elevated the IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha levels after 24 h, but Ni ions significantly elevated the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels after 72 h. With LPS added, Ag, Cu, and Ni significantly amplified the LPS-induced production of IL-1 beta but only Ni amplified the TNF-alpha response. These alterations in cytokine response occurred with metal ion concentrations which have been previously shown to be released from dental alloys in vitro and in vivo. Significance. it appeared plausible that macrophage-cytokine mediated inflammatory responses may be altered by the presence of some metal ions in tissues, particularly Ni.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL SURG & MED,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","Wataha, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,35,50,53,0,4,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

Our approach makes use of the McMillan-Mayer solution theory to construct a Gibbs free energy model of the solution. This approach has the following desirable features: (i) the molecular structures of the solute species as well as their interactions are explicit inputs, and, therefore, the application of the theory is not restricted to a particular system, and (ii) the accuracy of the theory can be systematically improved, since the various approximations involved in constructing the solution Gibbs free energy model are clearly delineated. We illustrate the practical implementation of the theoretical framework by examining three cases. First, the theory is utilized in the context of a truncated virial expansion in solution concentration to derive an expression for the solute partition coefficient. Second, the theory is utilized to model protein partitioning in two-phase aqueous surfactant solutions. Third, the theory is utilized to qualitatively predict the partitioning behavior of proteins in a model two-phase aqueous polymer solution, accounting explicitly for the semidilute nature of the concentrated polymer solution phase, We find that the theory captures many of the salient experimental trends observed in protein partitioning in two-phase aqueous polymer solutions.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA; MIT, CTR MAT SCI & ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,"Lue, Leo/E-7846-2011","Lue, Leo/0000-0002-4826-5337",,,,41,22,22,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

To address the deficiencies with the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue, a new fixative, epoxy compound, was used to fix biological prostheses, The study was undertaken to investigate the fixation rates and crosslinking densities of biological tissues fixed with various epoxy compounds. These epoxy compounds are different in their chemical structures, Glutaraldehyde was used as a control, The fixation rates and crosslinking densities of the fixed tissues were determined by measuring their fixation indices and denaturation temperatures, respectively. Generally, the epoxy-fixed tissues were more pliable than the glutaraldehyde-fixed one. Furthermore, the tissues fixed with monofunctional epoxy compound were more pliable than those fixed with multifunctional epoxy compounds. With increasing pH or temperature, the fixation rate of epoxy compound increased, However, the number of epoxide functional groups did not seem to affect the fixation rate of the epoxy compound. The fixation rate of glutaraldehyde was faster than that of epoxy compounds, Additionally, the crosslinking density of the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue was greater than that of the epoxy-fixed counterparts, Moreover, it was noted that the denaturation temperatures of the tissues fixed with glutaraldehyde or multifunctional epoxy compounds were significantly higher than the fresh ones (p <0.05), while that fixed with monofunctional epoxy compound stayed roughly the same throughout the entire fixation process (p >0.05). The results obtained in this study may be used to optimize the fixation process for developing bioprostheses fixed with epoxy compounds.

In this study, the activation of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by the products from a rabbit synovial cell line (HIG-82) stimulated by various particles was investigated using rabbit unfractionated bone cells cultured on a dentin slice. The HIG cells were challenged with the following laboratory-made particles: high-density polyethylene (PE), cobalt alloy (Co-Cr), titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), pure titanium (Ti), and sintered hydroxyapatite (HA). The size of each particle was <2 mu m. The supernatants from HIG cells cultured with the appropriate concentration of wear particles were added to unfractionated bone cells on a dentin slice, and then resorbed areas were determined for each particle. Interestingly, resorbed areas significantly increased only when the culture medium from HIG cells with PE particles was added to unfractionated bone cells. This study demonstrates that PE particles stimulate the rabbit synovial cells to produce soluble factors that induce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Moreover, this experimental model is a useful method sensitively to evaluate the effects of soluble factors from the cells stimulated by particulate biomaterials from joint prostheses on osteoclastic bone resorption.

We hypothesize that the extent of complement activation is modulated by biomaterial formulation and the presence of fluid shear stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested base poly(etherurethane ureas) formulated with or without Santowhite(R) antioxidant, a nucleophilic additive. We found that adherent leukocyte densities decreased with increasing shear stress. Moreover, leukocyte adhesion was decreased significantly further by Santowhite(R) additive under shear stress but not under static conditions. Monocytes showed a higher propensity for adhesion than did neutrophils under shear and static conditions. Under static conditions, adherent cells on the Santowhite(R)-containing polyurethane had a slightly more activated morphology than those on the base polyurethane. Cell adhesion under shear stress was significantly decreased when C3 or fibronectin was depleted from the suspension medium. Santowhite(R) additive increased Factor B adsorption to the test surface while shear stress increased Factor H adsorption. The combination of Santowhite(R) additive and shear stress increased the adsorption of both Factor B and Factor H and the serum protein S-terminal complement complex levels, but it did not further increase the state of activation of adherent cells. We conclude the leukocyte adhesion on poly(etherurethane urea) surfaces is sensitive to the levels of shear stress and that both C3 and fibronectin are required to maintain adhesion in the presence of shear stress. The low state of cellular activation and increased Factor H adsorption may explain the decreased adherent leukocyte density on the Santowhite(R)-containing polyurethane.

Methods: Discs of test materials were glued to specially designed plastic (Delrin(R)) buttons and implanted into the superior and inferior venae cavae of sheep through a right thoracotomy. The button and disc had such configuration that the blood flow was minimally disturbed. Up to four different materials could be tested simultaneously in each animal: two in superior vena cava and two in inferior vena cava. The materials and their respective implantation sites were changed between different animals according to the Latin square principle. Ten animals were used. Three materials currently used in mechanical heart valve prostheses - titanium, cobalt-chromium alloy (Haynes 25(R)) and pyrolytic carbon (Pyrolite(R) - together with a surface modified (methylated) titanium were evaluated. No heparin was given during the experiment. After two hours of testing, the discs were explanted and evaluated for hemocampatibility. The thrombus area on each disc was measured with photography and planimetry. Platelet and leukocyte adhesion on the surfaces were quantitatively assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that there were significant differences in thrombus formation (p = 0.001) and leukocyte adhesion (p = 0.002) between the materials tested.

The authors have compared the effects of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and glutaraldehyde (the de facto industrial standard crosslinker) on the hydrothermal, biochemical, and uniaxial mechanical properties of bovine pericardium. EDC crosslinking was optimized for maximum increase in collagen denaturation temperature using variables of pH, concentration, and ratio of EDC to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS): a reagent for formation of activated esters. EDC and glutaraldehyde crosslinked materials were subjected to hydrothermal denaturation tests, biochemical degradation by enzymes (collagenase, trypsin) and CNBr, amino acid analysis for unreacted lysine, and to high strain rate mechanical tests including: large deformation stress-strain studies (0.1 to 10 Hz), stress relaxation experiments (loading time 0.1 s) and small deformation forced vibration (1 and 10 Hz). A protocol for EDC crosslinking was developed which used 1.15% EDC (2:1 EDC:NHS) at pH 5.5 for 24 h. The increase in denaturation temperature for EDC (from 69.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C to 86.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C) was equivalent to that produced by glutaraldehyde (85.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C). Both treatments equivalently increased resistance to collagenase and CNBr degradation; however, after denaturation, the EDC-treated tissue was slightly more resistant to collagenase, and markedly more resistant to trypsin. EDC-treated materials were more extensible and more elastic than glutaraldehyde-treated materials. Despite the differences in crosslinking mechanism, EDC and glutaraldehyde-treated materials are very similar. Subtle but intriguing differences in biochemical structure remain to be investigated.",,"Lee, JM (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO, ON M5S 1A1, CANADA.",,,,,,,68,86,90,4,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

This study examines the spinal fusion enhancement potential of some osteoconductive and osteoinductive biomaterials. METHODS: Four similar canines received unilateral posterolateral fusions on the left side at T13-L1 and L4-L5 and on the right side at L2-L3 and L6-L7. The experiments were grouped as follows: Group A, autogenous bone harvested from the iliac crest; Group B, autogenous bone and collagen; Group C, no implant; and Group D, autogenous bone, collagen, and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2. Radiographic assessment, three-dimensional computed tomographic volumetric analysis, and biomechanical testing were performed at each level. RESULTS: For Groups A and B, the fusions demonstrated moderate bone formation at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Group D fusions exhibited earlier and more dramatic increases in volume and radiodensity and eventually were comparable in size to the vertebral bodies. Average fusion volumes computed from three-dimensional computed tomographic analysis were: Group A = 1.243 cc, Group B = 0.900 cc, Group C = 0.000 cc, and Group D = 6.668 cc (P = 0.003 compared to Group A). Group D exhibited flexion and extension biomechanical properties much greater than controls. The addition of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 consistently yielded the strongest fused segments and, on average, enhanced extension stiffness by 626% and flexion stiffness by 1120% over controls. CONCLUSION: The most advantageous spinal fusion implant matrix consisted of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2, autogenous bone, and collagen. Future investigators, however, need to examine the appropriate quantities of the individual components and clarify the efficacy of the matrix for the various types of spinal fusion approaches.","UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT RADIOL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA; UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA; UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOPHYS, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA","Sheehan, JP (reprint author), UNIV VIRGINIA, HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT NEUROL SURG, BOX 212, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA.",,,,,,,34,34,34,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0148-396X,1524-4040,,NEUROSURGERY,Neurosurgery,SEP,1996.0,39,3,,,,,548,554,,10.1097/00006123-199609000-00023,,,,7,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,VE304,WOS:A1996VE30400050,8875485.0,,,,2019-02-25

Many other devices, such as orthodontic appliances, surgical instruments and venous catheters, are treated to improve friction, fretting resistance and biocompatibility.

(1994) ACS Symp. Ser. 567, 134-147]. Preferentially excluded solutes are also known to stabilize quaternary structure, which enhances the thermostability of multimeric proteins in aqueous systems. Also, it has been suggested that retention of quaternary structure may play a role in the protection of multimeric proteins by polymers during freeze-drying (lyophilization). Although preferential solute exclusion cannot occur in the absence of water, we reasoned that polymers could protect multimeric proteins during freeze-drying by stabilizing quaternary structure in the frozen state. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis and demonstrate that bovine serum albumin and polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilize lactate dehydrogenase by inhibiting dissociation in the frozen solution, during the initial phase of the sublimation step of lyophilization. Dissociation at this critical step correlated directly with decreased recovery of enzyme activity after rehydration. The damage to the protein, under conditions where dissociation was studied, was due to a large decrease in pH in the frozen state (e.g., from pH 7.5 to 4.5), which was attenuated by protective levels of polymers. Thus, inhibition of freezing-induced pH shifts, in addition to stabilization by the preferential exclusion mechanism, plays an important role in the protection conferred by polymers. Furthermore, high concentrations of these polymers were capable of maintaining quaternary structure during subsequent drying and rehydration. We suggest that the proximate cause for increased recovery of active, native protein after lyophilization is that the holoenzyme is more resistant to the stresses of drying/rehydration than unassociated monomers.

Application to synthesis of polymeric biomaterials featuring intrinsic radiopacity,MACROMOLECULES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BLOOD COMPATIBLE POLYMERS,"The properties of co- and terpolymers (physical, mechanical, chemical, biocompatibility, etc.) strongly depend on their microstructural details. In the course of our research work on biomaterials that feature intrinsic radiopacity, we became interested in the microstructural details of co- and terpolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and 2-(2'-iodobenzoyl)ethyl methacrylate (1) or 2-(4'-iodobenzoyl)ethyl methacrylate (2). A new method, based on H-1-NMR at 400 MHz, was used to study the copolymerization reactions 1 + HEMA, 1 + MMA, 2 + HEMA, and 2 + MMA. This method was found to be convenient, fast, and accurate, and it is put forward that this approach can also be applied to study other copolymerization reactions. The results, obtained with the error-invariables method (EVM), are as follows: 1 + HEMA, r(1) = 1.09 +/- 0.14, r(HEMA) = 1.12 +/- 0.06; 1 + MMA, r(1) = 0.54 +/- 0.12, r(MMA) = 0.67 +/- 0.06; 2 + HEMA, r(2) = 2.18 +/- 0.72, r(HEMA) = 2.29 +/- 0.38; 2 + MMA, r(2) = 0.93 +/- 0.32, r(MMA) = 0.90 +/- 0.13. Based on these data, a triad analysis was performed. It is concluded that all four copolymerizations afford random-type macromolecules. Therefore, it is most likely that terpolymers consisting of 1 or 2, HEMA, and MMA will also have a random character. This conclusion is of interest, since it gives a better insight into the different biochemical and physicochemical properties of this type of co-/terpolymers. The results imply that random copolymers, built-up from a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic component, can also exhibit low thrombogenicity; this is in line with recent studies by Mathew et al.

Significant differences were observed among the volumes and white blood cell (WBC) counts of the pouch exudates, based on the various crystal types used to induce inflammation, A strong correlation was demonstrated between the specific surface (SS) area of the injected crystals and the area under the curve for induced WBC count versus time (R(2) = 0.88, P = 0.05), This correlation was observed for SS area values below 50 m(2)/gm, but when SS area increased further, this parameter plateaued, Another parameter of inflammatory response was obtained by dividing the area under the curve figuring WBC counts versus time by the corresponding SS area for each crystal type, This parameter increased linearly with the Ca:P ratio (R(2) = 0.97, P = 0.0003), Conclusion. The inflammatory potential of BCP crystals appeared to vary according to crystal features, SS area and the Ca:P ratio (which correlates with crystal solubility) influenced inflammatory properties, These results could explain the variable clinical consequences of BCP deposits, and must be taken into account in the choice of apatite ceramics for use as biomaterials.","ECOLE NATL SUPER CHIM,URA CNRS 445,TOULOUSE,FRANCE; LAB RECH ORTHOPED,URA CNRS 1432,PARIS,FRANCE","Prudhommeaux, F (reprint author), UNIV PARIS 07,HOP LARIBOISIERE,CTR VIGGO PETERSEN,LAB HISTOPATHOL SYNOVIALE ER 254,F-75475 PARIS 10,FRANCE.",,,,,,,46,48,48,1,4,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0004-3591,,,ARTHRITIS RHEUM,Arthritis Rheum.,AUG,1996.0,39,8,,,,,1319,1326,,10.1002/art.1780390809,,,,8,Rheumatology,Rheumatology,VB470,WOS:A1996VB47000008,8702440.0,,,,2019-02-25

Studies of drug sorption to new catheter materials are therefore important. Pellethane(TM), a polyurethane increasingly used in vascular access catheters, is as yet little studied in terms of its capacity for drug sorption. In this work a range of drugs known to be sorbed by PVC infusion sets were studied with respect to their sorption by Pellethane catheters. Standard lengths of catheter were incubated with solutions of drugs and samples of the solution were taken at intervals, assayed spectrophotometrically and compared with control solutions incubated without catheter. Losses from solution of up to 93% were found after 24 h. A series of highly sorbing and clinically relevant drugs was identified and their uptake was studied until equilibrium had been reached. A correlation was evident between the octanol/water partition coefficient and the fraction of drug taken up from solution at equilibrium, with the more hydrophobic drugs being taken up to a greater extent by the catheter.

The wide variety of polymeric biomaterials currently used for stent fabrication suggests that no single material is significantly superior to the others at resisting encrustation. A model representing upper urinary tract conditions was employed to compare the long-term struvite and hydroxyapatite encrustation of five materials currently used in the fabrication of ureteral stents. Silicone was least prone to struvite encrustation, followed by polyurethane, silitek, percuflex and hydrogel-coated polyurethane, in rank order. Similarly, silicone was least prone to hydroxyapatite encrustation, followed by silitek, polyurethane, percuflex and hydrogel-coated polyurethane.

Whereas nanoparticles made from PLA and stabilized by surfactants (PLA-F68) are rapidly phagocytized, the rate of phagocytosis is strongly reduced in case of nanoparticles made from a diblock copolymer (PLA-PEO). Because of the role of the complement system in opsonization, this difference of phagocytosis was hypothesized to be related to this system. An important complement consumption was obtained in 5 min in the presence of PLA-F68 particles. In the presence of a higher surface area of PLA-PEO particles possessing a high PEO surface density, the consumption remained very low. When the average PEO surface density was decreased on such particles below a given threshold, a fast and strong complement consumption occurred again. These experimental data support the concept of steric repulsion towards proteins, by surfaces covered with terminally attached PEO chains and emphasize the prime importance of PEO surface density in such an effect. The major, but probably not exclusive, role of complement as an opsonin capable of inducing a fast phagocytosis by MPS should be taken into account concerning the in vitro evaluation of nanoparticles as candidates for a long blood circulation.

Collagen (type III) was also linked with the carboxylic group of PAA grafted onto the SR surface via a carbodiimine agent to obtain a secondary structure of SR. The SR surface properties were characterized by ATR-FTIR, ESCA, contact angle, and SEM. The biocompatibility of the SR surface was evaluated by a culture of cornea epithelial (CE) cells. Subsequently, 75-450 mu g cm(-2) of pAA were obtained on the SR surfaces under different reactive conditions; 3-12 mu g cm(-2) of collagen were linked on modified surfaces of SR. Moreover, ATR-FTIR and ESCA were utilized to confirm the proceedings of these reactions. The hydrophility of the modified SR was measured by a contact angle meter. The values of contact angle for SR grafted with pAA were approximately 45-50 degrees; a 50-55 degrees contact angle on pAA-g-SR to be further linked with collagen was subsequently obtained. Moreover, the influence of surface properties toward migration, growth and attachment of CE cells on the modified surfaces was also examined. Here, untreated SR was used as a control. Experimental results indicated that the number of CE cells attached onto the controlled SR was negligible. The attach ment of cells onto pAA-grafted surfaces was clearly observed and peusopoda occurred; however, cell growth was depressed. This depression may have been caused by the acid environ ment of the pAA-grafted membrane. Nevertheless, both cell attachment and growth onto collagen-linked surfaces were significant. In addition, the morphology of the cells attached onto this surface was considered normal for primary cells. Collagen introduced on the SR surface was not denatured, i.e. the natural properties of collagen were maintained. The results obtained in this study will hopefully lead to the successful development of modified SR for clinical applications.

Several advantages of peat moss for such applications include its abundance, low cost, and high metal capacity. A Ca-loaded column of peat moss was therefore studied with mixtures of metals. Metals bind to anionic sites by displacing protons from acidic groups (K-ex(H)) or existing metals from anionic sites at high pH (K-ex). These ion-exchange equilibrium constants were determined in batch experiments by direct measurement of species in solution and sorbed on the solid phase.

Under conditions employed for a Mg/Mn mixture, it was found that ion-exchange equilibria were maintained along the column due to very fast rates for metal-metal exchange as measured in a separate kinetic study. A linear relationship for log K-ex(H) vs pH over 10(6) was interpreted as due to metal binding to sites of different acid strengths.","MESSIAH COLL,GRANTHAM,PA 17027; GEORGETOWN UNIV,DEPT CHEM,WASHINGTON,DC 20057",,,,,,,,27,120,122,1,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Clinically, these patients may require an ACL reconstruction. In an attempt to develop an improved ligament prosthesis, a prototype xenograft - an epoxy-fixed porcine Achilles tendon - was developed. The study was intended to investigate the crosslinking characteristics of the epoxy-fixed porcine tendons fixed at different pHs (4.0, 7.4, 9.0, and 10.5), temperatures (4, 25, and 37 degrees C), and fixative concentrations (1, 2, or 4%). Samples of each group were taken out at various elapsed fixation periods. The crosslinking characteristics-fixation index, denaturation temperature, and moisture content - of each sample were determined. Additionally, the stiffness of the epoxy-fixed tendons under various fixation conditions was qualitatively compared. Ln the study it was noted that the color of porcine Achilles tendons remained natural after epoxy fixation. With increasing pH, temperature, or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed tendons increased. However, the fixed porcine tendons tended to be stiffer at a higher pH, temperature, or fixative concentration. The moisture contents of the epoxy-fixed tendons were relatively lower than the fresh ones, while they were approximately the same at different pHs, temperatures, and fixative concentrations. The implications of these findings for the epoxy-fixed porcine tendons in ACL reconstruction require further investigation.

This is due (in part) to the failure of these materials to mimic the mechanical properties of the host tissue they replace. If bioprosthetic materials could be engineered to meet the mechanical performance required in vivo, the functional lifetime of implants would be increased. In this study, glutaraldehyde/solvent solutions of decreasing dielectric constant (polarity) were utilized to modify the properties of crosslinked collagen in whole bovine pericardial tissue. Solvents included phosphate buffer, methanol, 95% (w/w) ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol. Exogenous crosslinking was verified in collagen by thermal denaturation tests and amino acid analyses. Tensile mechanical behavior of collagenous pericardial samples was found to depend upon the dielectric constant (polarity) of the glutaraldehyde/solvent solutions employed; however, treatment in the solvents alone had little, if any, effect. As the dielectric constant of the solvents decreased, three mechanical properties were systematically altered: plastic strain fell from a mean of 8.9 +/- 1.5% (buffer) to 1.6 +/- 0.4% (n-butanol); strain at fracture increased from 32.2 +/- 2.6% (buffer) to 55.6 +/- 4.6% (n-butanol); and percent stress remaining after 1000-s stress relaxation from an 80-g initial load fell from 86.3 +/- 1.1% (buffer) to 76.9 +/- 1.0% (n-butanol). Crosslinking using a glutaraldehyde/n-butanol solution produced materials with tensile mechanical behavior that was very close to that of fresh tissue; however, the flexural properties of the treated tissue were different from those of fresh tissue. This decoupling of the flexural and tensile mechanical behaviors of crosslinked bioprosthetic materials is unique to this form of treatment. The observed phenomena may be the results of conformational changes in collagen facilitated by polar/nonpolar interactions with the solvent that are ''locked in'' by the action of glutaraldehyde. This technique may aid in the ''customized'' design of mechanical properties in tissue-derived biomaterials.

A 7 x 5 cm prosthesis of STP (n = 12) or MM (n = 12) was implanted into a defect of the same size (involving all layers except skin) created in the anterior abdominal wall in 24 New Zealand rabbits. The prostheses were anchored to the recipient tissue, in direct contact with the intestinal loops and connective tissue. After 14, 30, 60 and 90 days, groups of six implants were studied macroscopically and samples were taken to be processed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemical studies and tensiometry. All animals were valid for the study. In th ree cases STP implants presented very loose adhesions in the peripheral zones corresponding to the sutures. They were also observed on three MM implants, in the area of the perforations. Light and scanning microscopy revealed the formation of a capsule of scar tissue surrounding both types of prosthesis. At day 90, bridges of connective tissue had formed in the perforated areas of MM. Good vascularization was established in the areas of recipient tissue corresponding to both implants. The macrophage reaction to both biomaterials was maximal at 14 days, after which it progressively decreased until day 90. Tensile testing revealed no significant differences between the two biomaterials. It is concluded that (a) behaviour in the peritoneal interface is similar in the two prostheses, (b) both biomaterials become encapsulated rather than integrated into the recipient tissue, (c) the foreign body reaction does not determine the success or failure of the implants, (d) The perforations of the MM prosthesis do not increase its resistance to stress, or at least not after 90 days of implantation into rabbit abdominal wall.",,"Bellon, JM (reprint author), UNIV ALCALA DE HENARES, FAC MED, DEPT MORPHOL SCI & SURG, KM 33600, E-28871 MADRID, SPAIN.",,"Hernando, Antonio/E-2105-2015","Hernando, Antonio/0000-0001-7856-3768; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011",,,,14,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA in the HL60 cells cultured on various substrates and in Various conditions was studied. Expression of IL-1 beta could be successfully determined by RT-PGR analysis. A 48 h incubation period was necessary to clarify the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA.

The PMN were exposed to a shear stress of 0.19 Pa (1.9 dynes cm(-2)) or were allowed to adhere without the stress component (static control) during 30 min for all four biomaterials. Observation by light microscopy was performed in situ in the flow chamber at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. The total number of adherent cells as a function of time and the activation status of the population on the basis of morphological criteria were determined. On the hydrophilic material adhesion of activated PMN was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than on the more hydrophobic surfaces. This effect was most pronounced for the adhesion of neutrophils to glass and polypropylene (PP). Polyethylene (PE) showed only minor adhesion rates. Scanning electron microscopy revealed details of cell shape changes and permitted a more precise classification of populations of neutrophils based on distinctive shapes. As PMN were exposed to shear stress on glass, the majority of cells exhibited surface veils, ridges and ruffles, suggesting a high level of cell migration. In this case, on polymeric surfaces the presence of filopodial networks (FEP-Teflon) and ameoboid cell shapes (PP and PE) was noted. The results suggest that a low shear stress, as well as various chemical and physical properties of biomaterial surfaces, are together responsible for differentiation of PMN populations on solid substrata.

The objective was to test the effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the attempt to modulate the adhesive process, thus improving the biomaterial/visceral peritoneum interface. We have carried out an experimental study using the New Zealand white rabbit, implanting a 7 x 5 cm(2) polypropylene prosthesis into the anterior abdominal wall in such a way that it replaced all the tissue layers and was in contact with the intestinal loops. Three study groups were established: group I (control), in which only implantation of the biomaterial was performed; group II, in which the prosthesis was pretreated with a solution of PC; and group III, in which the implants were treated as in group II and the animals underwent intraperitoneal administration of 10 ml of the same solution. The animals were killed on postimplantation day 14. The total surface of the prosthesis occupied by adhesions was measured and light and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyse the healing process. In comparison with the controls, groups II and III did not present significant differences with respect to the resistance or extension of the adhesions. The microscopic results showed a rapid formation of disorderly and well-vascularised scar tissue enveloping the entire prosthesis. Thus, PC was unable to modulate the process of adhesion formation between the prosthesis and the organs of the abdominal cavity; nor did it induce changes in the cells of sufficient importance to alter the results of the healing process in the presence of this biomaterial.

Double layered collagenic matrices were prepared with purified collagens extracted from human placental tissues. Two types of patches were tested, the first constituted from a collagen type I+III layer covered by collagen IV in a liquid phase (patch I+III/IV) and the second from a collagen IV layer covered by liquid collagen IV (patch IV/IV). The matrices were applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic wall defect in the rat. Healing evolution was determined by macroscopic, microscopic and immunostaining studies. The reconstitution of the three colonic wall layers was achieved within 45 days without retraction or inflammatory reaction, while the biomaterial was resorbed. Human collagen I and III antibodies failed to stain extracellular matrix. This failure may be a consequence of outdated antibodies or more likely epitope alteration during extraction and preparation of the collagens. A human collagen type IV antibody staining of the scar zone showed the basement membranes of newly developed vessels within 10 days, and newly formed colonic mucosa within 20 days. The collagen reconstituted matrix was able to assist healing of normal digestive tract defects as shown by the labelling of the new synthesized extracellular matrix by collagen type IV antibody. These findings support the use of collagen biomaterial in gastro-intestinal anastomosis. This new surgical approach allowing healing of colonic wall defects could reduce occurrence of anastomotic leakage in human.

Structural forms have included bulk solids or particulates with and without porosities for tissue ingrowth, and more recently, coatings onto other types of biomaterial substrates. The physical shapes selected were application dependent, with advantages and disadvantages determined by: (1) the basic material and design properties of the device construct; and (2) the patient-based functional considerations. Most of the ceramics (bioceramics) selected in the 1960s and 1970s have continued over the long-term, and the science and technology for thick and thin coatings have evolved significantly over the past decade. Applications of ceramic biomaterials range from bulk (100%) ceramic structures as joint and bone replacements to fully or partially biodegradable substrates for the controlled delivery of pharmaceutical drugs, growth factors, and morphogenetically inductive substances. Because of the relatively unique properties of bioceramics, expanded uses as structural composites with other biomaterials and macromolecular biologically-derived substances are anticipated in the future.",,"Lemons, JE (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA,509 MED EDUC BLDG,1813 6TH AVE S,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294, USA.",,,,,,,48,33,33,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",8756-3282,,,BONE,Bone,JUL,1996.0,19,1,,S,,,S121,S128,,10.1016/S8756-3282(96)00128-7,,,,8,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,UW664,WOS:A1996UW66400010,8831003.0,,,,2019-02-25

Polyurethanes revisited,JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SMALL-DIAMETER; THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANES; ANASTOMOTIC HYPERPLASIA; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; PROSTHESES; ELASTOMER; HEPARIN; LEADS,"Polyurethanes are considered to be one of the most bio- and blood-compatible biomaterials known today. By intelligent utilization of principles governing the structure/property relationship of these polymers, one can generate systems which resemble, in principle, the physical-mechanical behavior of living tissue. Thus, it is not surprising that these materials played a major role in development of small caliber vascular grafts targeted for vascular access, peripheral and coronary artery bypass indications. Numerous technologies, often esoteric in nature, were and are utilized to generate porous, potentially multilayered conduits possessing some or many characteristics of natural blood vessels. Properties such as durability elasticity, compliance, pulsatility, and propensity for healing became attainable via polyurethanes. Furthermore, additional surface and/or bulk modification via attachments of biologically active species such as anticoagulants, cell proliferation suppressants, anti-infective compounds or biorecognizable groups are possible due to reactive groups which are part of the polyurethane structure. These modifications are designed to control or mediate host acceptance and healing of the graft. Finally, a myriad of practical processing technologies are used to fabricate functional grafts. Among those, casting, electrostatic and wet spinning of fibers and monofilaments, extrusion, dip coating or spraying of mandrels with polymer/additive solutions are often coupled with chemical-potential-difference-driven coagulation and phase inversion leading to grafts feeling and often behaving like natural vessels. Historically, the first polyurethanes utilized were hydrolytically unstable polyester polyurethanes containing hydrolysis-prone polyester polyols as soft segments, followed by hydrolytically stable but oxidation sensitive polyether polyols based polyurethanes. Polyether-based polyurethanes and their clones containing silicone and other modifying polymeric intermediates represented significant progress. Many viable technologies were discovered and developed using polyether-based polyurethanes. Chronic in vivo instability observed on prolonged implantation became, however, a major roadblock. The path led finally to the use of hydrolytically and oxidatively stable polycarbonate polyols as the soft segment to generate biodurable materials with resistance to biodegradation adequate for vascular access or perhaps peripheral graft indications. This biodurability needs to be further increased in order to utilize the full potential of polyurethanes in development of patent small caliber graft. Modification of both the soft and hard segments needs to be considered in order to maximize biodurability of both basic building blocks of the polyurethane. This paper reviews the achievements, discusses trends, and offers the view of the future in this exciting area of material/device combination.","CARDIOTECH INT INC, WOBURN, MA 01801 USA",,,,,,,,90,64,67,4,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0885-3282,1530-8022,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

A comparison with conventional metallic alloys used as articular implants is established. To determine the corrosion behavior we employed electrochemical methods: evaluation of corrosion potential E(corr), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and anodic polarization curves. The corrosion resistance of the MA-956 superalloy preoxidized at 1100 degrees C during 100 h is at least two orders of magnitude higher than for the other alloys. This satisfactory behavior is stationary with time. Also the probability of the appearance of the pitting corrosion process is very low. When cracking is generated in the alpha-alumina layer the repassivation process is assured because of the high Cr content in the superalloy. This study is the first step in proposing this new alloy as a biomaterial. The low toxicity of these metallic alloys in the physiological environment suggests that in vivo their biocompatibility could be satisfactory.

The measured light-scattering coefficients of the implant synovial fluid samples were significantly larger than the coefficients of the control samples (p < 0.0001). The enhanced light scattering was attributed to the presence of submicron UHMWPE particles. This is consistent with light-scattering considerations and a Raman spectroscopy survey of synovial fluid. The mean particle volume fraction of UHMWPE was 1.11 x 10(-5) cm(3)/mL for the six implant samples, with mean particle diameters in the range of 200-300 nm. The UHMWPE volume fractions were found to differ by a factor of 2 between the osteolytic and nonosteolytic cases. The current findings warrant further work to determine the role of submicron polyethylene debris in the wear mechanisms of biomaterials and in the development of osteolysis following total knee replacement.

When the surface of segmented polyurethane, in which endothelial cells are not capable of proliferating, is modified by carbon deposition, cell adhesion and proliferation occurred selectively on the carbon-deposited region. Carbon deposition to a tissue culture-treated polystyrene surface on which cells are capable of proliferating further promoted cell spreading and proliferation. Cell patterning on carbon-deposited segmented polyurethane was also attempted by controlling the direction or region of cell proliferation. Carbon deposition onto the polymer surface brought about a decrease in the water contact angle of the surface. Precoating fibronectin or laminin on the carbon-deposited polymer surface brought about cell adhesion and proliferation in the carbon-deposited region, but not in the non-carbon-deposited region. Our data suggest that promotion of cell proliferation on a carbon-deposited surface is probably due to selective adhesion of adhesive proteins to the surface.

In particular, the -OH functionality of the monomer is increasingly retained in the plasma generated thin films as the radio frequency duty cycle is lowered. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of the films obtained reveal that excellent film chemistry control is achieved during plasma polymerization of this monomer.

A heavy infiltrate of foreign body macrophages in response to biomaterial wear particles is commonly found in the fibrous membrane surrounding loose components. It has recently been shown that foreign body macrophages can differentiate into osteoclastic cells. To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of bone resorption have a role to play in controlling the osteolysis of aseptic loosening, we analyzed the effect of a bisphosphonate, disodium ethane-1, 1-diphosphonate (EHDP) on this process. Murine monocytes and foreign body macrophages (derived from granulomas formed by subcutaneous implantation of particles of prosthetic biomaterials) were co-cultured with UMR106 osteoblast-like cells in the presence of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D-3 for 14 days on glass coverslips and bone slices. EHDP significantly inhibited bone resorption in these co-cultures. There was little or no expression of the osteoclast-associated enzyme, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in EHDP-treated co-cultures. Addition of EHDP to monocyte-UMR106 co-cultures after the appearance of TRAP-positive cells did not abolish bone resorption, indicating that EHDP, in addition to its known inhibitory effect on osteoclast function, suppresses differentiation of osteoclast precursors. EHDP inhibition of the osteolysis induced by particulate biomaterial-associated macrophages shows that pharmacological inhibition of bone resorption might be used to control the osteolysis of aseptic loosening.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,DEPT PATHOL,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,NUFFIELD DEPT PATHOL & BACTERIOL,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND",,,,,Wellcome Trust,,,33,26,29,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0001-6470,,,ACTA ORTHOP SCAND,Acta Orthop.

This turn of events was made possible by an improved understanding of the biological response of living tissues to implants as well as clinical trials that validated the long-term success of these implants. Despite major structural differences between teeth and implants, such as the absence of a periodontal ligament around implants, the latter appear to provide a reliable functional replacement for their natural counterparts. This review briefly summarizes the major structural differences of the interfacial region of teeth and dental implants and their supporting tissues. It focuses on our current understanding of the soft and hard tissue responses to submerged and nonsubmerged root-form dental implants. The influence of a number of factors that affect the tissue response is reviewed, including biomaterials, implant design, surgical technique, and the local microbiota. Our recently acquired ability to modulate wound healing with guided tissue regeneration and growth factors will undoubtedly play an important role in the future utilization and success rates of dental implants.

Methods-Biomaterial particles (polymethylmethacrylate, high density polyethylene, titanium, chromium-cobalt, stainless steel) were implanted subcutaneously into mice. Macrophages were isolated from the foreign body granulomas that resulted, cultured on bone slices and coverslips, and assessed for both cytochemical and functional evidence of osteoclast differentiation. Results-Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) negative macrophages isolated from granulomas containing particles of all types of biomaterial composition were capable of differentiating into TRAP positive cells capable of extensive lacunar bone resorption (assessed by scanning electron microscopy). The presence of both UMR106 rat osteoblast-like cells and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-3 was necessary for this to occur. Conclusion-All implant materials produce wear particles that are the focus of a heavy foreign body macrophage response in the fibrous membrane between a loose implant component and the host bone undergoing resorption. These findings underline the importance of biomaterial wear particle generation and the macrophage response to different types of biomaterial wear particles in the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening.","UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,NUFFIELD DEPT PATHOL & BACTERIOL,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,MRC,BONE RES LAB,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND",,,"Murray, David/D-7117-2011",,Wellcome Trust,,,39,60,63,0,0,BRITISH MED JOURNAL PUBL GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND WC1H 9JR",0003-4967,,,ANN RHEUM DIS,Ann.

This result raises the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway may be involved in the regulation of cell-biomaterial interaction. To learn more about the interaction of anchorage-dependent cells with biomaterials, four different materials with wettability ranging from hydrophilic (water contact angle 25 degrees) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 111 degrees) were investigated, i.e. clean glass (glass), aminopropylsilane (APS), octadecylsilane (ODS) and silicone (SI). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed increased stress formation and fibronectin (FN) receptor-rich focal adhesions for fibroblasts attached on more hydrophilic surfaces (glass and APS) in comparison to the relatively hydrophobic materials (ODS and SI). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, also studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, was considerably higher on glass and APS, lower for ODS, negligible for SI, and was found to colocalize with FN receptor-rich focal adhesions. Preadsorption of FN tended to restore cell adhesion and spreading on the hydrophobic ODS and SI. Quantitative data on cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation showed moderate wettable material maximum values for APS, followed by glass, ODS and SI, demonstrating a non-linearity of these parameters with the wettability of materials. Interestingly, the preadsorption of FN increased both parameters, particularly for the hydrophobic materials ODS and SI. Phosphorylation of tyrosine on FN-coated substrata was corroborated by the accessibility of binding sites estimated by ELISA using polyclonal and monoclonal FN antibodies. Our results suggest that measurement of the phosphotyrosine activity of cells may be a sensitive parameter for the ability of biomaterials to support the attachment and proliferation of cells.

Design: Open study. Setting: Specialist clinic, USA. Subjects: 3480 Out of a total of 4000 men whose primary inguinal hernias were repaired between June 1984 and June 1995. Interventions: Hernia repair involving total reinforcement of the transversalis fascia with mesh. Main outcome measure: Morbidity, particularly recurrence. Results: A total of 1776 (44.4%) were direct hernias, 1724 (43.2%) indirect, and 500 (12.5%) a combination; 456 (11.4%) were sliding hernias. Patients were followed up for a mean of 5 1/2 years (range 1-11) and 520 were lost to follow-up, leaving 3480 (87.0%) for analysis. All patients followed up were examined by a physician. There were five recurrences (0.1%), four at the pubic tubercle and one in which the mesh had torn away from the inguinal ligament because it was too narrow. There has been one recurrence in the last six years of the study. One patient developed orchitis. There was one case of postoperative neuralgia. There were no seromas that required aspiration. Most patients had returned to work within two weeks, including the manual workers. Conclusion: Repair of primary inguinal hernias under local anaesthesia with the open, tension-free technique using polypropylene mesh results in acceptable morbidity, and appreciable reductions in postoperative discomfort, duration of hospital stay, recurrence rate and costs.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,HARBOR MED CTR,RES & EDUC INST,DEPT SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,CEDARS SINAI MED CTR,DEPT SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024","Amid, PK (reprint author), LICHTENSTEIN HERNIA INST,9201 SUNSET BLVD,SUITE 505,LOS ANGELES,CA 90069, USA.",,,,,,,39,184,191,0,5,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Correlations were made between the number of adherent bacterial cells (S, aureus) and each of the calculated components of surface free energy (ie., dispersion, polarity and hydrogen bond) of biomaterials. The effect of antibodies to cell-adhesion molecules on bacterial adhesion was also studied using monoclonal antibodies to vitronectin receptor fibronectin receptor and CD44. This study indicates the polarity component of surface free energy plays a dominant role in the process of bacterial adhesion at least in vitro. The number of cells adherent to materials decreased to 44-73% of the control value in the presence of antibodies tested showing that cell adhesion molecules affect adherence to biomaterials. Moreover, the results suggested that bacterial adhesion was prevented by specific blockade of cell adhesion molecule receptors.","OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT BACTERIOL,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN","Kitano, T (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ABENO KU,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,10,11,0,1,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Bovine periosteum-derived cells were cultivated in vitro, put onto bio-resorbable polymer fiber constructs, and allowed to grow until most of the fibers were coated with multiple layers of osteoblasts. Standardized 9-mm nonhealing defects were created in 24 male athymic rat femurs and bridged with titanium miniplates. In 12 animals, the defects were filled with polymer constructs containing periosteum-derived cells (experimental group); in another 12 animals, the defects were either left unfilled (control group I) or filled with polymer templates alone (control group II). After 12-week in vivo implantation, the new bone produced bridged the surgically created defects completely in seven of 10 cases. The animals of the control groups did not show significant bone formation in the gap. Histologic evaluation revealed bone formation in all experimental specimens with rests of cartilage islands showing hypertrophying chondrocytes indicative of enchondral bone formation. Tissue-engineered growth of bone resulted in healing of large segmental bone defects in an orthotopic site in an animal model. The findings of this study support potential applications of the technique of tissue-engineered growth of bone to clinical situations where local bone formation is needed.

We have compared five methods for the measurement of thickness: (1) a Mitutoyo non-rotating thickness gauge; (2) a custom-built, instrumented thickness gauge which was strain-gauged to measure contact force; (3) a commercial Hall effect probe (Panametrics Magna-Mike); (4) a custom-built electrical resistance probe; and (5) measurement of fresh frozen histological sections under polarized light. Using bovine pericardium as a test material, all the methods examined were adequate to assess sample-to-sample and location-to-location differences in thickness. The resistance gauge gave significantly greater thicknesses than did the other methods, with little or no compression; indeed, extrapolation to zero load of thickness readings from the instrumented gauge yielded identical thickness. Thicknesses measured by frozen sections were indistinguishable from those measured with the non-rotating gauge, the instrumented gauge under 0.5-1.2 g compressive load, or the Hall effect probe. With the correct technique, the simple and inexpensive non-relating gauge remains a pragmatic choice for thickness measurement in planar soft tissue.

Using a light curing resin as a matrix gave a significantly higher modulus for a filler loading of 38% by volume, Storage in water for 29 days was found to have only a slight effect on moduli for composite systems containing in excess of 20% by volume of filler, The experimental composite systems produced slightly higher values for moduli than were predicted by the theoretical Reuss constant stress model.

The fibroblasts were cultured on 50 nm Ti-coated silicon wafers treated with radio-frequency glow discharge prior to use and on Falcon tissue culture plastic (TCP) dishes as a control. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that fibroblasts cultured on Ti reduced the fibronectin mRNA level by 58% at 16 h, but increased it by 2.6-fold at 90 h, although the cell numbers and house-keeping gene GAPD mRNA levels on these two surfaces were essentially the same. The amount of total RNA was slightly less on the Ti surface. While the total [S-35]methionine incorporation was essentially unaltered, the amount of [S-35]methionine-labeled fibronectin was significantly increased in cells cultured on a Ti surface in early cultures but decreased in the late cultures. The apparent discrepancy between the increased fibronectin mRNA levels and decreased translation could be explained by a 30% reduction in fibronectin mRNA half life in cells cultured on Ti. The distribution of fibronectin between the medium and the cell layer also was altered on Ti surfaces, with a similar to 100-fold increase of fibronectin assembled in extracellular matrix at 16 h, but a 36% reduction at 90 h. In contrast, the amount of fibronectin recovered in the medium was essentially unchanged. The total amount of protein assembled into the extracellular matrix by cells on Ti increased 2.1-fold at 16 h but decreased by 19% in 90-h cultures. These significant changes in fibronectin gene activity and gene product distribution by cells cultured on Ti surfaces demonstrate that the surface chemistry of biomaterials can selectively regulate the cellular behavior at the molecular level and, conversely, that molecular biological techniques provide sensitive indicators of the molecular biocompatibility of implant materials.

Implants of polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polypropylene prostheses were introduced into the abdominal wall of New Zea la nd rabbits. The behaviour of the biomaterials was analysed using light and scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in which a specific anti-rabbit macrophage monoclonal antibody (RAM 11) was employed. According to macroscopic observation,there was significantly fewer adhesions prosthesis-viscera to ePTFE than to polypropylene implants. After ePTFE implantation, restoration of the peritoneum took place in an orderly fashion. When polypropylene was used, the peritoneum formed was a disorderly tissue in which small areas of haemorrhage and necrosis could be seen to coincide with the appearance of adhesions. The number of labelled macrophages peaked 14 days after ePTFE or polypropylene implantation, after wh ich it decreased gradually. It is concluded that, given the low rate of adhesion provoked by PTFE, this material is ideal for im-plants contiguous to the peritoneal cavity viscera. The macrophage response does not determine the use of one material or the other.

The role of blood proteins in the pathogenesis of implant infection has been investigated, but research into the role of CSF proteins in shunt infections has not been undertaken, even though a high CSF protein has been assumed to increase the risk of such infections. Methods-New shunt catheters were exposed to either CSF or individual protein solutions, and the numbers of radiolabelled staphylococci that adhered to them were compared with controls that had been exposed to saline only. Results-A significant reduction in bacteria adhering to the test catheter was found in each instance. Furthermore, the CSF with the highest protein content, from a patient with intraventricular haemorrhage, had the greatest inhibitory effect on bacterial adhesion. The effect of the solutions on the hydrophobicity of the silicone rubber was also investigated. The silicone rubber was more hydrophilic, and bacterial adhesion was less, with solutions containing a higher protein content, and these findings were in keeping with the current theories on the mechanism of bacterial adhesion to polymers. Conclusions-A high CSF protein content does not predispose to the development of shunt infections.","GREAT ORMOND ST HOSP CHILDREN, DEPT NEUROSURG, LONDON, ENGLAND; INST CHILD HLTH, DEPT ACAD MICROBIOL, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,50,15,15,0,2,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0022-3050,1468-330X,,J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS,J.

The use of the machine does not require a chart recorder but it can be linked to a personal computer, either to show force-displacement relationships or for data storage. The design allows the use of any relatively 'soft' mechanical test, i.e. tests in which the deformability of the frame of the machine and its load cell do not introduce significant errors into the results.

Segments of length 1.2 cm were interposed between the proximal and distal stumps of transected ischiatic nerves in Wistar rats, bridging a nerve gap of 1 cm. All of the procedure was performed under general anaesthesia using microsurgical techniques. Controls were performed at 1, 3 and 6 months and it was demonstrated that the conduit was still undamaged after 30 d. Progressive signs of degradation appeared at 90 and 180 d. Nerve regeneration in the lumen was effective as confirmed by histological and electron microscopical investigations. These preliminary results emphasize the interesting properties of the conduit with regard to the achievement of a neural prosthesis.","UNIV BOLOGNA,CATTEDRA FISIOPATOL CHIRURG,BOLOGNA,ITALY; IST RIC CODIVILLA PUTTI IOR,LAB BIOL CELLULARE & MICROSCOPIA ELETTRON,BOLOGNA,ITALY; NOVAMONT SPA,NOVARA,ITALY","Aldini, NN (reprint author), IST RIC CODIVILLA PUTTI IOR,SERV CHIRURG SPERIMENTALE,BOLOGNA,ITALY.",,,,,,,16,80,82,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,959,962,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84669-2,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600002,,,,,2019-02-25

The tissue reaction evoked by films of these new biomaterials implanted into the dorsolumbar musculature of rats was assessed quantitatively using a well established technique based upon an image analysis system. The number of inflammatory cells present and the patterns of cell distribution around the implant up to a distance of 642 mu m were examined at different time periods after implantation. Since a well-delineated tissue-material interface was needed for this type of investigation, it was not possible to apply image analysis to sections once dissolution of the implanted materials had begun. Films of both the total esters, HYAFF 7 and HYAFF 11, were found to undergo a slow dissolution process and, after a month, films of these materials were still present at the site of implantation. Differences in response to the two materials were observed only during the first two weeks, particularly with respect to neutrophil distribution and total cellularity. HYAFF 7 was found to be more reactive, with higher numbers of neutrophils near the surface of the implant than HYAFF 11. Thereafter, the differences between the two materials were minimal and owing mainly to a faster dissolution of HYAFF 7 films. After 3 and 5 months, considerable degradation of films of both total esters had occurred. Significant quantities of material appeared inside numerous macrophages with an ED1-positive phenotype. Only a very thin layer of fibrous connective tissue, indicative of low reactivity, was found to surround the site of implantation, separating the dissolved material and the phagocytic cells from healthy muscular tissue. ED2-positive macrophages were primarily confined within the lining connective tissue. The partial benzyl ester, HYAFF 11p75, showed a different behaviour. In fact, evidence of film dissolution was already present a week after the implantation. After two weeks, the implanted films were completely dissolved and numerous ED1-positive macrophages phagocytosing the material were observed at the site of implantation. Therefore, in agreement with previous in vitro studies, which showed a greater susceptibility to degradation of hyaluronan derivatives with lower percentage of esterification, HYAFF 11p75 underwent resorption faster than the corresponding total ester.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND; FIDIA ADV BIOPOLYMERS SRL,I-35031 ABANO TERME,PADUA,ITALY",,,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012; Campoccia, Davide/K-5348-2018","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778; Campoccia, Davide/0000-0002-3336-0219",,,,16,55,56,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,963,975,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84670-9,,,,13,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600003,8736730.0,,,,2019-02-25

The surface-bound complement factors were detected by ellipsometry-antibody techniques. The overall complement activation was subsequently corroborated independently with enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and sheep and chicken erythrocyte haemolytic complement techniques. EIA experiments indicated elevated levels of C4d, but no significant increase of factor Bb was evident in the test serum from the MG system. The haemolytic assays show that MG surfaces consume complement factors from both pathways. Ellipsometry revealed that immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement factor 1q (C1q) are transiently antibody detectable on MG after exposure to whole serum by the use of antibody techniques. Complement factor 3 (C3), C2, C4 and properdin could be detected on the surface, but not factors H and B. The total adsorbed mass and particularly C3 antibody deposition were suppressed by using EGTA-Mg2+ serum. The results suggest that MG surfaces initially activate complement via the classical pathway.

This study examines the activation of leucocytes on a series of well-characterized polyurethanes with different ionic groups [sulphonate groups (negatively charged); quaterinary amine groups (positively charged)], in terms of adhesion, degranulation and cell surface integrin receptor expression. Leucocyte adhesion was monitored with radiolabelled neutrophils and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), degranulation by measurement of human neutrophil elastase: using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell surface expression of the integrin receptor Mac-1, using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FAGS). Our results indicate a trend towards enhanced adhesion and degranulation with respect to the negatively charged polyurethane. Similar results were observed with respect to the integrin Mac-1 from recovered adherent cells. The findings of enhanced adhesion and spreading, Mac-1 up-regulation and granulocyte elastase release from the negatively charged sulphonated polyurethane indicate the potential of leucocytes to contribute towards thrombus formation on such surfaces.","UNIV DELAWARE,DEPT CHEM ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; TEMPLE UNIV,SCH MED,SOL SHERRY THROMBOSIS RES CTR,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19140",,,,,,,,27,25,25,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,1041,1047,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84681-3,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600014,8736741.0,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of degree of lipid hydration, phospholipid chemical structure, mesophase identity, aqueous medium composition, and incident flux on the severity and progress of damage was quantified using time-resolved x-ray diffraction and chromatographic analysis of damage products. Electron spin resonance measurements of spin-trapped intermediates generated during irradiation suggest a free radical-mediated process. Surprisingly, radiation damage effects revealed by x-ray diffraction were imperceptible when the lamellar phases were prepared under water-stressed conditions, despite the fact that x-ray-induced chemical breakdown of the lipid occurred regardless of hydration level, Of the fully hydrated lipid systems studied, saturated diacyl-phosphatidylcholines were most sensitive to radiation damage compared to the ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines and the ether-linked phosphatidylcholines. The inclusion of buffers or inorganic salts in the dispersing medium had only a minor effect in reducing damage development. A small inverse dose-rate effect was found when the x-ray beam intensity was changed 15-fold. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of radiation damage, to our appreciation of the importance of monitoring both structure and composition when evaluating biomaterials radiation sensitivity, and to the development of strategies for eliminating or reducing the severity of damage due to an increasingly important source of x rays, synchrotron radiation. Because damage is shown to be free radical mediated, these results have an important bearing on age-related accumulation of free radicals in cells and how these might compromise membrane integrity, culminating in cell death.","OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,COLUMBUS,OH 43210",,,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-014646]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK36849, DK46295]",,,31,37,43,1,6,BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

A structure-bonding model of these materials is based upon Ca2+-crown ether-like coordination to the decaethylene glycol head group of one or two of the surfactant molecules. Ca2+ binding of two surfactant head groups, makes possible cis- and trans-conformations for the alkyl tails, resulting in normal and inverted structures with preferences for hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The extent of Ca2+ ion clustering in the head group determines the geometrical packing requirements of the surfactant and the overall dimensions of the resulting lamellar liquid-crystal phases.

The present study was carried out to assess the expression of IL-1 Methods. Interface tissue between the implant and bone was obtained fr om hip revision operations and was compared to healthy joint capsular tissue. Membrane bound IL-1 alpha was stained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method nod was quantified using morphometry (VIDAS image analysis system). Soluble IL-1 beta was measured by ELISA. IL-1 levels were compared to collagenase activities in the same tissue as assessed by the degradation of triple helical type I collagen monomers analyzed by SDS-PAGE/laser densitometry. Results. The IL-1 alpha staining index was high in interface tissue (7.25 +/- 1.28, p < 0.01) compared to normal joint capsular tissue (0.50 +/- 0.04). Similarly, IL-1 beta levels (ng/ml; ELISA) were high in such tissue (139.0 +/- 71.9 vs 0 +/- 0, p < 0.02). Total collagenase was higher in the interface (26.3 x 10(-6) +/- 7.57 x 10(-6) IU/l, p < 0.01) than in control tissue (0.55 x 10(-6) +/- 0.44 x 10(-6) IU/l). IL-1 alpha (r = -0.04, p > 0.05) and IL-1 beta (r = 0.25, p > 0.05) did not correlate with collagenase activity in interface tissue. Conclusion. Both IL-1 (alpha and beta) and collagenase are up-regulated around loose THR, suggesting that they may play a role in loosening. However, the correlations between IL-1 and collagenase were not significant, indicating, that IL-1 is probably not the only cytokine involved in the regulation of collagenase activity in vivo. IL-1 may also contribute to loosening by its osteoclast activating properties.","INVALID FDN, ORTON ORTHOPED HOSP, HELSINKI, FINLAND; HELSINKI UNIV, CENT HOSP, DEPT MED, HELSINKI, FINLAND; YAMAGATA UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, YAMAGATA 99023, JAPAN; TOOLO HOSP, DEPT ORTHOPED & TRAUMATOL, HELSINKI, FINLAND; UNIV OSLO, NATL HOSP, INST SURG RES, OSLO, NORWAY","Konttinen, YT (reprint author), HELSINKI UNIV, INST BIOMED, DEPT ANAT, POB 9, SILTAVUORENPENGER 20A, FIN-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,34,26,26,1,2,CLINICAL & EXPER RHEUMATOLOGY,PISA,"VIA SANTA MARIA 31, 56126 PISA, ITALY",0392-856X,,,CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL,Clin.

Many of these infections arise from an endogenous source, and their frequency is influenced by the patient population, the various treatment regimens, and the antibiotics or other supportive care measures employed at specific institutions.

In vitro ii biocompatibility tests were developed to simulate and predict biological reactions to materials when placed into or on tissues in the body. Traditional assays have measured cytotoxicity by means of either an end-stage event, (i.e., permeability of cytoplasmic membranes of dead and dying cells, or some metabolic parameter such as cell division or an enzymatic reaction). In vitro assays for initiation of inflammatory and immune reactions to materials have also begun to appear in the literature. More recently, the concept of dentin barrier tests has been introduced for dental restorative materials. Four models which measure both permeability and biological effects of materials are compared and discussed. Future efforts may be directed toward development of materials which will allow or promote function and differentiation of tissues associated with materials. New analytical procedures and understanding of optimal characteristics of materials should improve our ability to develop more biocompatible materials. Both molecular biology techniques, and altered design of material surfaces may make the materials either more or less reactive to the biological milieu. These trends suggest a greater future role of the biological sciences in the development of biomaterials.","MED COLL GEORGIA, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL REHABIL, AUGUSTA, GA 30912 USA","Hanks, CT (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH DENT 5223, DEPT ORAL MED PATHOL & SURG, 1011 N UNIV AVE, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09296],,,100,166,169,2,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

In this study, the passive oxide film formed on titanium and its natural growth in a phosphate buffered solution with and without an H2O2 addition have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements over a period of several weeks. In the absence of H2O2, the impedance response indicated a stable thin oxide film on titanium. However, the introduction of H2O2 into the solution resulted in significant changes in the EIS-spectra, which varied with exposure time. The interpretation of results is based upon a two-layer model of the oxide film, consisting of a thin barrier-type inner layer and a porous outer layer. The H2O2 addition in the solution led to a significant decrease in corrosion resistance of titanium and also to a thickening of the porous outer layer. The observations may provide an explanation of the unexpected in vivo titanium oxide growth and ion incorporation into titanium implant oxide surfaces.","SWEDISH CORROS INST,S-10405 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","Pan, J (reprint author), ROYAL INST TECHNOL,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,DR KRISTINAS VAG 51,S-10044 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,36,397,407,6,118,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0013-4686,,,ELECTROCHIM ACTA,Electrochim.

After adhering to biomaterial surfaces, other leukocyte reactions, such as phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and protease release, may occur and result in the deterioration of the implanted biomaterial and injury to peripheral tissue. This study of neutrophil adhesion quantitatively characterizes neutrophil adhesion under well-defined laminar flow conditions using a radial flow chamber. In this theologically well-defined system, the fluid shear rate on the surface varies continuously with radial position. This allows the study of shear-dependent behavior of neutrophil adhesion. Exploiting the variable shear rate in the radial flow chamber, the kinetics of neutrophil adhesion was obtained using automated video microscopy and image analysis to recursively acquire cell counts from multiple fields in different radial positions, and to quantify the surface density of neutrophil as a function of time. Neutrophil adhesion was studied on glass preadsorbed with fibrinogen and high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). At a shear rate of 20 s(-1), the number of adherent cells on the preadsorbed fibrinogen surface was similar to that on ban glass, and the number of adherent cells on the HK surface was less than 10% of that on the bare glass. We conclude that surfaces preadsorbed with HK are anti-adhesive to neutrophils.","TEMPLE UNIV,SCH MED,SOL SHERRY THROMBOSIS RES CTR,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19140","Yung, LYL (reprint author), UNIV DELAWARE,DEPT CHEM ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716, USA.",,"Yung, Lanry/B-6515-2009","Yung, Lanry/0000-0001-7579-6347","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-45486, HL-47179]",,,17,20,20,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0162-3109,,,IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY,Immunopharmacology,MAY,1996.0,32,1-3,,,,,19,23,,10.1016/0162-3109(96)00003-3,,,,5,Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,UR643,WOS:A1996UR64300006,8796260.0,,,,2019-02-25

Reconstituted type I collagen as well as sheet collagen were crosslinked in the presence of alkaline phosphatase and egg-yolk phosvitin. The crosslinked collagens were immersed in daily-renewed calcium beta-glycerophosphate solutions for 2 and 4 weeks to induce the deposition of apatite on the collagen fibers. After 2 weeks of reaction, for example, apatites deposited approximately two times the crosslinked collagen in weight. With reconstituted collagen, the complex showed some elasticity but no apatite was visually observed to detach under deformation with fingers and forceps. The complex, moreover, did not disintegrate when immersed in saline or animal blood. Nevertheless, the complex resorbed with no evidence of cytotoxity when implanted in muscle tissues. These findings suggest that the apatite-collagen complex prepared would be useful as bone substitutes, especially for periodontal osseous lesion repair and alveolar ridge augmentation.

To study the haptenic potential of these metal ions, rabbit albumin-glutathione-metal complexes with chromium, cobalt, or nickel were injected into mice. The splenocytes from one mouse in each group which developed a strong antibody against GSH-metal complexes were isolated and fused with myeloma cells to produce monoclonal antibodies. Chromium, cobalt, and nickel antibodies had similar affinity and bound with the specific GSH-metal complex. There was very little cross-reactivity between these antibodies. An inhibition assay using these monoclonal antibodies was demonstrated to be a simple technique, suitable for quantitation of free metal in solution.

Cell adhesion and proliferation on the sur faces of the polymer discs were observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. During the first 24 hours of attachment, the cells showed normal morphology when cultured on copolymers containing 1,6-bis(carboxyphenoxy)hexane. The cells did not adhere to the polymers containing sebacic acid, probably due to the rapid degradation of the polymer surfaces. Concurrently, the effects of polymer breakdown products on osteoblast-like cells were evaluated by studying their proliferation (cell numbers), viability (dye exclusion), morphology (light microscopy), and phenotypic expression. The morphology of osteoblast-like cells cultured in the presence of the polymer breakdown products pyromellitylimidoalanine and pyromellitic acid was found to be similar to that of the same cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene and consisted of a characteristic polygonal shape. With use of a monoclonal antibody to osteocalcin, these cells were shown to demonstrate preserved osteoblast phenotype with growth over a 21-day period.

In blood the adhesion and activation of platelets and leucocytes were studied by fluorescence microscopy using specific FITC-labeled antibodies or acridine orange. Intraperitoneal leucocyte adhesion was studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission microscopy, or by staining with acridine orange. The metallic surfaces were exposed to both blood and peritoneal fluid for times varying from 15 s to 4 h. The results show (a) that a significantly larger number of platelets followed by a correspondingly large number of leucocytes initially adhere to Ti rather than to Au, (b) that the rate of the inflammatory response as manifested by the appearance of leucocytes is more rapid in the peritoneal cavity than in blood, and (c) that cells attach directly to the Au surfaces while being separated by an amorphous layer on the Ti surfaces.

NR of HSA adsorbed from D2O buffer onto NH3+ terminated SAM surfaces revealed a two-layer adsorption regime. The first layer directly adjacent to the solid surface was about 40 Angstrom thick and was essentially independent of bulk liquid concentration whereas the second layer was more strongly dependent on liquid phase concentration studied, extending an additional 40 Angstrom into solution at the maximum solution concentration (0.1% wt/V). NR results are thus consistent with multilayer or mixed-layer protein adsorption mechanism and formation of an interphase region about 80 Angstrom in thickness that separates bulk solid and bulk liquid phases. By contrast, no such interphase could be resolved for an HSA solution in contact with a water-wettable SiOx surface, suggesting that HSA does not adsorb to fully-water-wettable surfaces from water. Implications of these results in biomaterials science, especially blood contact phenomena, are briefly discussed in the summary.","NIST,DIV REACTOR RADIAT,GAITHERSBURG,MD 20899; UNIV AKRON,INST POLYMER SCI,AKRON,OH 44325; BECTON DICKINSON RES CTR,POLYMER SCI & TECHNOL DEPT,RES TRIANGLE PK,NC 27709",,,,,,,,37,58,59,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,1996.0,12,9,,,,,2256,2262,,10.1021/la950642d,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,UJ056,WOS:A1996UJ05600022,,,,,2019-02-25

This will lead to a clinical infection only if several factors favour the bacterial adhesion or the bacterial coaggregation and the feeding of the bacterial biofilm, Among the many factors involved in bacterial adhesion, we focused in this paper on the physical parameters of surface hydrophobicity of the urinary catheters (Van der Waals and acido-basic forces) and the surface hydrophobicity of the bacteria (BATH and zeta potential). We also compared scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of in vivo and in vitro infected urinary catheters, We provided evidence that the more hydrophobic the bacteria, the more they are able to colonize hydrophobic materials, whereas hydrophilic cells are able to colonize hydrophilic materials more easily. Some biomaterials were found to display an irregular texture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas : they favour both types of adhesion, Moreover the divalent cations (MgII) drastically increased the bacterial coaggregation and favour bacterial growth within the biofilm. Finally, an increase in urinary pH and ionic strength increases the colonization risk. Consequently, choice of urinary catheter biomaterial is essential as patient hygiene and diet in order to avoid clinical infections.","CHRU,HOP ROBERT DEBRE,MICROBIOL LAB,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE; UFR PHARM,MICROBIOL LAB,F-51096 REIMS,FRANCE; CHRU,HOP ROBERT DEBRE,CHIRURG GEN & DIGEST,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE","Brisset, L (reprint author), UFR ODONTOL,2 RUE GEN KOENIG,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE.",,"Vernet-Garnier, Veronique/P-5729-2016",,,,,25,13,13,0,4,EXPANSION SCI FRANCAISE,PARIS,"31 BLVD LATOUR MAUBOURG, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0369-8114,,,PATHOL BIOL,Pathol.

Three types of HEMA gels were synthesized: neutral (HEMA), acidic (HEMA + acrylic acid), and basic (HEMA + dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate). Each gel was synthesized at four initial volume fractions to obtain different equilibrium swelling ratios and microstructures. Sorption as a function of time was measured for each gel at pH 7, 7.5, and 8. The rate of uptake by the acidic gels was more rapid than that by the neutral gels: To sorb 90% of the protein required only 1 h for the acidic gels but 15 days for neutral gels. Lysozyme did not adsorb or partition into the basic gels. The fractional approach to equilibrium was most rapid for the more swollen gels, and the effect of pH was small. The results reported here may be useful for rational design of new biomaterials where it is desirable to know the relative magnitude of the effects of composition, synthesis, and pH on protein sorption.

The results show that with a wavelength of 355 nm better results could be obtained with most of the matrices. The molecular weight of cytochrome c, which was separated by gel electrophoresis and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The accuracy was better than 0.1%, which is much higher than that of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The three components of protein mixture extracted from crude peanut oil was directly determined by MALDI-MS. The result also demonstrated that these proteins are in a free manner. Since these proteins are in a 2S bond, with the traditional method, SDS-PAGE, it is not possible to decide whether the proteins exist in a combination mode or in a free manner. Water-soluble polymers stained with dyes are used in the technique of two-phase aqueous solution, which is used for separating biomaterials.

Cross-linking using EDC involves the activation of carboxylic acid groups to give O-acylisourea groups, which form cross-links after reaction with free amine groups. Treatment of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with EDC (E-DSC) resulted in materials with an increased shrinkage temperature (T-s) and a decreased free amine group content, showing that cross-linking occurred. Addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide to the EDC-containing cross-linking solution (E/N-DSC) increased the rate of cross-linking. Cross-linking increased the T-s of non-cross-linked DSC samples from 56 to 73 degrees C for E-DSC and to 86 degrees C for E/N-DSC samples, respectively. For both cross-linking methods a linear relation between the decrease in free amine group content and the increase in T-s was observed. The tensile strength and the high strain modulus of E/N-DSC samples decreased upon cross-linking from 18 to 15 MPa and from 26 to 16 MPa, respectively.

Ch6SO(4) incorporated into collagen gels stimulated cell growth rate, but the effect was found to be inconsistent. We found that approximately 50% of the incorporated Ch6SO(4) in the gels leached out into the growth medium after the first 3 d in culture, and this is thought to lead to the inconsistent cell growth response. In order to minimize the elution of Ch6SO(4) from the gels and thereby maximize its effect on the growth of the keratinocytes, 1-100 mu g ml(-1) Ch6SO(4) was added in the medium. The results showed that Ch6SO(4) at these concentrations in the medium did not stimulate the cell growth on either plain collagen gels or gels containing 20% Ch6SO(4). As an alternative strategy, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and diamines (putrescine or diaminohexane) were used to immobilize Ch6SO(4) onto the collagen gels and to cross-link the gels. The cross-linking process partially prevented the elution of Ch6SO(4) from the gels. Interestingly, only putrescine, not diaminohexane, promoted the growth of keratinocytes on the cross-linked plain collagen gels. We proposed to develop an artificial skin substitute containing putrescine as a growth factor for the human epidermal cells.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; GLASGOW ROYAL INFIRM,BURNS UNIT,GLASGOW,LANARK,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,35,49,49,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,APR,1996.0,17,8,,,,,775,780,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)81414-1,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UE609,WOS:A1996UE60900004,8730961.0,,,,2019-02-25

The specimens were exposed for 7 and 28 days at 37 degrees C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. One set of experiments was carried out at 60 degrees C to determine the effect of temperature on the film stability. Environmental exposure had little direct effect on the film properties, but the fluids tended to degrade the interfacial adhesion when penetration to the interface was possible. This can occur via microscopic penetrations in the film or via the edges. The buffered saline solution appeared to be the most aggressive in this respect.

Our previous studies showed functional differentiated cells and collagen synthesis in the pore of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene implant. This study identifies and quantifies collagen types synthesized in the implant. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene polymers were implanted in the rabbit corneas. The collagen extracted from the polymer and implanted stroma after 1, 3 and 6 months was quantified by measuring hydroxyproline. The relative proportions of collagen types were determined by densitometric analysis after SDS-PAGE. The collagen-to-protein ratio in the polymer increased from 0.22 to 0.70 between the first and third month after implantation becoming similar to control cornea. So that of the protein and collagen densities in the polymer and implanted stroma were similar to the control from the third month. The collagen synthesized in the polymer was mainly type I (87%) plus a small amount of type III (8%) 1 month after implantation. The collagen distribution from the third month after implantation was similar to that of the controls and remained constant thereafter in the polymer implant and in the implanted stroma. Immunogold labelling techniques confirmed these results. Implantation of this PTFE disc induced no obvious modification of the corneal stroma, confirming that this polymer is a good interface that is compatible with the native corneal stroma. The keratocytes in this polymer rapidly adopted a corneal phenotype, distinct from the dermal or scaring phenotype as shown by the collagen types produced in the implant.

Before the advent of modern hemorheology in the 70s, studies were mainly focussed on microcirculation and validation of global hemorheological equations applied to blood circulation. Parallel studies on the microrheological properties (erythrocyte deformability and aggregation) explained analytically the non-Newtonian behavior of blood, and the essential contribution of these parameters to the understanding hyperviscosity syndromes. The development of clinical hemorheology in fact started at the international conferences held in Reykjavik (1966) and Heidelberg (1969), and with the initiation of the periodical European Microcirculation (since Nancy in 1960) and Clinical Hemorheology (since Nancy in 1979) Conferences. The current main avenues of research involve flow modelling, studies of cell-cell interaction mechanisms (aggregation and adhesion), in relation to the associated pathophysiological phenomena, such as cellular activation (platelets and leukocytes in particular), gene expression linked to blood flow (e.g. endothelial cells)... Clinically and therapeutically, it is crucial that pathophysiological studies be undertaken on the relationship existing between theological parameters and objective clinical data (local flow rates, ischemic markers, hemostatic parameters, tissue oxygen, clinical symptoms,...). The main clinical application fields are cardiovascular diseases, thrombosis, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia... Also, studies on new therapeutics or on biomaterials should also be given priority (J Mal Vasc 1996; 21 : pages 7-15).",,"Stoltz, JF (reprint author), FAC MED,DEPT HEMATOL EA1728,PLATEAU BRABOIS,F-54500 VANDOEUVRE NANCY,FRANCE.",,,,,,,138,3,3,0,2,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0398-0499,,,J MAL VASCUL,J.

This process is generally amplified in pathologic states as atherosclerosis. Atheroma originates from smooth muscle cells (SMC) which have migrated and proliferated in the vascular intima. In this study we investigated protein synthesis, collagen synthesis, and types I, Ill, and V collagen distribution by SMC in the presence of three families of water-soluble polysaccharides, heparin, fucans, and derivatized dextrans. We observed that fucan and derivatized dextran were able, as was heparin, to inhibit rat aortic SMC growth in culture. We then analyzed collagen modulation by measuring the incorporation of the radiolabeled precursor (H-3)-proline into vascular SMC. Our results showed uncoupling of the antiproliferative capacity with collagen biosynthesis. However, fucan, the most antiproliferative polysaccharide, was also the most active in inhibiting protein and collagen synthesis. In addition, compounds that decreased total collagen synthesis preferentially increased the proportion of cell-associated collagen. Interestingly, only the antiproliferative polysaccharides inhibited significantly type V collagen biosynthesis. These new biomaterials appear to be valuable tools to study and control extracellular-matrix interactions with cells from the vascular walls.

The method, termed GESFIDE (gradient-echo sampling of FID and echo) is based on sampling the descending and ascending portions of a Hahn echo with a train of gradient echoes. R(2) and R(2)' are computed by exploiting the differential evolution of the transverse magnetization before and after the phase-reversal pulse. Salient features of the method are its insensitivity to RF pulse imperfections and its high precision and efficiency.

The rate of their biodegradation can be reduced by treating them with different cross-linking agents. The efficiency of different reticulation procedures on thermal stability (measured by differential scanning calorimetry) and susceptibility to bacterial collagenase digestion of the final material (films or sponges) is compared. The chemical agents used on collagen gels or directly on collagen sponges and films were glutaraldehyde (GTA), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDC), cya nam ide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and the two acyl azide methods (with hydrazine or diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA)) developed in the authors' laboratory. Under these experimental conditions, collagen stabilization by the different agents increased in the following order: cyanamide < EDC < HMDC < hydrazine < DPPA < GTA. Sponges with the highest thermal stability were obtained by treating collagen gel with 0.5% GTA for 1 h at pH 5.5 (initial T-d = 75.8 degrees C; after 3 months, T-d = 75.6 degrees C). Direct treatment of collagen films with DPPA gave similar thermal stability (T-d = 72.6 degrees C) and collagenase resistance when compared with treatment with 0.6% GTA for 96 h (T-d = 74.6 degrees C). It is demonstrated that collagen sponges and films can be prepared with a wide range of thermal stability (49-75.8 degrees C) and collagenase digestion resistance (10-100%). Recent biocompatibility studies show, however, that DPPA and EDC are the best choices for preparing cross-linked collagen sponges and films.","INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS UPR 412,F-69367 LYON 7,FRANCE; COLET,LYON,FRANCE",,,,,,,,25,164,171,0,35,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

A deprotonation of the amine groups of adsorbed peptides was also observed, revealing a possibly chemical interaction with the mineral surface. Simultaneously a decrease of the Ca/P ratio of the mineral surface occurred.

Providing a comprehensive characterization of polymer blend surfaces requires a multi-instrumental approach, as no individual surface analysis technique can ascertain both the chemical and morphological nature of surfaces. In this study we have characterized the surfaces of immiscible and miscible blends of the biodegradable polymers poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA) using the surface techniques of static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SSIMS and XPS have recorded the surface enrichment of all of the blends with the PLA component. For the immiscible blends, differential charging within the XPS spectra also provides evidence of phase separation. AFM data have contrasted the surface morphologies of the immiscible and miscible blends, and the use of in situ AFM techniques has enabled the effect of blend morphology on surface erosion to be visualized. For the immiscible systems, clear phase separation morphologies can be observed and at certain blend compositions the rapid loss of the PSA from the films results in the exposure of the PLA morphology. However, as the PLA content is increased, the surface enrichment effect results in the degradation behavior of the blend being dominated by the slow degrading PLA surface layer. For the miscible systems, the in situ AFM studies visualized a disintegration of the whole blend film without the exposure of a PLA morphology, indicating that the hydrolysis of the PSA component rendered the whole film unstable. The use of SIMS, XPS, and AFM, while highlighting the complexity of polymer blend surfaces, can provide a rapid analysis of the physicochemical phenomena underlying the organization of these systems and therefore should facilitate the application of such systems as biomaterials.",,"Davies, MC (reprint author), UNIV NOTTINGHAM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,LAB BIOPHYS & SURFACE ANAL,UNIV PK,NOTTINGHAM NG7 2RD,ENGLAND.",,"Shard, Alexander/B-4530-2010; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009; Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009","Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596; Shard, Alexander/0000-0002-8931-5740; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439",,,,44,79,80,0,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,MAR 11,1996.0,29,6,,,,,2205,2212,,10.1021/ma950889h,,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,UA294,WOS:A1996UA29400049,,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of chemical treatment with amino acids is assessed in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats. Pericardial tissue from young calves was treated with L-lysine, L-glutamine, L-arginine or L-glutamic acid, each at a concentration of 0.5 M, following treatment with 0.625% glutaraldehyde. Then, the tissue was implanted into young rats for periods of 21 and 60 d, after which the calcium accumulated was quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Values similar to or higher than those found in control samples indicated a lack of effectiveness of these treatments. Only in the 21-d implantation samples treated with L-lysine and L-arginine was less calcium accumulated than in the control tissue. After 60 d of implantation, all groups showed high levels of calcium deposition. The values obtained after 60 d of subcutaneous implantation were 87.5 +/- 52.4 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-lysine, 108.7 +/- 43.5 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-glutamine, 130.4 +/- 22.4 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-glutamic acid, 119.3 +/- 27.6 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-arginine and 100.0 +/- 38.3 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for the control group.

The intraabdominal pressure is mainly influenced by the activity of the transverse muscles. The abdominal fascia of corpses withstands forces of 60-80 N/cm in horizontal and 20-30 N/cm in vertical direction; tearing of sutures occurs below 30 N/cm in horizontal direction. Assuming the abdominal cavity to be a thin hollow sphere, the rupture forces are approximatly 4-16 N/cm for a diameter of 8-32 cm. The meshes currently in use are much stronger than this, rupturing at 40-100 N/cm. The curvature of the abdominal surface can be measured by 3D-photogrammetry and is highly significantly reduced following mesh implantation (t-test, 2-sided, P < 0.01). Reduction of the mesh material can decrease the rate of local wound complications and the stiffness of the abdominal wall.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,AERODYNAM INST,W-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY; MED STATE UNIV,RES CTR,MOSCOW,RUSSIA","Klinge, U (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,CHIRURG KLIN,PAUWELSSTR 30,D-52057 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,"Oettinger, Alexander/G-8594-2014","Oettinger, Alexander/0000-0001-9894-0671",,,,12,78,83,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0009-4722,,,CHIRURG,Chirurg,MAR,1996.0,67,3,,,,,229,233,,,,,,5,Surgery,Surgery,UD763,WOS:A1996UD76300004,8681695.0,,,,2019-02-25

Thin sheets (250 mu m) of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene were cut into pieces measuring either 2x2, 2x4, 2x8, or 4x8 mm. The pieces were sterilized and placed individually within surgically prepared pockets in the sclera of rabbit eyes. Animals were sacrificed for routine histopathologic evaluation and transmission electron microscopic study of the eyes at 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, and 4 months following surgical implantation. The implants demonstrated excellent compatibility with the sclera and, by 14 days following implantation surgery, exhibited histiocytes, fibroblasts, and blood vessels infiltrating the internodal spaces of the highly porous material. The number of cells and the amount of extracellular matrix material deposited in the implants appeared to increase with time. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed deposition of collagen within the implants. Our results suggest that expanded polytetrafluoroethylene has potential for use in the development of a sclera-attached prosthetic device.","UNIV SO CALIF, SCH MED, DEPT OPHTHALMOL, LOS ANGELES, CA 90033 USA",,,,,NEI NIH HHS [EY03040],,,30,7,9,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0277-3740,1536-4798,,CORNEA,Cornea,MAR,1996.0,15,2,,,,,210,214,,10.1097/00003226-199603000-00016,,,,5,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,TW399,WOS:A1996TW39900016,8925671.0,,,,2019-02-25

In this study, human keratinocytes were cultured on the surface of collagen sponges, and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to assess both the microstructure of the sponge, and the cell morphology and distribution throughout the sponge. It was found that the pore size increased with increasing depth into the sponge. Both pore size and fiber thickness increased during incubation for up to 10 days at 37 degrees C in culture medium in the absence of cells. This latter effect was not observed when the sponges were incubated in distilled water. Keratinocytes penetrated into the sponge even after only 3 days in culture. By 10 days in culture, the cells had penetrated to the maximum depth that could be examined (120 mu m from the sponge surface). In the presence of cells, the inner structure of the collagen sponge had altered after 10 days in culture, with the collagen fibers becoming thicker, and pore geometry less regular. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown at present. Although the presence of the keratinocytes increases distortion of the sponge structure, factors from the medium itself also contribute to this effect. CLSM is a powerful tool for assessing cellular interactions with bioimplants, providing both qualitative and quantitative information. It offers many advantages over scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological techniques. CLSM minimizes the time-consuming, extensive preparation of samples required with the latter two methods, and allows noninvasive serial optical sectioning of intact samples.

We previously developed a biocompatible dermal sheep collagen (DSC), which in an abdominal wall reconstruction model showed controlled biodegradation and functioned as a matrix for ingrowth of fibroblasts but not of muscle. It was hypothesized that regeneration of muscle via DSC may be possible by seeding of muscle cells. Using a syringe, mouse C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in DSC disks and incubated in methylcellulose-based growth medium, changed at 24 h into differentiation medium. An estimated 85% of the cells were well distributed, especially in the top half of the DSC disks. Some 15% of the cells ended up on top. At 4 h, all cells showed a spherical morphology, sometimes with clear adhesion plaques. At 24 h, cells on the top started to form a ''capsule'' with well-spread cells. Underneath the capsule, of the remaining 85% of the cells, approximately 30% showed adhesion and spreading on/in between collagen bundles. At day 3 after the addition of differentiation medium, the spread cells showed first indications of myotube formation. At day 7, myotube formation had proceeded, while extracellular matrix, i.e., collagen and elastin, had been deposited. This study shows that myoblast seeding into DSC is feasible, resulting in a reasonable cell distribution and survival of 45% of the cells. The surviving cells are able to differentiate into myotubes and form an extracellular matrix.

Bacteria washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) adhered to polymers in amounts nearly twice those of bacteria that were left in their growth medium, tryptic soy broth (TSB). In TSB, there was variation in adhesion from species to species, but no significant variation from polymer to polymer within one species. In PBS there were significant differences in the amounts of bacteria adhering to the various polymers with the exception of S. epidermidis, which had similar adhesion to all polymers. As a whole, P. aeruginosa was the most adherent while S. epidermidis was the least adherent. The estimated values of the free energy of adhesion (Delta F-adh) correlated with the amount of adherent P. aeruginosa. When POE, PLA, and PSF were exposed to hyaluronic acid (HA) before exposure to the bacteria, there was 50% more adhesion of E. coli and P. aeruginosa on POE and PLA.

Because implant surfaces spontaneously adsorb host proteins, this proteinaceous film is probably important in the subsequent attraction of phagocytes. In fact, earlier we found that acute inflammatory responses to experimental polyethylene terephthalate implants in mice require the precedent adsorption of one particular host protein, fibrinogen. The present investigations were aimed at defining the molecular determinants of fibrinogen-mediated acute inflammatory responses to implanted biomaterials. We find: (a) plasmin degradation of purified fibrinogen into defined domains reveals that the proinflammatory activity resides within the D fragment, which contains neither the fibrin cross-linking sites nor RGD sequences; (b) the major (and, perhaps, exclusive) proinflammatory sequence appears to be fibrinogen gamma 190-202, previously shown to interact with CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1). The chemically synthesized peptide, cross-linked to albumin (which itself does not promote inflammatory responses), mimics the proinflammatory effect of adsorbed native fibrinogen; and (c) this sequence probably promotes inflammatory responses through interactions with Mac-1 because phagocyte accumulation on experimental implants is almost completely abrogated by administration of recombinant neutrophil inhibitory factor (which blocks CD11b-fibrin(ogen) interaction). We conclude that improved knowledge of such surface-protein-phagocyte interactions may permit the future development of more biocompatible implantable materials.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EMERGENCY PATHOL A 81, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA; CLEVELAND CLIN FDN, CTR THROMBOSIS & VASC BIOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44195 USA",,,,,,,,53,160,161,0,22,AMER SOC CLINICAL INVESTIGATION INC,ANN ARBOR,"2015 MANCHESTER RD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48104 USA",0021-9738,1558-8238,,J CLIN INVEST,J.

The specimens were analyzed two and four weeks later for their calcium content. Results: Over time untreated GBP and GlyBP calcified in vitro and in vivo while GPV retained low calcium levels in vivo. Surface seeding with rat fibrocytes significantly reduced the calcium accumulation in GBP and GlyBP in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05).

Defects that cannot be satisfactorily treated by complicated and costly reconstructive techniques reveal a need for an alloplastic tracheal replacement. Recent experimental and clinical studies in the development of alloplastic tracheal prostheses proved that the lack of an epithelial lining on the luminal surfaces and inadequate biophysical properties and shapes of the prostheses were the main causes for failure of these prostheses. In this study a cell-seeding technique has been used. Adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of seeded mucosa cells on biomaterials in vitro were observed by scanning election microscopy (SEM). Chemical properties and surface structure of the material influenced the differentiation process. Epithelium formation of incorporated tracheal prostheses was tested in animal experiments. Isolated respiratory cells were seeded into implanted tubular prostheses of porous polyurethane or expanded polytetrafluorethylene. Light microscopy and SEM showed the tendency of epithelium formation on the surface of the lumen. Vigorous cell layers, predominantly as multiple cell layers of squamous epithelium, were observed. Ciliated or mucus cells were not detected. It can be stated that the epithelium formation on incorporated porous implants is possible. Further studies of the stability and the differentiation process of the epithelium on such implants is needed before an introduction of tracheal replacements into the clinical practice can be considered.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,OTORHINOLARYNGOL CLIN,CHARITE HOSP,BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,DERMATOL CLIN,CHARITE HOSP,BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,INST ANAT,BERLIN,GERMANY; INST TEXT RES & CHEM ENGN,DENKENDORF,GERMANY",,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Filling a defect by the application of autogenous bone is one of them. Autogenous cancellous bone is still considered to be the gold standard, but numerous shortcomings of this material, described in detail in the paper, are not taken into account. Besides, we are still unable to influence bone healing by the transplantation of autogenous bone with reference to quality, quantity of newly forming bone and the time period, in which bone healing occurs. Investigation into the different kinds of biomaterial developed to replace autogenous bone as a transplant, and their implantation into experimental animals did not result in the production of a synthetic material that was: as active as autogenous or even allogeneic cancellous bone. This was therefore not a solution to the problem. The reasons for this are multiple and are discussed in this paper. We developed a classification for bone replacement materials that differentiates between biological, synthetic, and composed materials, i.e., composite biomaterials made for bone replacement. In reference to the literature, as well as our own results, based on the implantation of more than 1200 rats, dogs and sheep with distinct materials, the plus/minus effects of the different classes, groups and subgroups of bone replacement materials are summarized and discussed. The most recent knowledge about the mechanisms of bone formation and how it is influenced by different growth factors, as well as bioactive ceramics, indicates that in the future an applicable bone replacement material will be a composite of a carrier material combined with chemotactic, inductive, morphogenetic and proliferative, chemically pure, recombinant factors, with a mainly local action.

Our laboratory has developed a method of impregnating biomaterials with suspensions containing bioactive proteins resulting in the capability of differentially modulating EC and SMC growth in vitro and in vivo following implantation. We have previously reported that 60 mu internodal distance ePTFE grafts impregnated with fibrin glue (FG) containing FGF-1 and heparin develop confluent endothelialization with transiently increased EC and SMC proliferation after 4 weeks in dogs. Thoraco-abdominal implants after 20 weeks were developed significantly thicker (139 mu) inner capsules in response to the FGF. To minimize SMC proliferation we studied the effects of FGF-1, heparin, and thrombin concentrations on SMC growth in vitro. FG caused a 182% increase (P < 0.001) in DNA synthesis. Heparin within FG diminished this effect in a dose-dependant manner, with complete inhibition of FG-induced growth at 500 U ml(-1) (versus FG alone, P < 0.001). FGF-1 within FG without heparin had no effect, but together, FGF-1 caused a dose-dependant growth increase while increasing heparin concentrations initially increased and then decreased proliferation. FGF-1 and heparin in the medium of quiescent SMCs had similar effects. Only thrombin concentrations > 3.2 U ml(-1) stimulated SMC growth and this stimulation was blocked by heparin. A synergism between FGF and heparin on EC proliferation was also found but without EC growth inhibition in response to higher concentrations of heparin. It is thus possible to modulate the relative proliferative activity of ECs versus SMCs by altering the FGF:heparin ratio. This same system may be useful with other proteins to induce other local affects by the applied protein or systemic affects following release of that protein.","EDWARD HINES JR VET ADM HOSP,HINES,IL 60141; ST BARNABAS HOSP,LIVINGSTON,NJ 07039","Greisler, HP (reprint author), LOYOLA UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT SURG,2160 S 1ST AVE,MAYWOOD,IL 60153, USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL41272, R01 HL29268]",,,15,65,69,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1996.0,17,3,,,,,329,336,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)85571-2,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,TY459,WOS:A1996TY45900012,8745330.0,,,,2019-02-25

A number of extensively used polymeric biomaterials (i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) and its copolymers with a series of acrylic monomers- acrylic acid and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate- polyetherurethane and polypropylene (PP)) was prepared by using suitable polymerization methods. Their surface structures were characterized by wettability and surface free energy measurements, scanning electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. It was found that these surfaces have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.0 erg cm(-2) with different charge and charge densities. The adherence of two strains of Escherichia coli (non-pathogen and pathogen) isolated from indigenous flora of trachea and pathogen flora of urethral surfaces, and uropathogenic Candida albicans to the polymeric surfaces was studied in vitro by means of microscopic techniques. The hydrophobicity of cell surfaces was determined by using two methods including adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements. The uropathogenic E. coli and C. albicans were found to be relatively hydrophobic with a similar surface free energy, approximately 40 erg cm(-2), when compared with normal E. coli strain which has 61 erg cm(-2) free energy. The uropathogenic strains were poorly adherent to hydrophilic polymer surfaces while showing excellent adherence on hydrophobic PP surfaces.

For analytical purposes, characterization using megaelectron-volt He2+ ions provides a standardless, nondestructive means for accurately quantifying the composition of material surfaces and the thickness of thin films. In this study, three complementary ion backscattering techniques were utilized to characterize hydroxyapatite (HA) films: Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) can determine composition and amounts of elements heavier than He; forward recoil elastic spectrometry (FRES) can determine hydrogen content; resonance-enhanced RBS can quantify small amounts of light elements, e.g. carbon, by choosing a particular incident beam energy resulting in excitation of the light element nucleus. At this resonance energy, the scattering cross section greatly incsreases, improving elemental sensitivity. Sol-gel chemistry was used to synthesize HA films by spin coating and annealing in a rapid thermal processor. Using these techniques, the chemical composition of unfired films was Ca1.63O5.4H1.8C0.24P with a thickness of 3.01 x 10(18) atoms/cm(2) and after firing at 800 degrees C as Ca1.66O4.0H0.26C0.09P with a thickness of 2.11 x 10(18) atoms/cm(2).

Two commercial polymers: polyethylene (PE) and silicone rubber (SR) and two laboratory-synthesized polyurethanes were examined. The polyurethanes studied consisted of a polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO)-based polyurethane (PEU-base) and a sulfonated polyurethane (PEU-S03). in vitro polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion and respiratory burst activity measurements were studied using a radiolabelling technique and a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, respectively. An increased number of adherent PMNs and increased cell spreading were found on PEU-S03 compared to the PEU-base, SR and PE. The largest CL response was also found on PEU-SO3, whereas on the other hydrophobic polymers the response was smaller. Additionally, on the PEU-SO3 surface the CL response was sustained indicating more prolonged production of oxygen radicals by PMNs on this material. Upon stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OZ), the PMNs on PEU-S03 showed the lowest CL response, indicating a decreased respiratory burst activity. The other hydrophobic surfaces, PE, SR and PEU-base, showed no significant differences among them in their CL response. The residual CL response was reduced by 30% for PEU-SO3 and by 10-15% for PE, SR and PEU-base compared to the control (luminometer polystyrene cuvette only, no disc). Upon addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), all surfaces except SR showed a slightly reduced CL response. Along with PE, PEU-S03 showed the lowest CL response. These results suggest that oxygen radicals are produced during early incubation of PMNs with biomaterials, and upon subsequent stimulation of these cells, fewer oxygen radicals are produced due to cellular exhaustion.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,,,,43,9,10,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

A wide variety of materials has been used for these implants, but only a few promote osseointegration and biointegration. Titanium and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) have been the most widely used of these materials. The surface oxide of titanium appears to be central to the ability of this material to osseointegrate. The oxide limits dissolution of elements and promotes the deposition of biological molecules which allow bone to exist as close as 30 Angstrom to the surface of the implant. The details of the ultrastructure of the gap between the implant and bone remain undefined, and the consequences of elements which are released on the interface over time are not known. These areas of investigation are particularly important in defining the differences between commercially pure titanium implants and those made of titanium, aluminium and vanadium. The epithelial interface between the gingiva and titanium appears to contain many of the structural characteristics of the native tooth-gingiva interface, but details are still vague. The connective tissue interface with the titanium appears to be one of tightly fitting tissues rather than adhesion. Ceramic coatings appear to improve the ingrowth of bone and promote chemical integration of the implant with the bone. The characteristics of these coatings are complex and affect the bony response, but the mechanisms remain obscure. The degradation of the coatings is an issue of particular controversy. Progress in dental implantology is likely to continue as the interface between the material and bone is more clearly understood, and biological molecules and artificial tissues are developed.",,"Wataha, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL REHABIL, AUGUSTA, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,63,37,39,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The properties and overall integrity of mineralized tissues are in part dictated by the nature of their interfaces-sites where organic and inorganic components of the extracellular matrix interact to provide biomechanical strength, regulate mineral ion homeostasis, and influence cellular events involved in mineralized tissue modeling, remodeling, and repair. High-resolution, colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry has been used to characterize the proteinaceous composition of these interfaces and to establish that the phosphorylated sialoprotein, OPN, is a major component found at these sites where it accumulates as a dense, planar ''coating'' of organic material termed either a cement line or a lamina limitans. Structural/functional features of OPN predict an ability of this protein to regulate calcification in the matrix proper of mineralized tissues and to participate, more specifically, in cell-matrix and matrix-matrix/mineral adhesion in laminae limitantes and cement lines, respectively. From the ultrastructural immunocytochemical data presented herein for OPN illustrating the cellular expression and extracellular matrix distribution of this protein, it is demonstrated that the production of OPN is one of the earliest, and latest, secretory activities of the osteoblast lineage and that this activity manifests itself morphologically as a cement line or a lamina limitans, respectively, at bone matrix interfaces. In laminae limitantes at bone surfaces, OPN appears to be involved in osteoclast adhesion and possibly haptotaxis. An OPN-containing cement line is also present at hard tissue interfaces in rat tooth, against osseointegrated titanium and hydroxyapatite implants and at the margins of surgically created bone defects-and there may influence biological adhesion in a manner similar to that proposed for normal bone. It is suggested, therefore, that in addition to its potential for influencing cell adhesion/dynamics in bones and teeth, OPN in cement lines may act as an interfacial adhesion promoter between apposing substrates, therein maintaining the overall integrity of bone during the bone remodeling sequence and ''bonding'' dissimilar tissues (or biocompatible materials) together in biological composites such as teeth and osseointegrated implants.

Using an open surgical procedure, 23 double-J stents of 8 different types were inserted in the ureters of 13 piglets. After 6 weeks intubation, 2 (9%) of the 23 stented renal units yielded positive urine culture. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed sporadic bacteria on 7 (30%) of the 23 indwelling ureteric stents and bacterial biofilms on only 2 (9%), those indwelling the renal units which yielded positive urine cultures. Precut segments of the 8 double-J stent brands were incubated with 5 different bacterial strains. Microbiological and SEM analysis of the stents revealed that only 0.1-0.01% of the bacterial inoculum adhered to the stents. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial adherence to the various stent materials. Interestingly, the two Escherichia coli strains with P-fimbriae adhered significantly more than the two without P-fimbriae. Sporadic bacterial adhesion to ureteric stents seemed to have little clinical significance whereas biofilm formation seemed to result in urinary tract infection. None of the tested stents proved to be superior to the others in this respect, and adhesion appeared to depend on the virulence of the bacteria rather than the properties of the biomaterials.","HELSINKI UNIV,CENT HOSP,DEPT SURG 4,HELSINKI,FINLAND; HELSINKI UNIV,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; PAIJAT HAME CENT HOSP,DEPT SURG,UROL UNIT,LAHTI,FINLAND; UNIV BARI,SCH MED,BARI,ITALY",,,,,,,,21,28,28,0,8,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0036-5599,,,SCAND J UROL NEPHROL,Scand.

In this study, a new attempt was made to coat bioactive glasses on Ti-6A1-4V by plasma spraying. This method will coat the bioactive glass coatings (BGCs) onto metal substrate, potentially combining the excellent mechanical strength of metal and biocompatibility of bioactive glass. Analysis by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the BGCs, revealed that the amorphous structure of glass was preserved. BGCs were soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF) to evaluate their properties in vitro. After soaking in SBF for 1 day, precipitation of fiber structure was observed on the surface of the BGCs. After 2 and more days, the surface of the BGCs was completely covered with precipitates. The precipitates, identified as the apatite phase by XRD, contained carbonate and hydroxyl functional groups detected by Fourier transform IR reflection (FTIR) spectroscopy. After soaking for 16 days, a thin layer of about 10 FM, rich in calcium and phosphorus but poor in silicon, was observed on the surface of the BGCs. The composition of the Ca-P rich layer was consistent with the apatite structure identified by various methods, but the apatite layer was significantly thicker than reported in bulk form. The formation of an apatite phase surface has been suggested to be indicative of biocompatibility. All findings in this study indicated the formation of apatite on the surface of plasma-sprayed BGCs, and this material is expected to be biocompatible in vivo.","NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,TAINAN,TAIWAN; NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,CTR MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAINAN,TAIWAN",,,"Lee, Tzer-Min/G-3713-2011",,,,,31,35,39,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0257-8972,,,SURF COAT TECH,Surf.

The MEOnPC could polymerize with n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) in ethanol using a conventional radical polymerization technique. The unit mole fraction of MEOnPC in the polymer corresponded to that in the feed monomer solution. The MEOnPC polymers were soluble in ethanol, insoluble in water, but swelled in water and became hydrated. On the surface of a poly(BMA) membrane coated with MEOnPC, the phosphorylcholine groups of the MEOnPC unit present were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a fundamental evaluation for biomedical materials, adsorption of one of the plasma proteins, fibrinogen, on acrylic beads coated with the MEOnPC polymers was evaluated. The amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on the MEOnPC polymer was smaller than that on the original acrylic beads, poly(BMA) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The increase in the MEOnPC unit mole fraction in the polymer showed more effective protein adsorption-resistant properties.

The interface in all animals consisted of collagenous tissue. The amount of collagenous fibres was related to the amount of residual movement within the motion segment: animals undergoing anterior plating after reconstruction of the bone defect presented with more or less compactly organized collagenous tissue. Sequential fluorochromic marking of osteoid formation revealed a vital bone bed around the interface but no signs of direct bone apposition to the ionomer cement plug.

The poly (beta-hydroxybutyrate-beta-hydroxyvalerate), a biopolymer considered as being biodegradable and biocompatible, has been recently introduced for orthopaedic biomaterials and regeneration pur poses. In our study, a PHB/9% HV polymer was transformed into 3D foams, then applied to the culture 3D of ovine chondrocytes (fibrous rings & growth plates) and osteoblasts (periostum). Sponges made ofbovine type I collagen were used as references. Orthopaedic cells were isolated, prepared and sown by simple injection to the geometrical center of the substrata, then incubated from 0 to 35 days by changing the culture medium all 4 days. Maximal densities were reached after 21 days: 18-24.10(6) cells/g for the chondrocytes, 8-10.10(6) cells/g for the osteoblasts. The cellular proliferation was more marked, with highest cell densities, for the collagen sponges. Laser confocal microscopy shows that the cellular diffusion take place throughout the entire volume of the porous artificial substrata. Future studies will allow to apply the porous bioabsorbable substrata to high-density cell cultures, to the tissue engineering and regeneration, for example for orthopaedic tissues: cartilage, fibrocartilage and bone.",,"Rivard, CH (reprint author), HOP ST JUSTINE, CTR RECH PEDIAT, LAB BIOMECAN ORTHOPED, 3175 CHEMIN COTE ST CATHERINE, MONTREAL, PQ H3T 1C5, CANADA.",,,,,,,34,56,63,0,8,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX,"65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE",0003-3944,,,ANN CHIR,Ann.

In 1991, Allegheny General Hospital and Allegheny-Singer Research Institute purchased a centrifugal pump, then a 2-year-old technology, from Medtronic Bio-Medicus, as part of its research program for novel treatments of acute and chronic heart failure. During a 4-year development program, we then established and met goals of durability, performance, thromboresistance, and low cost. Methods. In vitro testing involved extensive hydraulic characterizations using Penn State mock loops. Calorimetry was used to determine efficiency. Durability studies used heated (37 degrees C) seawater for 28 to 45 days. In vivo studies used 46 sheep to test performance and engineering changes and to determine myocardial oxygen consumption, thromboresistance, and long-term durability. A left atrium-to-aorta circuit was used in all. Results. Hydraulic testing showed no preload sensitivity but moderate afterload sensitivity at all impeller speeds (2,000 to 6,000 rpm). The heat load was low, and overall efficiency was 13% to 15%. Bench durability studies showed no electrical malfunction of the stator or console without degradation of the biomaterials used. Acute in vitro studies showed a near-linear relationship of myocardial oxygen consumption and left ventricular stroke work, pump now, and pump speed. At speeds of 2 to 3 L/min (50% bypass), left ventricular stroke work and myocardial oxygen consumption were decreased approximately 50%. Additionally, 5 animals have had implants for 28 to 154 days with no macroemboli or microemboli detected in any animal.

In a clinical setting, endothelialization of a graft can be achieved using higher cell seeding densities, or by creating a surface on which EC can adhere and grow to confluence. But, human endothelial cells show little or no proliferation on the currently available graft materials. In this study, surface modification of PTFE and ePTFE by ammonia plasma treatment was carried out to enhance its interactions with ECM protein, EC growth factors, and with EC harvested from human umbilical vein (HUVEC), and from human saphenous veins (HSVEC). Our data shows that various vascular graft materials generated from ammonia plasma treated PTFE and ePTFE exhibited statistically significant improvements in HUVEC and HSVEC growth when compared to their respective controls (p values < 0.001). Growth of HSVEC on ammonia plasma treated ePTFE without ECM protein coating was also found to be statistically significant in comparison to that on fibronectin coated ePTFE (p < 0.001). The final HSVEC cell densities found on various ePTFE surfaces prepared from ammonia plasma treated ePTFE, suggests that transplantation of HSVEC monolayers on vascular prostheses can be established within clinically relevant times.

This important process, however, is known as poorly understood in the area in polymer science. One of the reasons is that the conventional method of examining the swelling process is often inconsistent. Since it has many important properties including non-invasiveness, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Micro-imaging has become a significant method of analyzing biomaterials as well as biological specimens [1,2]. In the present study, a time-dependent swelling process was observed non-invasively to investigate the polymeric swelling effect using NMR micro-imaging. The present study provides a noble and non-invasive method of measuring the degree of swelling as well as volumetric changes occurring in polymers immersed in liquid. The information obtained relates to both a water ingress process and volumetric changes of polymer specimens. This proposed method also will provide more reliable techniques to ascertain the time-dependent swelling process than the other conventional methods. One of the important aspects of the present study is that the proposed method is a non-invasive technique and is also capable of ascertaining the time-dependent process of the swelling. This may be a new method of measuring the degree of swelling as well as the time-dependent water ingress process in a polymer.","PAI CHAI UNIV,DEPT PHYS,SU KU,TAEJON,SOUTH KOREA; KAIST,DEPT INFORMAT & COMMUN ENGN,SEOUL,SOUTH KOREA; KRICT,BIOMAT LAB,TAEJON,SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,3,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The following dairy biomaterials were chosen for investigations: three kefir bacterial cultures and one bacterial concentrate of a dairy vaccine. Experiments were performed both at one-region conductive or radiative heating and at combined two-region conductive-radiative heating. Emphasis was put on quality interactions between physical and biological properties of the material to be dried and freeze drying process parameters. Qualitative estimations of the following properties of biomaterials: a) colour, b) suppleness to caking and c) suppleness to scraping from the hot surface in dependence with the process parameters were performed using four-step subjective scales. On the basis of this estimations a synthetic quality criterion SQC was defined whose numerical value reflects general product quality. The results of mathematical modelling, numerical solution of the model and comparison with experimental data indicated that the process was heat transfer controlled and that the main factors resulting in good product quality and high SQC are low temperature of the conductive heated surface and vacuum chamber pressure affecting sublimation temperature. The influence of the sample freezing parameters on the elimination of the foaming or puffing and on the product quality was observed and examined.

As a consequence, dried biomaterials demand will rise and equipments will have to be built or redesigned to accommodate changes. The design and innovations on industrial dryers require fundamental knowledge conceived in laboratory units. The new heat pump dryer operates at a wide relative humidity and the air temperature is adjustable from -20 to 100 degrees C. Above and below freezing point drying modes are done in the same plant which allows the control of biomaterial properties. The technique consists of two stages, unbound weakly held water removal by freeze drying, and tightly bound moisture desorption by medium temperature drying. The fluidized and shelf heat pump dryers have the required features to dry heat sensitive biomaterials. The dryers were built and extensive research on biomaterials has been conducted at The Norwegian Institute of Technology. Many experiments were done on effect of heat pump drying conditions on enzyme and biological active bacteria solutions, fruits, cod fish, fish feed and shrimps. At optimum heat drying conditions, the bacteria Rhodococcus reached 100% viability and dried biomolecules attained full biological activity. The heat pump dryer allowed adjustment of the biomaterial properties and quality according to its phase, shape and size. Dried samples showed improvements on survival rate, rehydration, colour, hardness and mono-multimolecular sorption isotherms over poorly dried products. Beneficial results were achieved for nearly all tests.

Microbial spore sterilization by adiabatic expansion of water pressurized to over 600 MPa has been demonstrated. The sterilization of Bacillus stearothermophilus spores has been achieved by six consecutive adiabatic expansion cycles at temperatures below 70 degrees C. Twin-screw extrusion has been successfully applied to destroy allergens in proteinaceous food and feed materials such as soy flour, but could not be demonstrated with soybean. hulls of high carbohydrate content. It has been shown that allergens of buckwheat and soy pours can be partially destroyed by high shear using twin-screw extrusion cooking. Microparticulation technology using a jet mill has been employed to increase the surface hydrophobicity of proteinaceous particles milled to less than 3 mu m in diameter in order to prepare fat replacers Biodegradable loose fill packing, material has been prepared from corn starch by extrusion cooking.

This review discusses several critical controversies in this field and lay special emphasis on the cellular and biochemical reactions related to the formation mechanisms of lipofuscin, ceroid, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and age pigment-like fluorophores (APFs). Various amino compounds and their reaction with secondary aldehydic products of oxygen free radical-induced oxidation, particularly lipid peroxidation, are important sources of the fluorophores of ceroid/lipofuscin, which progressively accumulate as a result of phagocytosis and autophagocytosis of modified biomaterials within secondary lysosomes of postmitotic and other cells. Lipofuscin is the classical age pigment of postmitotic cells, while ceroid accumulates due to pathologic and experimental processes. There are good reasons to consider both ceroid and lipofuscin as materials of the same principal origin. The age-related intracellular fluorophores of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seems to represent a special class of lipofuscin, which partly contains derivatives of retinoids and carotenoids. Saccharide-originated fluorophores, principally AGEs formed during glycation/Maillard reactions, may be mainly responsible for the extracellular fluorescence of long-lived proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and lens crystalline. Although lipofuscin, ceroid, AGEs, and APFs can be produced from different types of biological materials due to different side reactions of essential biology, the crosslinking of carbonyl-amino compounds is recognized as a common process during their formation.",,"Yin, DZ (reprint author), LINKOPING UNIV, DEPT PATHOL, S-58185 LINKOPING, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,187,284,314,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0891-5849,1873-4596,,FREE RADICAL BIO MED,Free Radic.

These compliant layered cups must also exhibit considerable rigidity to resist the pinching action of the acetabulum during normal gait, especially in cases where the subchondral bone is removed during insertion. Hence, a stiff cup backing is required to compensate for the rigidity lost when using the soft layer. During normal loading conditions two areas of mechanical failure exist within the cup. Firstly, delamination due to varied material stiffness and secondly, loosening due to excess stresses at the cement or cup/bone interface. Also, adverse conditions may arise following periods of prolonged static loading, where the fluid film may break down allowing the articulating surfaces to come into direct asperity contact, resulting in higher frictional coefficients. In this study the stress analysis was performed using the finite element method. A 2D FE model of a pelvic slice was used to evaluate stress distributions in the cement layer and immediate surrounding bone for various cup stiffnesses. While, a 3D finite element model was used to analyse the effects of both friction and aspect ratio upon the stress distribution within the elastomeric layer Results obtained correlated well with established mathematical and/or FEA predictions The validity of both mathematical and FEA predicted results for the compliant layer stress analysis was assessed using experimentally obtained reaction forces and displacements. Although further work is currently being carried out to achieve the optimum cup design, a cup configuration to reduce both the cup and pelvic stresses was established and analysed using material properties typical of available biomaterials.",,"Bryan, KJ (reprint author), UNIV LIMERICK,DEPT MAT SCI & TECHNOL,LIMERICK,IRELAND.",,"Irish Centre for Composites, Research (ICOMP)/D-4887-2011",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS,CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE,"EINERSBERGER BLICK 28, PO BOX 266, W-3392 CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE, GERMANY",1013-9826,,0-87849-723-4,KEY ENG MAT,,,1996.0,118-,,,,,,347,354,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.118-119.347,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Materials Science,BF75N,WOS:A1996BF75N00040,,,,,2019-02-25

In particular, it demonstrates that macroscopic images ('stains'), that assess the spatial distribution of albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, and HMK (high molecular weight kininogen), can be obtained over areas of at least 12 cm(2) using immunospecific adhesion of dyed polystyrene beads. Stain intensities, measured with a scanner and an image analysis system, were found to quantify the amount of specific protein in the solution used to coat the surfaces. Results obtained with the proposed method produced single protein isotherms for albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fibrinogen that followed Langmuir-like adsorption behavior and were similar to previously published isotherms. The HMK isotherm also exhibited Langmuir-like adsorption behavior. The proposed method also detected the presence of an expected maximum in the adsorption of fibrinogen onto glass as a function of plasma dilution. Adsorption of fibrinogen out of 6.4% plasma onto glass from a separated flow produced results indicating the quantity as well as the location of fibrinogen at the boundary of the separated region. This result confirmed the utility of the proposed method for detecting spatial distributions of specific proteins adsorbed from plasma in practical devices.","COLUMBIA UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN MAT SCI & MIN ENGN,ARTIFICIAL ORGANS RES LAB,NEW YORK,NY 10027",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-44535],,,38,5,5,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The amount of proteins adsorbed on the PC-polymer from human plasma was smaller than that on not only the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) but also the OH-polymer and MeO-polymer. The PC group could weaken the interaction between plasma proteins and polymer surfaces. The amount of adsorbed proteins on the PC-polymer decreased with an increase in the mole fraction of the PC units in the polymers. We could observe an effect of the oxyethylene chain length (n is the number of repeating units of oxyethylene) on protein adsorption between n=2 and n=3. The platelet adhesion on these polymer surfaces was evaluated using rabbit platelet-rich plasma. On the polymers without the PC group, that is, poly(BMA), OH-polymer, and MeO-polymer, many platelets adhered and a considerable shape change in the adherent platelets occurred. On the other hand, the PC-polymers could effectively suppress platelet adhesion. The platelet adhesion behavior on the polymers was strongly dependent on the adsorbed proteins. Platelet adhesion was completely inhibited on all of the PC-polymers studied having a 0.3 PC unit mole fraction. However, it was observed that the oxyethylene chains on the PC-polymers with a 0.1 PC unit mole fraction affected platelet adhesion.","NIHON UNIV,COLL SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT IND CHEM,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN","Iwasaki, Y (reprint author), TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,CHIYODA KU,2-3-10 KANDA SURUGADAI,TOKYO 101,JAPAN.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,44,30,31,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The total amount of proteins adsorbed on the polymer surface from human plasma was determined, and the distribution of adsorbed proteins on the plasma-contacting surface was analyzed. The amount of proteins adsorbed on every poly(MAPC-co-BMA) was small compared with that observed on polymers without the phospholipid polar group. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of adsorbed proteins on the poly(MAPC-co-BMA) even when the methylene chain length between the phospholipid polar group and the backbone in the MAPC moiety was altered. Platelet adhesion on the polymer surface from a platelet suspension in a buffered solution was evaluated with and without plasma treatment on the surface. When a rabbit platelet suspension was brought into contact with the poly(BMA) surface after treatment with plasma, many platelets adhered and aggregated. However, a reduced amount of platelet adhered on the poly(BMA) was found in the case of direct contact with the platelet suspension. On the other hand, the poly(MAPC-co-BMA)s could inhibit platelet adhesion under both conditions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the proteins adsorbed on the surface play an important role in determining the platelet adhesion and suppression of the protein adsorption on the surface, which is one of the most significant ways of inhibiting platelet adhesion.","TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN; NIHON UNIV,COLL SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT IND CHEM,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN",,,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,40,48,50,0,9,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Other changes in adsorbed fibrinogen such as decreases in polyclonal antibody binding and SDS elutability supported the conclusion that fibrinogen undergoes postadsorptive conformational changes. Subsequently we measured the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the three putative platelet binding sites on fibrinogen, using a single mid-range concentration of antibody. We found that binding of a monoclonal antibody to the platelet binding site at the C-terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen changed little with residence time, while binding of monoclonal antibodies to the other two putative binding sites on fibrinogen either increased with residence time (RGDF at A alpha 95-98), or first increased and then decreased with residence time (RGDS at A alpha 572-575). In the current study, we measured antibody binding affinity, K-a, by measuring antibody binding at a series of antibody concentrations. This is a more sensitive method for detecting changes in adsorbed fibrinogen than measuring antibody binding from a single antibody concentration. The K-a was determined for two antibodies, M1 (4A5), which binds to a platelet binding domain of fibrinogen (gamma 402-411) and R1 (155 B1616), which binds to residues 87-100 of the A alpha chain (containing an RGDF site). A summary of the results for the M1 antibody are as follows. The K-a was higher for M1 binding to fibrinogen adsorbed to Immulon I(R) than to Biomer(R), Biospan(R) or poly(ethylene terephthalate), suggesting that fibrinogen adsorbed to Immulon I(R) is more platelet adhesive than fibrinogen adsorbed to the other polymers. On Biospan(R), the K-a decreased from 2.8 x 10(9) to 1.0 x 10(9) M(-1) after a 24 h 37 degrees C residence time, which correlated with the decrease in platelet adhesiveness of adsorbed fibrinogen observed previously under these conditions. The change in K-a was greater when adsorbed fibrinogen was kept under denaturing conditions. For example, the K-a decreased from 2.8 x 10(9) to 0.8 x 10(9) M(-1) after a 1 h 70 degrees C residence time whereas it remained approximately the same, 2.9 x 10(9) M(-1), after a 24 h 0 degrees C residence time.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT CHEM ENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; CHENGDU UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT POLYMER SCI,CHENGDU 610065,SICHUAN,PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL19419],,,37,26,26,0,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The immobilization of PEO was carried out with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in aqueous media. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain a maximal coupling of PEG. The degree of coupling was determined by the surface concentration of amino groups. The maximal surface concentrations of amino groups were close to what is expected for a complete coverage of the surface with PEG. Adsorption of albumin from a buffer solution onto PEG-containing surfaces was about 85% less than the albumin uptake by unmodified polystyrene latices. Protein adsorption from plasma dilutions was lower on surfaces containing PEO molecules with a higher molecular weight. The reduction of the protein uptake from plasma by surfaces containing PEO-3400 molecules was only 40% compared to the adsorption to unmodified surfaces. These results indicate that plasma proteins have a low affinity for surfaces modified with PEO.

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis results showed a characteristic sulfur (S) and sodium (Na) peaks after modification with dextran sulfate. The sulfur/carbon (S/C) atomic composition ratio increased from 0.03 to 0.08 when the bulk dextran sulfate concentration used for modification was increased from 2.5 to 10 mg ml(-1). The permeability of urea and creatinine did not change significantly upon modification with heparin or dextran sulfate. Surface modification, however, did decrease the permeability coefficients of glucose, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-12. Unlike Cuprophan, chitosan and surface-modified chitosan membranes did not significantly activate the complement system as measured by the serum iC3b concentration. Compared to forty and sixty fully-activated platelets present on control surfaces, surface modification with heparin and dextran sulfate significantly reduced the number of adherent platelets per 25000 mu m(2) area and the extent of platelet activation. Surface modification with anionic polysaccharides, however, did significantly shorten the plasma recalcification time leading to fibrin clot formation.

In previous investigations we have demonstrated that hydrophilic materials bind preadsorbed fibronectin that can easily be reorganized by fibroblasts in a specific matrix-like structure, while on less wettable materials (possessing water contact angles above 60 deg) the cells were unable to do this. As the cells continuously produce their fibronectin matrix, we tried in this study to answer the question of how the surface wettability of biomaterials influences the endogenous fibronectin matrix formation and its subsequent organization on the substrate. We cultured fibroblasts for 72 h on five different wettable surfaces: glass, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, pellethane, polyvinylchloride, and silicone, with water-contact angles gradually ranging from 25 to 105 deg. We demonstrated that the decreasing wettability of the materials significantly reduced endogenous fibronectin deposition on the substratum. Moreover, fibrillar organization of fibronectin appeared only on relatively hydrophilic glass and APS substrate, while on more hydrophobic materials like PVC and SI, cells secreted some fibronectin but were not able to organize it into a fibronectin matrix. These results were correlated with an altered cell morphology and spreading on these materials. In addition, an ELISA method has been implemented to quantify fibronectin matrix formation as a possible measure of the biocompatibility of materials, where a clear relation has been found between fibroblast growth and fibronectin matrix formation.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,INST CHEM,DEPT MEMBRANE RES,D-14513 TELTOW,GERMANY","Altankov, G (reprint author), BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOPHYS,STR ACAD G BONCHEV,BL 21,SOFIA 1113,BULGARIA.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,34,39,44,1,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

However, its importance and relevance justify all the efforts made. An interdisciplinary approach is required. We report on our study of a product for bone substitution. Coral is a natural product, the interest of which we have already demonstrated in our previous work. Following sterilization, natural coral was implanted in sheep femurs. We regularly extracted the implants from the femurs to study the kinetics of elemental mineral transformation of the bone substitutes. For the first time ever, and thanks to the PIXE method (particles induced X-ray emission), we were able to measure the concentration of mineral elements at different time intervals after implantation over a whole cross-section. We found a discontinuity of the mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Fe) at the interface between the implant and the receiver. This shows that the osseous attack is not global but, on the contrary, centripetal. Moreover, the fit of the concentration time course indicates that the kinetics of ossification are different for each atomic element and characterize a distinct biological phenomenon. Our analyses confirm the biocompatibility and the ossification of the implanted coral.","UNIV CLERMONT FERRAND,F-63177 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE; IPNE,B-4000 LIEGE,BELGIUM; ATOM ENERGY ORG IRAN,TEHRAN,IRAN; HOP HOTEL DIEU,SERV CHIRURG INFANTILE,F-63000 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE","Irigaray, JL (reprint author), CNRS,IN2P3,LAB PHYS CORPUSULAIRE CLERMONT FERRAND,F-63177 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE.",,,,,,,9,8,8,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The results showed that the hydrophilic plasma polymerized PEO and PNVP films on DDS-glass did not prevent platelet adhesion and activation. The film thickness had only marginal influence on the prevention of platelet activation. In contrast, platelet adhesion was prevented on DDS-glass adsorbed with a PEO-containing block copolymer (Pluronic(R) F-108 surfactant) even at a calculated thickness of the PEO layer of less than 40 nm. This study shows that surface hydrophilization is not sufficient for prevention of platelet adhesion and activation. The contrasting results in platelet adhesion between cross-linked plasma polymers and linear PEO-containing block copolymers may be explained qualitatively by a steric repulsion mechanism that is achieved by the conformational freedom of the linear PEO chains interacting with water.","PURDUE UNIV,SCH PHARM,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,43,28,28,0,4,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To further explore the effects of this premature activation, we evaluated the supernatants of biomaterial associated neutrophils to determine whether soluble mediators were released, and the likely role of these mediators. We show that these supernatants contain a chemoattractant and thereby induce chemotaxis by fresh neutrophils. No evidence of enhanced oxidative free radical production by either unstimulated neutrophils or a primed response to other mediators occurs when neutrophils were incubated with these supernatants. We also examined the effect of adding fresh neutrophils to a biomaterial surface containing a previous inoculum of neutrophils, and observed that the fresh cells did not become stimulated to release reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and also exhibited impaired killing of staphylococci. These studies suggest that not only does the biomaterial surface activate the initial wave of neutrophils but that subsequent waves of neutrophils exhibit an impaired host-defense function. These results are consistent with the known impairment of host defense in the presence of biomaterials, and provide evidence for a long-term down-regulation of neutrophil function at biomaterial surfaces.

A foreign-body reaction was the characteristic host tissue response against the implants. The resorption of the implanted materials was analyzed by measuring both the weight and the collagen persistences. This last was measured by using (C-14)acetylated collagen, which was revealed to be not modified upon radioactive labeling, in terms of its ability to form a complex with sepiolite. The persistence of the implants is controllable by treatment of the collagen component with glutaraldehyde. Thus, for 1% glutaraldehyde-treated collagen complexes, 100% of persistence was observed after several months of implantation, this value decreasing to a few days for nontreated collagen samples. The collagen-sepiolite complex showed a low immunological response, almost null for 1% glutaraldehyde-treated collagen complexes, which was analyzed by measuring anti-collagen antibodies levels. Based on the performed studies, sepiolite-collagen complexes can be considered a resorbable material.

The mechanisms whereby the implant surface may elicit and modulate leukocyte functions in vivo are not understood, partly due to the technical difficulties of examining the local inflammatory events in vicinity of the material-tissue interface with conventional biochemical and immunological techniques. In the present study a newly developed biplate implant was inserted subcutaneously in the mouse. Leukocytes from the local inflammatory exudate and leukocytes associated to the surface of the implants were retrieved after 1 and 6 days and separately assayed with respect to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production ex vivo. Implantation caused a local accumulation of predominantly mononuclear cells in the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. The H2O2 production was found to be low in both the subcutaneous exudate and the implant-associated leukocytes, irrespective of implant material and implantation times. However, ex vivo-stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused an enhanced H2O2, production. These observations show that biplate implants do not maximally activate the oxidative metabolism of the recruited leukocytes. The exudate leukocytes were more responsive to PMA stimulation in comparison with implant-associated leukocytes, indicating that properties of the implant surface and possibly surface-associated proteins could modify the responsiveness of the phagocytic cells at the implant site. Our results suggest that the present biplate model may be suitable for further studies on local production of oxygen metabolites and function of leukocytes at implanted biomaterials.

The large pores in the interior of these beads provide space for cell growth. However, it has been observed that the cell distribution in the interior of microcarriers is often uneven. In some cases, the pores appear to be unoccupied. Questions thus arise as to whether all pores are open to the bead surface, and whether the pores allow cell entry and proliferation. To examine the accessibility and geometrical features of the pores, laser scanning confocal microscope was used to optically section fluorescein isothiocyanate stained microcarriers. Three dimensional images were reconstructed by combining the sections for examination of the openness as well as the connectivity of the pores. By employing image processing software, the solid structure of the beads was removed from reconstructed three dimensional images to allow for direct visualization of the pores. A wide variety of geometries was observed; some pores were interconnected while others were segregated from each other. It was observed that while many pores were open to the surface through sufficiently large channels for cell entrance, a large number of pores was also either closed to the exterior or accessed the surface only through constricted channels which might impede cell entry. This confocal microscopic technique for direct evaluation of pore structure of macroporous beads is noninvasive and requires minimal sample preparation. It can easily be adapted for in situ observation of cell behavior as well as find application for structural assessment for various biomaterials.","UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT CHEM ENGN & MAT SCI,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455",,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,0,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

Beyond its immediate problems for the patients, the crisis has also discredited the use of silicone rubber as one of the most widely used biomaterials. Silicone elastomer or gel, the primary material in mammary prostheses, may be exposed to the body's tissues via envelope rupture, gel bleed, or elastomer fragmentation. Local responses to silicone include granulomatous inflammation, capsular contraction, and infection, all in varying degrees depending on ill-defined factors, which may include patient condition, peri- and postoperative complications, and hereditary predisposition, as well as material properties such as surface texture. The theory that silicone breast implants cause immunological disorders has not been proven. However, further study is necessary because some patients report autoimmune-like disorders (human adjuvant disease) following implant placement. Like autoimmune disease, human adjuvant disease is characterized by abnormalities of the immune response, autoantibody formation, and chronic inflammation. Silicone has been shown to play the role of an adjuvant, providing constant nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. Some researchers have hypothesized the role of silicone in specific immune reactions, including immunoglobulin formation and T-cell activation. This report examines the role of silicone as an agent of disease, focusing on material surface-tissue interactions.","CLEMSON UNIV, DEPT BIOENGN, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA; UNIV S CAROLINA, SCH MED, DEPT SURG, COLUMBIA, SC USA",,,,,,,,48,16,18,0,2,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Cement granulomas, micron-sized polyethylene particles-induced giant-celled granulomas, sheets of submicron-sized polyethylene particles-laden macrophages, and aggregated, metallic particles-laden macrophages were scattered in the fibrous tissue of all interfacial membranes. Quantitatively, characteristics of the interfacial membranes of the two groups differed from one another. The dominant species of prosthetic debris in the interfacial membranes of the short-term surviving joint replacements was derived from the polyethylene acetabular socket, and, correspondingly, giant-celled granulomas and macrophagic sheets predominated. Metallic particles and the macrophagic reaction thereto dominated in the interfacial membranes of the long-term surviving arthroplasties, and large cement and polyethylene chunks typically were incorporated in the fibrous tissue of the membranes without an accompanying macrophagic response. In long-term surviving hip arthroplasties, metallic particles may be at least as important as polymeric detritus in stimulating the formation of the bone-resorbing, granulomatous interfacial membrane, which is the hallmark of aseptically loosened arthroplasties. Differences in mechanical settings may account for unlike modes and rates of generation of prosthetic breakdown products, explaining the disparate survivorship of different patients' artificial joints.","BNAI ZION MED CTR, ASSOC PATIENTS IMPLANTED JOINTS, CTR IMPLANT SURG, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL","Boss, JH (reprint author), BNAI ZION MED CTR, ASSOC PATIENTS IMPLANTED JOINTS, DEPT PATHOL, POB 4940, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL.",,,,,,,78,10,10,0,3,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Thus, jaw bone cells grown on hydroxylapatite proliferated very little, while expressing discrete levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and of osteocalcin secretion into the growth medium. On the other hand, bone cells seeded onto titanium surfaces proliferated much more intensely than those on Thermanox(R), besides expressing alkaline phosphatase (very intensely after 5 days) and secreting osteocalcin. Thus, both kinds of titanium surfaces greatly enlarged the size of both populations of preosteoblastic precursors and of pre-osteoblasts in vitro, but plasma-sprayed titanium surfaces elicited, between day 2 and 5 in culture, greater increases in bone cell numbers markedly enhancing their proliferative and alkaline phosphatase activities, along with their osteocalcin secretion into the growth medium, and thus favouring the expression of the mature osteoblastic phenotype.

XPS spectra indicated that the MPC unit is located on the surface of PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III. The measurements of equilibrium water content and contact angle to water confirmed that the higher molecular weight of side chains results in higher hydrophilicity of PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III surface. The tensile modulus showed values of E=13.3 similar to 38.4 MPa for PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III films.

Two strategies are currently in use to achieve the goal of new blood compatible polymers: Firstly, existing cellulosic membranes are modified by introducing functional groups through ether and ester bonds and secondly, synthetic polymers are mixed with bull additives or copolymerized with other polymers. Biological responses as a consequence of blood/material interaction are common observations. However, blood compatibility in general cannot be improved by a single membrane surface feature. The assessment of a series of surface properties shows that physiological defense systems, like complement and cell activation, or coagulation are differently stimulated by means of the same surface structures of biomaterials. Thus, a compromise has to be found, already during membrane development. We synthetized a series of modifications of cellulosic membranes with the aim to investigate whether the type of substituent and its degree of substitution has an influence on the blood compatibility of these dialysis membranes. Data indicate that alterations in the lipophilic/hydrophilic balance (HLB) on the polymer surface may explain substituent-related changes in haemocompatibility. Optimal degrees of substitution are characteristic for a given type of substituent and enables the membrane manufacturer to tailor materials for improved blood compatibility.","AKZO NOBEL FASER AG,MEMBRANA,WUPPERTAL,GERMANY",,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,2,HUTHIG & WEPF VERLAG,BASEL,"AUF DEM WOLF 4 FX#001-41-61-317-94-11, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

To increase this knowledge the modification of polymer surfaces, their characterization, and the investigation of the response of the biosystem is considered to be a suitable approach. Surface modification may be performed in the wet-chemical way (heterogeneous reaction) or by means of treatment with a suitable plasma (glow discharge). Surface sensitive methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflexion mode as well as surface energy measurements are useful for surface characterization. To determine the bioresponse to the polymer surface, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, cell growth and full blood tests may be used. In the present paper several systems are described with respect to their surface modification, characterization, and bioresponse. It is shown that the protein adsorption is triggered by the surface, that SO2 plasma treatment enhances cell growth and that there seems to be a biocompatibility window for a surface characterized by a zeta-potential between -4 and -8 mV and a ratio of dispersive to polar contributions of surface energy around 12. It is stressed, however, that the final solution for a biomaterial is a material which, in the course of degradation, constantly presents a new biocompatible surface.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,DEUTSCH WOLLFORSCHUNGSINST,D-52062 AACHEN,GERMANY","Hocker, H (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,LEHRSTUHL TEXT CHEM & MAKROMOLEK CHEM,VELTMANPL 8,D-52062 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,8,5,5,0,3,HUTHIG & WEPF VERLAG,BASEL,"AUF DEM WOLF 4 FX#001-41-61-317-94-11, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

The results showed that as the nitrogen content increased, the tensile and fatigue strengths increased, the hardness increased slightly and the ductility decreased. The metallographic analysis showed that the nitrogen content had little effect on the grain size. When the nitrogen content in the alloy was increased, the formation of finer carbides of the M(6)C type was promoted ahead of the M(23)C(6) type.

Most interestingly, the number of staphylococci present in the biofilms covering rGM-CSF-coated implants were significantly lower than the number of bacteria detected on the surface of H-PE not coated with rGM-CSF. In vitro, rGM-CSF restored the anti-bacterial potency of the phagocytes, which had been reduced by surface contact with H-PE, The results suggest that modification of biomaterials with rGM-CSF could be one way of preventing staphylococcal infections; especially in neutropenic disorders, which constitute the highest risk factor for foreign body-associated infections.","UNIV LODZ,INST MICROBIOL & IMMUNOL,DEPT INFECT BIOL,PL-90237 LODZ,POLAND; LUND UNIV,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,2,CENTER ACADEMIC PUBL JAPAN,TOKYO,"4-16 YAYOI 2-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN",0385-5600,,,MICROBIOL IMMUNOL,Microbiol.

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, AN69(R)) dialysis membranes have been shown to improve the outcome of critically ill patients. Factor D is an essential enzyme of the alternative pathway of complement and is increased during renal failure. On the other hand the contact of blood with biomaterials activates the complement cascade through the alternative pathway. PAN filters adsorb factor D which looses its enzymatic activity whilst bound to the membrane [1]; the complement alternative pathway function of serum exposed to PAN filters is greatly diminished and restored after addition of purified factor D [1]. The aim of our study was to measure the time course of factor D adsorption and its blood concentration during CVVH in critically ill patients with acute renal failure. Methods. We studied seven critically ill patients with ARF before, during and after continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) with AN69. Results. There was a rapid decrease of factor D levels to 62(+/-6%) of the pre-CVVH value during the first 2 h, which continued to 51(+/-7.3%) after 12 h; at 24 h there was a slight rise to 62+/-12%. Sequential use of Polyacrylonitrile (AN69(R)) filters lowered factor D levels below the normal plasma concentration in three patients, thus producing a state of factor D depletion. Conclusion. The significant reduction of factor D levels during CVVH with PAN filters suggests that frequent changes of PAN filters may reduce alternative pathway function by lowering factor D levels. CVVH (as opposed to intermittent dialysis) with PAN membranes may further improve the outcome of critically ill patients.","UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT ANAESTHESIOL,DIV SURG INTENS CARE,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND; UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT MED,DIV NEPHROL,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND; UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT MED,DIV MED INTENS CARE,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,10,48,50,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0931-0509,,,NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL,Nephrol.

Recently we have studied the interaction of picosecond and femtosecond laser radiation in the visible region of the spectrum with synthetic polymer films and we have compared these studies with our similar studies nab nanosecond duration laser radiation. Biocompatible polymers have been extensively used for sutures, vascular grafts or bone and other hard tissue replacements. The use of surgical lasers for intervention on biocompatible material - tissue interfaces has attracted a great deal of interest, as both the high intensity, short pulse duration lasers and the prosthetic biomaterials are in increasing use. Our recent ablation studies, using ultrashort laser pulses, of biocompatible materials, are described in this article. Lasers were introduced in medical research in the early sixties but the laser beam ability to remove efficiently and safely soft or hard tissue, the lateral thermal damage and the final surface characteristics are still under investigation In the past few years, pulse mid-infrared lasers have attracted much attention because they operate at wavelengths where soft or hard tissue, try virtue of their water or water and hydroxyapatite content respectively, exhibit strong absorption restricting residual thermal damage to a relatively small zone. Recently we have investigated the interaction of short pulse laser radiation of picosecond and femtosecond duration with soft and hard tissue, as this unexplored field is expected to be a potential alternative in powerful laser processing of biomedical structures.

The material could be used, much as a bone graft, as material itself resorbs or dissolves as bone growth occurs, and end result is new remolded bone. Ca2P2O7 is one of intermediate product of bone mineralized crystal from amorphous calcium phosphates. The Ca2P2O7 doped with certain amount of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was prepared as the developed material. In this study, the Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was used for liquid phase sintering additive which was expected to improve sintering process and promote physiological bioresorbability. Compressive strength and 4-point bending strength were measured by Bionix test system 858. At the beginning, the mechanical strength was proportionally increasing with the addition of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O up to 5 wt%, but thereafter decreased The microstructure and crystalline identification was analyzed by the techniques of SEM, EPMA, TEM and XRD. The relationship between mechanical strength of the sintered bioceramics and Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O dopant was in terms of the presence of NaCa(PO3)(3), grain growth and abnormal grain coalescence while dopant increased. Preliminary in-vivo evaluation was studied by rabbit femur condyle implantation model. There was no inflammation or any toxic sign during the experimental period. The histological section of intraosseous implantation revealed that the new bone directly deposited on the surface of the material at the 4th week after operation. The materials were gradually decreasing in volume and being replaced by the surrounding regenerated bone in the rabbit condyle in-vivo environment. The results was encouraged us to conclude that the developed material did have a great potential as an ideal biodegradable bone substitute.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAIPEI,TAIWAN","Lin, FH (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,CTR BIOMED ENGN,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.",,"Lin, Feng-Huei/E-3970-2010",,,,,25,0,1,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS,CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE,"EINERSBERGER BLICK 28, PO BOX 266, W-3392 CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE, GERMANY",1013-9826,,,KEY ENG MAT,,,1996.0,115,,,,,,191,208,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.115.191,,,,18,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science,BE83H,WOS:A1996BE83H00013,,,,,2019-02-25

However, in the as-cast condition these alloys are relatively brittle due to the precipitation of interdendritic carbide phases, a-phase, and gas porosity. Furthermore, the carbon content has to be kept to a minimum for optimum alloy performance under wear conditions (such as in applications for prosthetic devices). Hence, in this work the effect of carbon content and heat treating on the exhibited mechanical properties was investigated. For this purpose three alloys (0.05, 0.16, and 0.31% C) were fabricated by remelting a commercial ASTM-F75 alloy under an inert environment followed by casting cylindrical bars of 13.5 mm diameter by 250 mm in length. The heat treatments consisted of annealing at 1250 degrees C for four hours followed by furnace cooling and/or water quenching. It was found that the alloy strength is not severely affected by the carbon content. In particular, the 0.05% C alloy exhibits a strain hardening behaviour which suggests an FCC to HCP strain induced martensitic transformation. At higher carbon contents the extent of the transformation is drastically reduced, probably due to the presence of significant second phase precipitates. In addition, relatively slow cooling rates seem to hinder the extent of the strain induced transformation.","CONVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estud Avanzados, Unidad Saltillo, Saltillo 25900, Coahuila, Mexico","Salinas-Rodriguez, A (reprint author), CONVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estud Avanzados, Unidad Saltillo, Km 13 Carr, Saltillo 25900, Coahuila, Mexico.",,,,,,,14,3,3,0,0,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-349-X,,,,1996.0,,,,,,,69,79,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM42Z,WOS:000078691600005,,,,,2019-02-25

Metal replicas make near ideal samples for STM in comparison to the original biological materials. Modifications include a 0.1 mu m backing layer of silver and mounting the replicas on a fine-mesh silver filters to enhance the rigidity of the metal replica. This is required unless STM imaging is carried out in vacuum; otherwise, a liquid film of contamination physically connects the STM tip with the sample. This mechanical coupling leads to exaggerated height measurements; the enhanced rigidity of the thicker replica eliminates much of the height amplification. Further improvement was obtained by imaging in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Calibration and reproducibility were tested with replicas of well characterized bilayers of cadmium arachidate on mica that provide regular 5.5 nm steps. We have used the STM/replica technique to examine the ripple shape and amplitude in the P-beta. phase of dimyristoylphosphatidyl-choline (DMPC) in water. STM images were analyzed using a cross-correlation averaging program to eliminate the effects of noise and the finite size and shapes of the metal grains that make up the replica. The correlation averaging allowed us to develop a composite ripple profile averaged over hundreds of individual ripples and different samples. The STM/replica technique is sufficiently general that it can be used to examine a variety of hydrated lipid and protein samples at a lateral resolution of about 1 nm and a vertical resolution of about 0.3 mn.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Zasadzinski, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gorilla@squid.ucsb.edu,,,,,,128,0,0,0,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INTERNATIONAL,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",,,0-931288-49-5,,,,1996.0,,,,,,,123,148,,,,,,26,Biochemical Research Methods; Microscopy,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Microscopy,BM31Y,WOS:000078376200011,9601535.0,,,,2019-02-25

In general, special surface properties with regard to chemical composition, hydrophilicity, roughness, crystallinity, conductivity, lubricity, and cross-linking density are required for the success of these applications. Polymers very often do not possess the surface properties needed for these applications. However, they have excellent bulk physical and chemical properties, are inexpensive, and are easy to process. For these reasons, surface modification techniques which can transform these inexpensive materials into highly valuable finished products have become an important part of the plastics and many other industries. In recent years, many advances have been made in developing surface treatments to alter the chemical and physical properties of polymer surfaces without affecting bulk properties. Common surface modification techniques include treatments by flame, corona, plasmas, photons, electron beams, ion beams, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Plasma treatment is probably the most versatile surface treatment technique. Different types of gases such as argon, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, carbon dioxide, and water can produce the unique surface properties required by various applications. For example, oxygen-plasma treatment can increase the surface energy of polymers, whereas fluorine-plasma treatment can decrease the surface energy and improve the chemical inertness. Cross-linking at a polymer surface can be introduced by an inert-gas plasma. Modification by plasma treatment is usually confined to the top several hundred angstroms and does not affect the bulk properties. The main disadvantage of this technique is that it requires a vacuum system, which increases the cost of operation. Thin polymer films with unique chemical and physical properties are produced by plasma polymerization. This technology is still in its infancy, and the plasma chemical process is not fully understood. The films are prepared by vapor phase deposition and can be formed on practically any substrate with good adhesion between the film and the substrate. These films, which are usually highly cross-linked and pinhole-free, have very good barrier properties. Such films find great potential in biomaterial applications and in the microelectronics industry. Very high-power microwave-driven mercury lamps are available, and they are used in UV-hardening of photoresist patterns for image stabilization at high temperatures. Other applications of UV irradiation include surface photo-oxidation, increase of hydrophilicity, and photocuring of paintings. Pulsed UV-lasers are used in surface modification in many areas. Pulsed UV-laser irradiation can produce submicron periodic linear and dot patterns on polymer surfaces without photomask. These interference patterns can be used to increase surface roughness of inert polymers for improved adhesion. These images can also be transferred to silicon surfaces by reactive ion etching. Pulsed laser beams can be applied to inert polymer surfaces for increased hydrophilicity and wettability. Polymer surfaces treated by pulsed UV-laser irradiation can be positively or negatively charged to enhance chemical reactivity and processability. Pulsed UV-laser exposures with high fluence give rise to photoablation with a clean wall profile. There are many other practical applications of laser photoablation, including via-hole fabrication, and diamond-film deposition. The present review discusses all these current applications, especially in the biomedical and microelectronics areas.","HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM, KOWLOON, HONG KONG","Chan, CM (reprint author), HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM ENGN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG.",,,,,,,196,335,335,8,204,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-5729,,,SURF SCI REP,Surf.

Quantitative or qualitative cell adhesion measurements would be useful for screening new implant materials. Microjet impingement has been evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, to determine to what extent it measures cell adhesion. The shear forces of the impingement, on the materials tested here, are seen to be greater than the cohesive strength of the cells in the impinged area, causing their rupture. The cell bodies are removed during impingement, leaving the sites of adhesion and other cellular material behind. Thus the method is shown not to provide quantification of cell adhesion forces for the metals and culture plastic tested. It is suggested that with highly adherent biomaterials, the distribution and patterns of these adhesion sites could be used for qualitative comparisons for screening of implant surfaces.","UNIV WALES,INST BIOL SCI,ABERYSTWYTH SY23 3DA,DYFED,WALES; TULANE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,NEW ORLEANS,LA 70118","Richards, RG (reprint author), AO ASIF RES INST,CLAVADELERSTR,CH-7270 DAVOS,SWITZERLAND.",,"Richards, Robert/I-8235-2015","Richards, Robert/0000-0002-7778-2480",,,,28,20,20,1,4,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 7DX",1065-6995,,,CELL BIOL INT,Cell Biol.

Numerous attempts have been made to create a novel surface that reduces the adverse effects of blood interaction with the material. The purpose of this study was to create reactive groups on Dacron without significantly altering the chemical and physical properties of the biomaterial. These groups would then serve as ''anchor sites'' for covalent attachment of the blood protein albumin to the surface, thus creating a more biocompatible surface. Denier reduction, an established textile chemistry procedure that creates carboxyl groups on the fiber surface via hydrolysis of the material, was performed at 100 degrees C using sodium hydroxide concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% (treated materials referred to as 0.5% hydrolyzed etc.). Tensile strength determination of hydrolyzed materials revealed no statistically significant difference in material strength between control, 0.5, and 1.0% hydrolyzed materials; the 2.5 and 5.0% hydrolyzed materials had significant strength loss as compared to the controls. Significant fiber weight loss occurred in the 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% hydrolyzed Dacron segments. The 0.5% hydrolyzed material did not have any significant weight loss. Covalent linkage of I-125-albumin to these modified materials using the crosslinker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) resulted in the 0.5% hydrolyzed material having the greatest protein binding (330 ng/mg Dacron, 2.4-fold greater than control). Incubation of the 0.5% hydrolyzed material with EDC and various concentrations of I-125-albumin resulted in the 14.80 mu M solution permitting the greatest binding per milligram Dacron (330 ng/mg Dacron). Scanning electron microscopy, performed blindly, revealed no change in the 0.5% hydrolyzed Dacron as compared to untreated Dacron. The 5.0% hydrolyzed Dacron, however, had noticeable structural damage on the outer periphery of the fiber surface. Observation of the untreated Dacron with nonspecifically bound albumin showed scattered areas of albumin adherent to the fiber surface whereas covalent linkage of albumin to the 0.5% hydrolyzed Dacron via EDC crosslinking showed numerous albumin moieties on each fiber. This study demonstrates that a clinically accepted biomaterial (Dacron) can be chemically modified, without significantly altering the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, in order to covalently bind albumin to the fiber surface. Thus, these results serve as foundation for creating potential novel biomaterials without significantly altering the properties of the original biomaterial.

Successful implementation of immunoisolation has been hampered by the foreign-body reaction to biomaterials. We screened a variety of commercially available membranes for foreign-body reactions following implantation under the skin of rats. Histologic analysis revealed that neovascularization at the membrane-tissue interface occurred in several membranes that had pore sizes large enough to allow complete penetration by host cells (0.8-8-mu m pore size). When the vascularization of the membrane-tissue interface of 5-mu m-pore-size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes was compared to 0.02-mu m-pore-size PTFE membranes, it was found that the larger pore membranes had 80-100-fold more vascular structures. The increased vascularization was observed even though the larger pore membrane was laminated to a smaller pore inner membrane to prevent cell entry into the prototype immunoisolation device.

Hemagglutination was abolished by periodate oxidation and digestion with glycosidases. It was markedly inhibited by beta-lactose and its monosaccharide constituents in a concentration-dependent fashion. Hemagglutinin expression depended on the presence of glucose.

Cytotoxicity and further related risks of amalgams are discussed in a controversial way in the literature without leading to a final conclusion. There is still a need for basic clinical and pre-clinical research, especially with respect to the wide distribution of dental amalgams. Standardized methods of cytotoxicity testing have been established by the ISO. It was the aim of the present study to detect and compare possible cytotoxic effects of dental amalgams and alternative non-amalgam alloys in vitro. According to the ISO standards, direct contact tests and extract dilution tests were performed using the cell lines HeLa and L-929 as well as primary isolated human fibroblasts, a relevant cell type of the human gingiva. For direct contact tests the samples were fixed on thermanox discs. Zn and Ni-chloride in defined molar concentrations were used as positive controls in the extract dilution tests, while copper was the positive control in the direct contact tests. The tested amalgam was a Non-Gamma-2 amalgam. For extract dilution tests sixteen extraction dilutions were performed. The different cell types were incubated with the extracts in 96-well microtitre plates. MTT-testing was performed to evaluate the effects on cellular metabolism. The BrdU labelling index was determined with the help of EIA methods to analyse the effects of the extracts on the cellular proliferation at DNA synthesis level. The morphological status of the cells seeded on the materials (direct contact test) were studied with the help of light microscopy. No cytotoxic effects of formerly extracted dental amalgam was found, although fresh amalgam elicited a significant cytotoxic effect, in general the non-amalgams have to be regarded as non cytotoxic. The negative control and the non-amalgams elicited no measurable cytotoxicity in the indirect contact assays, independent of the number of extraction dilutions. This applied to all cell types studied. The tested amalgam also gave a significant cytotoxic effect in the MTT-assays, while in addition a significant reduction of BrdU incorporation after incubation with the extracts of the first dilution series, compared to the silicone control was found. The effects were reduced after an incubation with the extracts of the higher dilution series. It is suggested by the presented results that amalgams might have cytotoxic effects, especially when being freshly applied. The cytotoxic effects were no longer detectable after extraction procedures. Nevertheless, a negative effect around such amalgams must be considered. The insights provided by the present studies might be helpful for a rational choice of dental materials.","QUALIDENT SA,CH-1217 MEYRIN 1,SWITZERLAND","Klein, CL (reprint author), UNIV MAINZ,INST PATHOL,LANGENBECKSTR 1,D-55101 MAINZ,GERMANY.",,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Smooth electrodes were compared with porous electrodes produced by sintering and with fractal electrodes resulting from physical vapour deposition of iridium or titanium nitride.

Analysis of electrochemical properties proved the advantages of fractal coating: the impedance spectra exhibited incomparable low impedances for frequencies down to 1 Hz and no afterpotentials could be detected.

A brief review of the basic mechanisms of cytotoxicity and the use of different in vitro methods for testing the cytotoxicity of biomaterials is presented.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,BIOMAT RES UNIT,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH MED CHARITE,DEPT ORTHODONT & DENTOFACIAL ORTHPED,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY","Groth, T (reprint author), GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,INST CHEM,DEPT MEMBRANE RES,KANTSTR 55,D-14513 TELTOW,GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,93,29,29,1,26,FRAME,NOTTINGHAM,"RUSSELL & BURCH HOUSE 96-98 NORTH SHERWOOD ST, NOTTINGHAM, NOTTS, ENGLAND NG1 4EE",0261-1929,,,ATLA-ALTERN LAB ANIM,ATLA-Altern.

We compared the effects of two physical crosslinking methods, ultraviolet irradiation (UV) (254 nm) and dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment, on the mechanical properties and molecular integrity of collagen fibers extruded from an acidic dispersion of type I bovine dermal collagen. Collagen fibers exposed to UV irradiation for 15 min had ultimate tensile strength (54 MPa) and modulus (184 MPa) values greater than or equivalent to values for fibers crosslinked with DHT treatment for 3 or 5 days. UV irradiation is a rapid and easily controlled means of increasing the mechanical strength of collagen fibers. Characterization of collagen extracted from the crosslinked samples by dilute acetic acid and limited pepsin digestion indicate that both UV and DHT treatments cause fragmentation of at least a portion of the collagen molecules. Partial loss of the native collagen structure may influence attachment, migration, and proliferation of cells on collagen fiber-based ligament analogs. These issues are currently being addressed in our laboratory.

It is particularly useful for measuring strains in materials where the use of conventional extensometers or strain gauges is impracticable, such as in reinforcement fibers and orthodontic wires and in hostile environments. The technique is based on the well known technique of observing translating laser speckle with a linear-array charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. However, it employs a relatively new data processing algorithm involving a two-dimensional frequency transform of the data. Advantages of the technique include: insensitivity to slow surface microstructure changes, insensitivity to zero-mean noise processes, compact design, modest resolution requirements, and the fact that it is truly noncontact. Strain rate measurements were made on an 0.028-gauge round stainless steel orthodontic wire as an example of this technique. The Young's modulus of the wire based on the speckle technique was 2.04 x 10(11) Nm(-2), which is very close to the textbook value.

Five weeks after the injection, we found clearly demarcated granulomas. Histological and immunohistochemical studies showed that these granulomas were similar among all strains, with either paucity or absence of lymphoid cells, In situ hybridization with use of complementary RNA probes indicated that macrophages were synthesizing interleukin-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA), a marker of macrophage activation, and a cytokine implicated in pathological bone resorption. We concluded that, in mice, there is a lymphocyte-independent pathway of macrophage activation in response to particulate polymethylmethacrylate, This suggests that the foreign-body response to particulate orthopaedic biomaterials is macrophage-initiated and maintained and that lymphocytes are not essential to this response, although they may modulate it. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The mammalian response to particulate biomaterials does not appear to fit a specific immune hypersensitivity response; rather, it seems to follow a non-specific pattern of macrophage phagocytosis, activation, and cellular response to monokine release, Differences in the response to debris among patients, manifested by differences in the rapidity and extent of osteolysis around joint prostheses, are more probably related to factors other than the hypersensitivity response, such as the amount of particles released, individual differences in macrophage activation, or intracellular damage created by the particles after phagocytosis.","TUFTS UNIV NEW ENGLAND MED CTR,BOSTON,MA 02111; MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP,BOSTON,MA 02114",,,,,,,,34,38,38,0,0,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

The interdisciplinary field combines, biomaterials cell biology, and cell culture bio-engineering technology. The main focus of tissue engineering is the synthesis of artificial constructs or tissues based on vital cells or cell matrix. Biomaterials provide a three-dimensional structure to shape or guide tissue development. Isolated cartilage cells from a patient can form new tissues when suspended in non-woven resorbable polymers for reconstructive surgery. To achieve sufficient amounts of autologous cells for transplant formation, cells from biopsies have to be multiplied in monolayer culture. Dedifferentiated and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells may be used for bone and cartilage engineering. High cell densities in three-dimensional cultures require perfusion techniques to stabilize culture conditions. Morphogenetic factors such as BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) are thought to play a key role in inducing and controlling phenotypic tissue formation. In conclusion, modern in vitro approaches open new avenues for the development of vital tissue replacements for the clinic. Tissues can be repaired with the patient's own cells eventually leaving no residual artificial materials. Tissue engineering further provides new approaches for in vitro models of the extracellular matrix or diseases which mainly affect this matrix such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

The biomaterials scientist can make use of these 'natural' design processes by mimicking the extracellular matrix, the primary natural scaffolding material. Previous studies have documented the propensity of acid soluble type I collagen to self-assemble in vitro and form microscopic collagen fibrils with D periodic banding analogous to native fibrils. Recently, our laboratory extended the in vitro fibrillogenesis process to self-assemble macroscopic fibers from solutions of acid extracted type I collagen. These fibers may serve as scaffolding material for a variety of soft and hard tissue replacements. Results of mechanical analyses demonstrated that the self-assembled collagen fibers, 60-120 mu m in diameter, have dry tensile properties comparable with native, aligned fibrous tissue and wet tensile properties which are superior to similarly produced collagen fibers from insoluble type I collagen. Results of the birefringence analysis conducted in this study suggest that this technique is useful for correlating the degree of fibrillar alignment and packing with the mechanical properties of fibrous collagen scaffolds. Preliminary ultrastructural findings show that self-assembled collagen fibers contain aligned collagen fibrils with diameter distributions similar to native collagen fibers. Additionally, the uniaxial alignment of fibrils in collagen fibers self-assembled from soluble collagen was greater than similar fibrils observed in collagen fibers produced from disrupted, insoluble cerium.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH, DEPT PATHOL, DIV BIOMAT, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08854 USA",,,,"Pins, George/0000-0002-8844-8074",,,,28,41,41,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,,,MAT SCI ENG C-BIO S,Mater.

Movement of the impression and excessive seating pressure during this transition can cause distortion in the impressions. The purpose of this study is to determine if the impression distortion is related to movement during setting or to distortion of the putty phase in the two-step impressioning technique, A master model of a maxillary quadrant of teeth was impressed using four different procedures: 1) one-step technique without movement (1S-NM); 2) one-step technique with movement (1S-M); 3) two-step technique without movement (2S-NM); and 4) two-step technique with movement (2S-M). An artificial oral environment and surface analysis technique of the Minnesota Dental Research Center for Biomaterials and Biomechanics were used to produce the impressions and measure their accuracy. A digitized image of the first premolar of the master model was aligned with a digitized image of the first premolar of each epoxy model using AnSur. The root mean squared difference (RMS) between the aligned images is a measure of the distortion. The corresponding RMS values for the different methods were: 1S-NM = 23.7 +/- 9.21; 1S-M = 20.4 +/- 3.9; 2S-NM = 20.5 +/- 7.7; 2S-M = 21.3 +/- 4.4. Statistical analysis using a two-way analysis of variance showed no difference at the 0.05 level of significance. Pairwise comparison using the Tukey method showed that neither technique (one-step vs two-step) nor movement is a significant factor. These results showed that low seating pressure will not cause any greater distortions in the two-step impression technique than in the one-step technique, and minor movement during the setting of the impression material will not cause distortion.","UNIV MINNESOTA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL SCI,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455","LEE, IK (reprint author), UNIV MINNESOTA,SCH DENT,DEPT RESTORAT SCI,4-215 MOOS TOWER,515 DELAWARE ST SE,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455, USA.",,,,,,,9,18,19,0,0,UNIV WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,"SCHOOL DENTISTRY SM-57, SEATTLE, WA 98195",0361-7734,,,OPER DENT,Oper.

Dilute solution viscometry in both the systems of theta-composition and DMF at 30 degrees C confirmed the viscosity-molecular mass relationship is well outside the Gaussian behavior, The chain parameters found on the basis of wormlike cylinder model were; M(L)=473 nm(-1), persistence length q=1.8 nm, and cylinder diameter d=0.92 nm, which appeared slightly higher than those of bisphenol A polycarbonate. These led to a conclusion that the chains can be regarded as semiflexible with less stiff chain character.","INHA UNIV,DEPT POLYMER SCI & ENGN,INCHON 402751,SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,POLYMER SOC KOREA,SEOUL,"ROOM 601, HATCHON BUILDING, 831 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-792, SOUTH KOREA",1225-5947,,,KOREA POLYM J,Korea Polym.

Several unit operations can be applied, e.g. filtration, centrifugation and ultrafiltration. On a production scale at DSM, filtration was used to separate the biocatalyst, but its performance was not satisfactory. Therefore, research was carried out in order to improve filtration and to develop an alternative separation process, in this case ultrafiltration. In filtration the use of a body feed of filter aid is required to avoid formation of a slimy layer of cells and cell debris on the filter cloth, which would cause a dramatic decrease in the filtration rate. A precoat of filter aid proved not to be necessary. The porous cake formed by gradual deposition of filter aid on the filter favours a high filtration rate and retention of biomaterials. The best results were obtained with a high grade of perlite, at a concentration of 10 to 15 kg/m(3), for a biocatalyst concentration of 4.3 kg/m(3). The observed average filtration rate for a batch time of 80 min and at a pressure of 2.5 bar was 580 kg/m(2) h. The filtrate was not entirely clear: the protein retention was 50%. This means that the proteins remaining in the filtrate must be removed in another process step, e.g. carbon adsorption. By means of ultrafiltration, a very clear permeate was obtained as all the cells, cell debris and enzymes were retained by the membrane (molecular weight cut-off 25 000 Da). The highest flux was observed at a high cross-flow velocity, 3.9 m/s. At low transmembrane pressure, 3.4 bar, the flux had approximately the same value as at 10.7 bar. From our experiments, it can be concluded that once a fouling or gel layer is formed, it is stable and it will not be removed by increasing the cross-flow velocity, lowering the pressure, etc. At a concentration factor of 10 and a batch time of 6 h the average flux observed was 25 kg/m(2) h. The protein retention was approximately 99%. The investment and operational costs are lower for ultrafiltration than for pressure filtration. However, due to a process alteration at a later date, neither an UF unit nor a filtration unit were required. The negative effects of the presence of enzymes and cell debris in the product solution were compensated by using carbon adsorption, which was already installed for the purification of the product.",,"MEINDERSMA, GW (reprint author), DSM RES BV,POB 18,6160 MD GELEEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,18,4,4,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Cauchy stress and Lagrangian strain were calculated for both membrane and three-dimensional cases. The leaflets exhibited nonlinearly elastic, anisotropic behavior. Both anterior and posterior leaflets were less extensible in the circumferential than in the radial direction under equibiaxial stretch, with stress ratios of 5.7 and 4.3, respectively. The posterior leaflets exhibited greater extensibility in both directions and lower circumferential posttransitional moduli (ranges 690-820 vs. 2,500-3,200 N/m for anterior). This larger posterior extensibility may be due to the greater number of chordal attachments, which provide additional mechanical stability to this structure. Coupling of radial and circumferential mechanical behavior was evidenced by the response to different stretch protocols, indicating a complex microstructural coupling between individual collagen fibers or bundles. These are the first biaxial data for mitral valves and are a foundation far the development of a more detailed quantitative material description.","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, BALTIMORE, MD 21205 USA","MAYNEWMAN, K (reprint author), JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, SCH MED,DEPT MED,DIV CARDIOL,930 TRAYLOR BLDG, 1721 E MADISON ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21205 USA.",,,,,,,31,113,113,0,9,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0363-6135,1522-1539,,AM J PHYSIOL-HEART C,Am.

An autogenous bone graft is the optimal material of choice, however its use is problematic due to donor site morbidity, sparse amounts and uncontrolled resorption. Immunological responses and risk of viral contamination of allogenous and xenogenous bone materials make the use of these materials questionable. Healing and degradation of alloplastic materials are inconsistent with subsequent restricted use. The principle of guided tissue regeneration excluding soft tissue cells from a certain area is not alone sufficient to insure complete bony healing. Recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins have with success been added as adjuncts to already known biomaterials. In the future, inductive materials together with a suitable carrier and a biodegradable membrane may be the choice of bone substitute used within cranio-maxillofacial and orthopaedic surgery.","UNIV COPENHAGEN HOSP, RIGSHOSP, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK","AABOE, M (reprint author), UNIV COPENHAGEN, FAC HLTH SCI, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG, 20 NORRE ALLE, DK-2200 COPENHAGEN N, DENMARK.",,,,,,,130,66,69,1,18,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0266-4356,1532-1940,,BRIT J ORAL MAX SURG,Br.

Hydration and degradation behavior varied linearly with the ratios of CNBr to dextran. The physical properties were dependent on the molecular weights of the dextrans used in the preparations. In contrast to epichlorohydrin crosslinked dextran microspheres that are resistant to hydrolysis and only degrade enzymatically, the described microspheres degrade more rapidly by simple hydrolysis of the iminocarbonate bonds that constitute the microspheres.

In these novel polymers, non-toxic desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters are being used as monomers in place of industrial diphenols such as Bisphenol A. The high cost and limited availability of desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters have prevented the large-scale preparation of these polymers. To address this problem, the following four peptide coupling techniques were explored: dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (DCC/HOBt), ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino)propyl carbodiimide hydrochloride salt (EDCI . HCl), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) active ester, and p-nitrophenol (pNP) active ester. Desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine hexyl ester (DTH) was used as a model compound. DCC/HOBt led to a crude product that required column chromatography for purification. The water soluble coupling agent EDCI HCl made it possible to replace column chromatography by precipitation/extraction in aqueous media. This alleviated possible environmental concerns about the use of organic solvents. Furthermore, EDCI . HCl did not require the addition of an auxiliary nucleophile such as HOBt in the reaction mixture. The use of the NHS active ester of Dat also produced DTH of sufficient purity, but was less cost effective than EDCI . HCl. The pNP active ester produced DTH which could not be easily purified. Based on these results, the effectiveness of EDCI . HCl was verified by the 100 g synthesis of the ethyl, butyl, hexyl and octyl esters of desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine. All of these monomers could be polymerized to high polymers. Overall, the EDCI .

This article describes an in vitro dynamic perfusion system that allows four reactors containing 24 1-in. catheter samples (6 per reactor) to be simultaneously perfused at a constant flow rate by synthetic urine. A common urease-producing urinary pathogen, Proteus mirabilis, was maintained at a level of 10(6) colony-forming units/mL for 7 days in the dynamic perfusion reactors. The pH and bacterial population were monitored every 24 h and the percentage of encrustation on latex and hydrogel-coated commercial catheter materials gave reproducible results in three different runs, 15.2 +/- 3.65% and 13.8 +/- 2.58%, respectively. A major issue of inlet clogging due to ascending bacteria or ammonia has been rectified using a dismountable inlet assembly. An incubator coupled with a cooling system allowed accurate temperature maintenance of 37 degrees C in all four reactors. Results from scanning electron microscopy of some latex samples are also presented.

In the present study, our goal was to extend these findings to an in vivo test environment on biomaterials. The subcutaneous cage-implant system was modified for mice to elucidate IL-4 participation in mediating FBGC formation in vivo. Exudate leukocyte concentrations from cages containing poly(etherurethane urea) (PEUU A') and empty cage controls indicated a similar inflammatory response that turned toward resolution by 14 days postimplantation, thus confirming the applicability of the cage-implant system in mice. FBGC kinetic analysis showed that the formation of mouse FBGCs occurs through the fusion of adherent macrophages at a constant rate up to 14 days of implantation. Purified goat anti-mouse IL-4 neutralizing antibody (IL4Ab) or normal goat nonspecific control IgG (gtIgG) at various concentrations, or recombinant murine IL-4 (muIL4) was injected into the implanted cages containing PEUU A' every 2 days for 7 days. The injection of IL4Ab significantly decreased the FBGC density on PEUU A' cage-implanted in mice, when compared with the nonspecific IgG or PBS injection controls. Conversely, the FBGC density was significantly increased by the injection of muIL4 when compared with nonspecific IgG and PBS injection controls. Adherent macrophage density, FBGC morphology, FBGC average size, and size distribution were not significantly different among IL4Ab, nonspecific control gtIgG, muIL4, and PBS control groups. Our data suggest that IL-4 participates in FBGC formation on biomaterials in vivo.

In this paper we determine the cytocompatibility of acyl azide- and GTA-treated pericardium in vitro, by an organotypic chick aorta culture technique developed for the evaluation of the propensity of vascular cells (both endothelial and smooth muscle cells) to migrate and grow on the surface of biomaterials. We first examined pericardium stabilization as a function of GTA concentration and time, so that we could minimize residual GTA molecules in the material. Treatment for 72 h with 0.05% GTA was optimal for thermal stabilization of the pericardium with a denaturation temperature (T-d) Of 86.8 degrees C, providing similar results to treatment with 0.6% GTA for 4 h (T-d = 85.1 degrees C). Pericardium treated in this way was, however, poorly cytocompatible with little vascular cell migration and growth when compared with tissues treated by the acyl azide methods. The best results were obtained with 0.5% DPPA; treated tissues showed a high level of cross-linking (T-d = 82.4 degrees C) and three-fold increases in cell growth and migration over those in a non-toxic control.","INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS,UPR 412,F-69367 LYON 07,FRANCE; COLETICA,F-69007 LYON,FRANCE; UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELLULAIRE EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 07,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE",,,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060",,,,29,45,46,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,SEP,1995.0,16,13,,,,,1003,1008,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)94908-4,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,RM797,WOS:A1995RM79700007,8580252.0,,,,2019-02-25

The estimation of platelet adhesion and activation was performed with two enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD42b (GP Ib) and CD 62 (GMP 140 or P-Selectin). The applicability of EIA was first demonstrated in microtitre plates coated with fibrinogen. The thrombogenic substrate showed that platelet adhesion and activation reached a plateau level within 30 min. The use of EIA for testing biomaterials was demonstrated with polymeric reference materials where a differentiation of materials with respect to adhesion and activation was achieved. To validate the EIA scanning electron microscopy was applied and confirmed the different extent of adhesion and activation of platelets on reference materials. In addition, polyurethaneureas, based on 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polytetramethylene glycols, with different hard segment content and composition were investigated. It was found that both adhesion and activation were not simply dependent on the hard segment content but also on the hard segment composition. To get more insight into the mechanism of this process, two EIAs for the binding of fibrinogen using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were developed. There it was shown that the adhesion and activation of platelets on polyurethaneureas was not simply dependent on the total amount of adsorbed fibrinogen but rather on its conformation, indicated by the binding of the monoclonal antibody directed vs the gamma-chain of fibrinogen.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH DENT,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH MED,INST ROENTGENDIAGNOST INTERVENT RADIOL,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY; BIOCOMPATIBLES LTD,UXBRIDGE UB8 3PQ,MIDDX,ENGLAND",,,"Seifert, Barbara/K-7569-2012","Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,34,42,45,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,SEP,1995.0,16,13,,,,,1009,1015,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)94909-5,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,RM797,WOS:A1995RM79700008,8580253.0,,,,2019-02-25

For this purpose, porcine articular cartilage was incubated with phosphate buffer containing the corresponding amounts of NaN3 or merthiolate. Supernatants were assayed using NMR spectroscopy, and the content of soluble saccharides was determined using the dye Alcian blue. The results obtained clearly indicate that merthiolate is more effective than sodium azide. This makes the former a more suitable preserving agent for the storage of cartilage.

Reactive injection processing of polymers, polymer alloys and polymer composites, and reactive extrusion modification of polymers illustrate processing which involves molecular organisation in the polymer chain to achieve desired product properties, and also larger scale organisation of the polymer. Solid phase processing techniques demonstrate organisation of already formed polymer chains. Orientation techniques and hot compaction of high modulus polymers show the potential for enhancing the properties of certain polymers, through controlled processing. Adding reinforcement forms part of the same strategy as solid phase deformation, namely adding value to (or compensating for) existing polymer properties, and novel thermoplastic composites, including biomaterials, are discussed in this context. Techniques involving manipulation of polarity in the polymer chain, for potential use of the materials in 'devices' are presented briefly. Finally, the significance of process control for melt processing of polymers is discussed.","UNIV LEEDS,IRC POLYMER SCI & TECHNOL,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND; UNIV DURHAM,IRC POLYMER SCI & TECHNOL,DURHAM,ENGLAND","COATES, PD (reprint author), UNIV BRADFORD,IRC POLYMER SCI & TECHNOL,BRADFORD BD7 1DP,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,,"Coates, Philip/0000-0001-5193-5621",,,,62,3,3,1,3,INST CHEMICAL ENGINEERS,RUGBY,"165-171 RAILWAY TERRACE GEORGE E DAVIS BLDG, RUGBY, ENGLAND CV21 3HQ",0263-8762,,,CHEM ENG RES DES,Chem.

The purpose of this study was to compare a methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) dye colorimeiric method with the standard Cr-51 assay as methods of assessing cytotoxicity of denial materials. Methods. Two MTT-based colorimetric formals, test tube and 96-well microplate methods, were compared to the Cr-51 release assay. A series of eight dental materials were evaluated. Cytotoxicity profiles were determined for each test material. A TC50 value (Toxic Concentration required to kill 50% of the cells) was determined for each biomaterial, and these results were used to make statistical comparisons between the methods. Results. The three methods were statistically correlated (p < 0.005) by comparison of the eight samples tested. That is, the same rank in toxicity was given by the two tetrazolium sample formats and the Cr-51 method. Significance. The MTT assay was found to have several advantages in comparison to the current standard Cr-51 release assay. Optimized in the 96 well format, complete dose response curves and greater sample comparisons can be made rapidly, making the MTT method more economical in time and cost. Furthermore, the MTT method is based on intracellular biochemical changes, measuring cell viability rather than cell morbidity, and has lower detectable limits than the Cr-51 release method. There is also less detector chemical binding interference than encountered in the Cr-51 release method.","UNIV MISSOURI, DIV PHARMACOL, TOXICORE LAB, KANSAS CITY, MO 64108 USA; UNIV MISSOURI, SCH DENT, KANSAS CITY, MO 64108 USA; MIDWEST RES INST, KANSAS CITY, KS USA",,,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09696],,,15,28,28,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0109-5641,1879-0097,,DENT MATER,Dent.

All techniques immersed vascular grafts in rotating blood. In the gravimetric analysis, the weight of adherent thrombi was recorded at 2 min intervals for 20 min. In the torque analysis, a microviscometer continuously recorded the amount of torque developed as the graft rotated for 20 min. In the thrombin analysis, the blood sample was analyzed for fibrinopeptide A production indicating fibrinogen cleavage. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were treated by removal of air nuclei (denucleation), binding of heparin, or binding of polyethylene oxide (PEO). The gravimetric analysis determined that the time at which each group experienced clot initiation was as follows: control after 6 min, denucleation after 14 min, heparin after 18 min, and PEO after 10 min. Similarly, in the torque analysis all treatment groups significantly delayed the initial increase in torque from 8.0 min for control to 12.5 min for denucleation (P < .01), >20 min for heparin (P <.01), and 12 min for PEO (P <.05). The thrombin analysis determined that coagulation activity was reduced relative to control at 12 min with the denucleation group (P <.05) and heparin group (P <.01) and at 18 min with all treatment groups (P <.01). The similarity of results among the techniques increases confidence that each measurement accurately predicts in vitro thrombogenicity.

Quantitative measurement of specific aspects of this local host response to different but well-characterized biomaterial surfaces provides a crucial link in the understanding of the overall phenomenon of implant biocompatibility. A system has been devised for in vitro examination of responses of cells to controlled but independent changes in both the chemistry and morphology of polystyrene (PS) tissue culture surfaces. Micromachined silicon wafers wore used as templates to solvent-cast PS replicas [using 0, 1, or 2 wt % styrene (S) monomer additions] with either none, 0.5- or 5.0-mu m-deep surface grooves arranged in a radial array. When all possible morphologies were combined with all possible polymers, nine model biomaterial surfaces (MBSs) were produced. The chemical characteristics of the MBSs were determined using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, secondary ion mas's spectroscopy, and contact angle techniques and were found to be distinct. The types and amount of proteins that adsorb onto these surfaces from serum containing media were examined and found to consist of multiple molecular layers of relatively uniform composition. Self-contained tissue culture vessels formed from the MBSs were capable of supporting the growth of confluent cultures of rat calvarial cells. The model biomaterial system described here can be used to examine how simultaneous stimuli resulting from the chemical and morphological characteristics of a test material may influence biologic responses. Such multifactorial biocompatibility research is needed to properly document material-host interactions.

H-1 NMR relaxation measurements (spin-lattice, T-1, and spin-spin, T-2, relaxation times) were performed to better understand the molecular dynamics of polysiloxane chains in implants. After 1 year of implantation in animals, changes in the H-1 T-2 relaxation times and the NMR spectra were observed in polydimethylsiloxane, Silastic(R) sheets and chin implants, while these measurements remain unchanged in finger joints. Very small amounts of fat were detected in all types of silicone rubber implants at the end of the implantation period.

To evaluate the effect of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) surface on the binding of monoclonal antibodies against the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) by adherent endothelial cells, an in vitro bioassay was developed. STUDY DESIGN: Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown to confluency on fibronectin-pretreated ePTFE and on fibronectin-pretreated polystyrene culture flasks used as controls, Cells were assayed for size, density, viability, and binding of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. Human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were then cocultured with HUVEC adherent to ePTFE and control polystyrene and HUVEC were assayed for the binding of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. RESULTS. The adherence of HSVEC and HUVEC to ePTFE resulted in a twofold increase in the binding of monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 compared with control at 48 hours (p<0.005). The addition of PBLs to the adherent HUVEC resulted in a four- to eightfold increase in anti-ICAM-1 antibody binding on ePTFE and polystyrene, respectively, at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence of endothelial cells to ePTFE results in an increase in the binding of anti-IC;AM-l antibodies. Coculture of adherent HUVEC and PBLs results in a marked increase in the number of cells binding ICAM-1 antibodies. These data support the conclusion that ePTFE is associated with the activation of adherent cells, which is one aspect of a multicellular inflammatory response.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT SURG,DIV GEN SURG,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,0,AMER COLL SURGEONS,CHICAGO,"54 EAST ERIE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60611",1072-7515,,,J AM COLL SURGEONS,J.

On the contrary, the polycation carrying side-chain cetyl fragments forms a more stable complex with liposomes, probably due to the incorporation of cetyl fragments into the lipid bilayer. In this case, the polyanion cannot displace the polycation from the surface, the liposome-polycation-polyanion ternary complex being formed.

What remains is acellular matrix with the structural proteins well conserved and normally arranged. Canine arteries extracted to acellular matrix were implanted as coronary artery bypass allografts in a canine model, without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and compared with autogenous saphenous veins. Of nine pilot acellular matrix implants, four were patent, as compared with four of seven saphenous vein grafts. All occlusions in both graft types occurred acutely soon after implantation, with almost all patent grafts followed up for 6 months. The acellular matrix allografts showed no inflammation and only minimal cellular repopulation. This model needs further development, but appears promising for preclinical evaluation. Canine aortic and pulmonic valves extracted to acellular matrix using a modification of our extraction process, eliminating the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate, were implanted heterotopically as allografts in the left main pulmonary artery in dogs, a location chosen to avoid the need for cardiopulmonary bypass. At 1 month, two-dimensional echocardiography of six implants showed leaflet motion and 3- to 5-mm Hg transvalvular gradients. Explant histology of four valves at 1 month showed no inflammation, cellular repopulation at the base of the valve, and partial endothelialization. Although much remains to be done, the acellular matrix process has the potential to produce a coronary artery bypass graft with performance similar to that of autogenous saphenous vein and a bioprosthetic heart valve with performance similar to cryopreserved homografts, both from an abundant supply of nonhuman tissues.","UNIV TORONTO,CTR BIOMAT,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT CELLULAR & MOLEC PATHOL,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT SURG,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT MET,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT MAT SCI,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; HOSP SICK CHILDREN,DEPT PATHOL,TORONTO,ON M5G 1X8,CANADA; HOSP SICK CHILDREN,DIV CARDIOVASC RES,TORONTO,ON M5G 1X8,CANADA","WILSON, GJ (reprint author), TORONTO HOSP,DIV CARDIOVASC SURG,ROOM CCRW 1-885,200 ELIZABETH ST,TORONTO,ON M5G 2C4,CANADA.",,,,,,,17,105,112,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0003-4975,,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

The obtained data showed that calcined bone is well tolerated and does not cause acute chronic inflammatory reactions. Osteoid tissue, tightly adhered to the implant, appears within 2 we of the operation, while after 6 weeks newly formed bone surrounds and infiltrates the implant. Of greater note, the detection of good adhesion between bone and implant ultrastructurally is demonstrated by the absence of fibrillar connective tissue at the interface.

The approach is essentially based on a photochemical immobilization reaction. Two new conjugate molecules, compounds 2 and 3, were prepared. They consist of (i) dipyridamole, a well-known inhibitor of platelet activation, and a vasodilating drug with clinical application, for instance before and during pecutaneous transluminar coronary angioplasty (Dottering); and (ii) an aryl azide, a moiety that exhibits marked photoreactivity. In 2, the dipyridamole unit is directly linked to the aryl azide (via an ester bond), while a short spacer chain separates both units in 3. Upon irradiation of 2 or 3, adsorbed onto the polyurethane foil, the aryl azide is converted into a highly reactive species which reacts with a nucleophilic group on the polymer surface. In this way, the dipyridamole is covalently linked to the polymer. The underlying principle is also used in photoaffinity labeling, a well-known technique in biochemical studies on enzyme structure and function. From UN extinction experiments it could be deduced that the surface density of immobilized 2 is 4.9 nmol/cm(2). The surface density for 3 was 14.6 nmol/cm(2). The surfaces were subjected to an in vitro thrombin generation assay. This assay gives a valuable impression about the hemocompatibility of artificial surfaces. These experiments revealed that the clotting times were substantially prolonged as a result of the photoimmobilization of dipyridamole. This was especially the case for immobilized 3. This effect cannot be readily explained. Possibly, the enhanced activity of immobilized 3 is due to the spacer chain. An alternative explanation is that the surface density is larger for 3 than for 2. In addition, the photomodified surfaces were incubated with platelet-rich blood plasma (37 degrees C, 30 min) and subsequently examined by scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of the blood platelets adhered to the surface also showed that hemocompatibility increased in the order untreated polyurethane < polyurethane with immobilized 2 < polyurethane with immobilized 3. Future work will concentrate on evaluation of the role of the spacer (length, hydrophilicity, etc.), as well as on the possible use of this approach with respect to the construction of biomaterials with improved in vivo biocompatibility, in particular hemocompatibility.

Degradable nonporous, porous, and ''combi'' (porous with a nonporous layer on one side) poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) films and nondegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and (porous) expanded PTFE (e-PTFE) were used. Contact angles measurements indicate that PLLA is more hydrophillic than PTFE. Assessment of the inflammatory response was performed after various periods of implantation (up till 180 days), with both conventional light microscopy and immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The inflammatory response observed initially can largely be considered as part of the wound healing reaction, and up till day 40 the inflammatory response against PLLA was minimally more intense than against PTFE (porous as well as nonporous). From day 40 on, the PLLA films provoke more intense inflammatory response as compared to the PTFE films. Both porous PLLA and the porous side of the ''combi'' PLLA film provoke a more intense inflammatory response than nonporous PLLA and the nonporous side of the ''combi'' PLLA film, respectively. In general, PTFE and e-PTFE films provoke an inflammatory response which is minimally more intense than the one provoked by the sham operation. Almost no ingrowth of tissue was observed in the porous e-PTFE films. In contrast, there was abundant tissue ingrowth in and an inflammatory response against porous PLLA. It can be concluded that biodegradable PLLA films provoke a more intense inflammatory response than nondegradable PTFE films. Also, porosity enhances the inflammatory response. However, porosity enhances the inflammatory response only when the wettability of a biomaterial permits cellular ingrowth.

Derivatization of Co-Cr-Mo samples with organic and aqueous solutions of gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) resulted in a concentration-dependent number of reactive NH2 groups on the surface available for coupling to protein. The enzyme trypsin was used as a model biomolecule to investigate the effect of immobilization on proteolytic activity. Trypsin was coupled to the silanized samples by formation of Schiffs base linkages via glutaraldehyde. The nature of the interaction between trypsin and biomaterial was then probed by treatment with concentrated guanidine hydrochloride (GuHC1) and urea. Residual activity (following treatment with chaotropic agents) of trypsin immobilized on silanized Co-Cr-Mo was dependent both on the nature of the silane solution and on the type of chaotropic agent. Organic silanization with APS required a minimum density of approximately 49 NH2 per nm(2) of nominal surface area (> 0.021 M APS) for residual activity of immobilized trypsin. For aqueous silanization, approximately 5.4 NH2/nm(2) (0.51 M APS) resulted in maximal residual trypsin activity. Treatment with GuHCI removed more trypsin activity from Co-Cr-Mo samples silanized with organic solutions of APS than did treatment with urea. On the contrary, with aqueous silanization the samples possessed greater residual activity following treatment with GuHCI than following urea. Compared to simple adsorption with protein onto Co-Cr-Mo, both methods of silanization with APS resulted in superior residual immobilized enzyme activity.

All available free amine groups had reacted with GA to form a Schiff base within 5 min after the start of the reaction under the conditions studied (0.5% (w/w) GA). Before crosslinks are formed the hydrolysable Schiff bases initially present were stabilized by further reaction with GA molecules. An increase in shrinkage temperature (T-s) from 56 degrees C for non-crosslinked DSC (N-DSC) to 78 degrees C for GA crosslinked DSC (G-DSC) was achieved after crosslinking for 1 h. From the relationship between the free amine group content and the T-s during crosslinking it was concluded that higher GA concentrations and longer reaction times will result in the introduction of pendant-GA-related molecules rather than crosslinks. After 24 h crosslinking an average uptake of 3 GA molecules per reacted amine group was found. No increase in the tensile strength of the materials was observed after crosslinking, which may be a result of formation of crosslinks within the fibres rather than in between fibres. Aligning of the fibres by applying a pre-strain to the samples and subsequent crosslinking yielded materials with an increased tensile strength.","UNIV TWENTE, DEPT CHEM TECHNOL, 7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,39,254,257,0,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Tunica vaginalis, dermis, dorsal vein and lyophilized dura have been used for this purpose. Traditionally, these graft biomaterials have been sutured to the tunica albuginea. We assessed the feasibility, short-term safety and efficacy of diode laser tissue welding using albumin based solder and indocyanine green dye to perform patch graft corporoplasty in the dog. Ten animals were subjected to bilateral transverse excision of 1 x 2 cm. sections of tunica albuginea. Corporoplasty was performed using grafts composed of saphenous vein (5) or tunica vaginalis (5). Microsurgical repair with 7-zero polydioxanone suture (10) was compared to contralateral laser welded repair (10) by recording operative time, initial and short-term bursting pressures (mean plus or minus standard deviation) and histological analysis. Operative time on the laser side (9.8 +/- 2.3 minutes) was significantly shorter (p <0.05) than on the suture side (17.1 +/- 5.1 minutes). Leak pressures, initially (laser 105.7 +/- 23.8 mm. Hg versus suture 35.3 +/- 8.0 mm. Hg), at 3 to 5 days (greater than 333.3 +/- 62.4 mm. Hg versus 136.6 +/- 39.4 mm. Hg) and at 7 to 10 days (greater than 397.8 +/- 39.8 mm. Hg versus 191.5 +/- 46.4 mm. Hg) were higher (p <0.05) in the laser side compared to controls. Graft failure (necrosis) occurred in 3 repairs (2 laser on day 4 and 1 suture on day 10). Viable tissue with minimal differences in foreign body reaction between groups was observed in the remaining grafts. We conclude that laser welded patch graft corporoplasty using tunica vaginalis or vein is easy to perform, and provides excellent initial and short-term leak pressures. The use of laser welding in conjunction with suturing may be beneficial in corporoplasty for congenital or acquired penile curvature.","COLUMBIA UNIV COLL PHYS & SURG,CHILDRENS & BABIES HOSP,NEW YORK,NY 10032","KIRSCH, AJ (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV COLL PHYS & SURG,DEPT UROL,J BENTLEY SQUIER UROL CLIN,NEW YORK,NY 10032, USA.",,,,,,,24,6,6,0,2,WILLIAMS & WILKINS,BALTIMORE,"351 WEST CAMDEN ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21201-2436",0022-5347,,,J UROLOGY,J.

The networks were reinforced by the creation of national and European Meetings, the support of the EC in projects such as Brite Euram. The interdisciplinary nature of the teaching is critical; permanent education and in-job training are imperatives. University researchers in materials science should spin off ideas into campus companies or small industries.

Contrary to protein crystal growth studies which indicate substantial increases in organization and size in microgravity, the gravitational environment had no repeatable effect on collagen and fibrin fiber diameters and matrix porosity. However, fibrin gels formed in microgravity appeared more homogeneous than ground samples. Changes in temperature and concentration of both protein and buffer had substantial effects on fiber diameters and material porosity for both collagen and fibrin. Temperature experiments were performed over the range 23.8 to 39 degrees C for fibrin and 22 to 33 degrees C for collagen. Thrombin concentration was varied from 0.02 to 0.10 units/ml for fibrin experiments and buffer concentration was varied by means of a dialysis membrane for collagen experiments. Consequently, the temperature and concentration controls developed far flight experiments are being considered for their potential in developing fibrin and collagen based materials with well-defined microscopic structures.

The histologic and biomechanic characteristics of posterior lumbar fusion with varying rigidity of a novel internal fixation construct in the rabbit were analyzed. Objectives. To evaluate this rabbit model for future studies of fusion augmentation. Summary of Background Data. Previous studies in goats and dogs showed internal fixation enhances spinal arthrodesis. Methods. Twenty eight New Zealand white rabbits underwent a posterior midline fusion from L4 to L6. Some animals received autogenous iliac crest bone graft, stabilized by wiring the superior facets bilaterally, and supplementation with polymethylmethacrylate. The experimental groups were iliac crest bone graft with either no fixation, wire fixation, or wire and polymethylmethacrylate fixation; and no graft and either no fixation, wire fixation, or wire and polymethylmethacrylate fixation. Animals were killed 2 months after surgery, and the specimens were nondestructively tested biomechanically for stiffness in six modes (flexion, extension, left and right bending, compression, and torsion) and histologically for evidence of fusion, revascularization, and new bone formation. Results. Fusions with either wire or wire and polymethylmethacrylate fixation were significantly stiffer than those without fixation (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the iliac crest bone graft and wire group and the iliac crest bone graft, wire, and polymethylmethacrylate group in the modes tested. Nine of 14 motion segments receiving the stiffest construct (iliac crest bone graft, wire, and polymethylmethacrylate) had evidence of solid bony fusion. None of the 12 motion segments receiving iliac crest bone graft and wire had evidence of bony fusion, but five had a fibrocartilage union with some ossification present. Eight of 12 motion segments receiving iliac crest bone graft and no fixation had predominantly fibrous unions with some fibrocartilage, and only one motion segment of 12 showed bony fusion. Conclusions. This study suggests that more rigid fixation produces more successful union in rabbit posterior spinal fusion. This model maybe useful in evaluating the ability of various biomaterials to augment spinal arthrodesis.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,0,30,32,1,3,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,JUL 15,1995.0,20,14,,,,,1561,1567,,10.1097/00007632-199507150-00003,,,,7,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,RK233,WOS:A1995RK23300003,7570170.0,,,,2019-02-25

Using hTM immobilized cellulose hollow fibers, a small scale dialyzer was assembled and its antithrombogenic activity was studied using human blood. As a result, it was revealed that the immobilized hTM still has co-enzymatic activity for activation of Protein C and anticoagulant activity. The coagulation time of the human blood passed through the hTM immobilized small dialyzer was effectively prolonged.

In particular, the antibody-detectable (that is, conformationally intact) bound fibrinogen, but not the total amount of adsorbed fibrinogen, is correlated with platelet reactivity. In this work, the authors quantified the adsorbed plasma protein distribution inside the left ventricular assist device. They also evaluated the effect of wall shear stress on protein adsorption and conformational change of adsorbed fibrinogen. Conformational change of adsorbed fibrinogen was measured by exposing the fibrinogen preadsorbed polyurethane to three anti-fibrinogen monoclonal antibodies; the 134B-29 detectable alpha 566-580 domain of fibrinogen was increased with increasing concentration of adsorbed fibrinogen, whereas the other two fibrinogen domains were almost saturated when increasing the concentration of adsorbed fibrinogen. The adsorbed amount of total fibrinogen and monoclonal antibody detectable fibrinogen was decreased with increasing shear rate. Results of in vivo plasma protein adsorption on polyurethane surfaces disclosed that the adsorbed amount of fibrinogen, as well as albumin and globulin, was also decreased with increasing shear rate. In conclusion, less protein was adsorbed in the higher shear region and the effect of shear level on fibrinogen adsorption and its conformational change was strongly dependent upon the surface characteristics of the biomaterials, The monoclonal antibody 134B-29 against the 566-580 domain of fibrinogen was the most reactive with the fibrinogen adsorbed on polyurethane surfaces in this experiment.","SEOUL NATL UNIV HOSP,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,SEOUL 110744,SOUTH KOREA","SEOUL NATL UNIV HOSP,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,28 YUNGUN DONG,SEOUL 110744,SOUTH KOREA.",,,,,,,0,6,6,1,2,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-SEP,1995.0,41,3,,,,,M384,M388,,10.1097/00002480-199507000-00036,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,TC541,WOS:A1995TC54100037,8573830.0,,,,2019-02-25

The microstructure and crystal structure were analysed by the techniques of SEM, EPMA, TEM and XRD. The relationship between the mechanical strength of the sintered bioceramics and the Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O dopant was examined in terms of the presence of NaCa(PO3)(3), grain growth and abnormal grain coalescence while the dopant increased. Preliminary in vivo evaluation was studied by rabbit femur condyle implantation. There was no inflammation or any toxic sign during the experimental period. The histological section of intraosseous implantation revealed that the new bone deposited directly on the surface of the material in the fourth week after operation. The implant gradually decreased in volume and was replaced by the surrounding regenerated bone in the rabbit condyle in vivo environment. The results led us to conclude that the developed material has great potential as a biodegradable bone substitute.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,CTR BIOMED ENGN,TAIPEI,TAIWAN; NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAIPEI,TAIWAN",,,,"SUN, JUI-SHENG/0000-0001-5142-8777",,,,25,48,49,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUL,1995.0,16,10,,,,,793,802,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)99642-Y,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,RE498,WOS:A1995RE49800007,7492710.0,,,,2019-02-25

These cells exhibit numerous metabolic functions necessary for the maintenance of homeostasis. The critical role of endothelium in maintaining normal blood vessel function is exemplified by the poor clinical performance of small diameter polymeric vascular grafts which fail due, in part, to the lack of a functional endothelium on the lumenal surface. Extensive research has explored the potentiality of transplanting endothelial cells onto polymeric vascular grafts to improve graft function. Several critical issues have been explored including the source of endothelial cells for transplantation, the interaction of endothelium with polymers and the healing process of endothelial cell transplanted grafts. The future of endothelial cell transplantation will also include the use of these cells as vehicles for genetic engineering.",,"WILLIAMS, SK (reprint author), UNIV ARIZONA, ARIZONA HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT SURG, SURG RES SECT, 1501 N CAMPBELL AVE, TUCSON, AZ 85724 USA.",,,,,,,42,61,61,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0963-6897,1555-3892,,CELL TRANSPLANT,Cell Transplant.,JUL-AUG,1995.0,4,4,,,,,401,410,,10.1016/0963-6897(95)00023-Q,,,,10,"Cell & Tissue Engineering; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Transplantation",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Transplantation,RL942,WOS:A1995RL94200008,7582571.0,,,,2019-02-25

This study was conducted to 1) measure the sensitivity of human and mouse macrophages to metal ions which are released from dental biomaterials, 2) compare these sensitivities with those of other cell types in the oral cavity, and 3) determine ii metal ions alter the metabolism and synthetic processes of these cells at lower concentrations than are required to lyse the cells. This information will help define the biological risks associated with the release of metal ions into the oral cavity. Methods. Macrophages were exposed to a range of concentrations of Ag1+, Au3+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, Pt4+, and Zn2+ for 24 h in cell culture. The concentrations which caused a 50% decrease in succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, protein production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured and compared with these values for fibroblasts and osteoblasts. Results. Most metal ions caused alteration in SDH activity and protein production at lower concentrations than were required to induce LDH release. There were exceptions to this trend, and the differences were not always statistically significant. Furthermore, although the macrophages sometimes had statistically different sensitivities to metal ions than fibroblasts or osteoblasts, these differences were less than one order of magnitude. Macrophage response to the metal ions was highly dependent on the metal ion and the species of macrophage. Significance. Macrophages react adversely to metal ions at similar concentrations as other cell types found in the oral cavity. Furthermore, the concentrations which affect cell metabolism and protein production are generally lower than those which lyse the cells. Thus, non-lethal concentrations of metal ions may alter the secretion of protein inflammatory mediators such as cytokines which direct the inflammatory responses in tissues.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL MED & SURG,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","WATAHA, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,33,58,58,0,6,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

The neutral red uptake by cells was used to count the number of cells still alive after contact with the diepoxy compounds, because this method was more sensitive in cell counting than the other four methods studied in this work. The amount of neutral red taken up by cells depended strongly on the activity of cells in comparison with other methods; only small amounts of neutral red were taken up when cells were in a low activity state even if they were still alive. The in vitro toxicity of diepoxy compounds evaluated by the neutral red method revealed a good correlation with that found by the in vivo Draize test. The in vitro cytotoxicity to a cell line of L929 was closely related to that of primary culture cells of the normal rabbit cornea epidermal cell. The toxicity of diepoxy compounds was lower as their chain was longer, probably because of the lower chemical reactivity. All the diepoxy compounds investigated in this study exhibited lower cytotoxicity than formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and a water-soluble carbodiimide.

Some samples were also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Depending on the experimental conditions (temperature and duration of treatment), about 1-2% of the surface repeated units could be functionalized without deterioration of the polymer bulk.

Thus, during the last few years much attention has been paid to hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate as potential biomaterials for bone substitute. However, the disadvantage of all proposed calcium phosphate ceramics is their low mechanical strength. Therefore, the applicability of these materials is restricted to the non-stressed regions. The ultimate good of implantation of biomaterials in the skeleton is to reach full integration of non-living implant with living bone. The material could be used, much as a bone graft, as material itself resorbs or dissolves as bone growth occurs, and the end result is new remolded bone. Ca2P2O7 is one of intermediate products of bone mineralized crystal from amorphous calcium phosphates. Ca2P2O7 doped with a certain amount of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was prepared as the developed material. In this study, Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was used as a liquid phase sintering additive which was expected to improve the sintering process and promote physiological bioresorbability. Compressive strength and four-point bending strength were measured by the Bionix 858 test system. At the beginning, the mechanical strength proportionally increased with addition of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O up to 5 wt.%, but thereafter decreased. The microstructure and crystalline identification were analyzed by the techniques of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The relationship between mechanical strength of the sintered bioceramics and Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O dopant is given in terms of the presence of NaCa(PO3)(3), grain growth and abnormal grain coalescence while dopant increased.","NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,TAINAN,TAIWAN","LIN, FH (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,CTR BIOMED ENGN,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.",,,,,,,20,9,9,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0254-0584,,,MATER CHEM PHYS,Mater.

Thirteen lipids were examined by means of interdigital electrodes with narrow gaps of 20-50 mu m, made by IC technology. The membrane lateral resistance in air, resisting electrical voltage, the influence of impurities on resistance and the resistance change in acetic acid vapour are presented for the first time. It is shown that the electrical resistivity for self-assembling lipids depends on their duration of being in an electric field and the content of the conductive impurities. The interdigital electrode is a transducer as well as a powerful tool for researching biomaterials and mimicking materials. The conducting mechanism of lipids is discussed.

The interaction of salmon calcitonin (sCT) and poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) was detected during preparation and evaluation of microspheres. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the extent and nature of the interaction. Methods. Blank microspheres were prepared by an aqueous emulsification solvent extraction technique. Adsorption studies were carried out at six concentrations of sCT and three concentrations of microspheres. Adsorption isotherms were constructed using the Langmuir and Freundlich treatments. Results. Adsorption at 1 mg/ml sCT concentration resulted in almost complete depletion of the peptide from the adsorption medium with the time to reach maximum adsorption decreasing with increasing microsphere concentration. At sCT concentrations below 100 mu g/ml, a true equilibrium occurred in 1 hour or less while at higher concentrations (up to 350 mu g/ml), a transient equilibrium was reached in 1 to 2 hours, followed by further adsorption of the peptide. The adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm at concentrations below 200 mu g/ml, indicating formation of a monolayer. Multilayer interaction, described by the Freundlich isotherm, occurred at higher concentrations and resulted in complete depletion of sCT from the adsorption medium. The affinity constant during monolayer formation was 0.09 and the plateau surface concentration was 5.1 mu g/mg. The multilayer peptide-peptide adsorption showed a lower affinity (0.025) but higher capacity (24 mu g/mg) than the monolayer peptide-polymer adsorption. Conclusions. The results show that poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres have a high adsorption capacity for sCT which must be considered in formulating a controlled delivery product of this peptide.","UNIV KENTUCKY, COLL PHARM, LEXINGTON, KY 40536 USA; ORAVAX INC, DEPT DENT RES, FT GEORGE G MEADE, MD 20755 USA; TAIPEI MED COLL, SCH PHARM, TAIPEI, TAIWAN",,,,,,,,21,54,54,0,5,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,1573-904X,,PHARM RES-DORDR,Pharm.

Participants.-A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member consensus panel representing the fields of orthopedic surgery, rehabilitation and physical medicine, biomechanics and biomaterials, internal medicine, public health, geriatrics, biostatistics, and a public representative. In addition, 27 experts in orthopedic surgery, rehabilitation and physical medicine, biomechanics and biomaterials, rheumatology, geriatrics, and epidemiology presented data to the consensus panel and a conference audience of 425. Evidence.-The literature was searched through MEDLINE and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel and the conference audience. Experts prepared abstracts with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. Consensus.-The panel, answering predefined consensus questions, developed their conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. Consensus Statement.-The panel composed a draft statement that was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. Conclusions.-Total hip replacement is an option for nearly all patients with diseases of the hip that cause chronic discomfort and significant functional impairment. Most patients have an excellent prognosis for long-term improvement in symptoms and physical function. At this time, a cemented femoral component using modern cementing techniques, paired with a porous-coated acetabular component, can give excellent long-term results. Revision of a total hip replacement is indicated when mechanical failure occurs. Continued periodic follow-up is necessary to identify early evidence of impending failure so as to permit remedial action before a catastrophic event.","UNIV MARYLAND,SCH MED,DEPT EPIDEMIOL & PREVENT MED,BALTIMORE,MD 21201; UNIV KANSAS,MED CTR,CTR AGING,KANSAS CITY,KS 66103; HOWARD UNIV,WASHINGTON,DC 20059; BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,DEPT INTERNAL MED,WINSTON SALEM,NC; YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED & REHABIL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT BIOMAT,BIRMINGHAM,AL; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT SURG,DIV ORTHOPAED SURG,BIRMINGHAM,AL; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,SCH HYG & PUBL HLTH,BALTIMORE,MD; UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,MED CTR,DEPT MED,DEPT MED RHEUMATOL,PRINCETON,NJ; KOLCZUN & KOLCZUN ORTHOPAED ASSOCIATES,LORAIN,OH","MURRAY, DG (reprint author), SUNY HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT ORTHOPED SURG,SYRACUSE,NY 13210, USA.",,"Dickersin, Kay/A-4576-2008","Duncan, Pamela/0000-0002-4838-3253; Jacobs, Joshua/0000-0003-3902-7334; Cauley, Jane A/0000-0003-0752-4408",,,,0,79,79,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610",0098-7484,,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This in vitro organogenesis technique was used since 1983 to treat burns and children suffering from severe cutaneous malformations (giant naevi). The results which were obtained after 33 grafts on 16 patients show that, if the epidermal graft is essential to preserve patients'lives the dermal constituent is also important in the long-term since it induces the synthesis, 3 to 6 months later, of numerous elastic fibers which give to the graft mechanical properties close to that of the normal skin as well as the recovery of a normal microrelief. These cutaneous reconstructions can be completed in one or, even better, two stages which enable the successive graft of reconstructed dermis and epidermal sheets, the latter obteined in great quantity thank's to Grenn's method.

Polyglycolic acid (PGA) and glycolide-trimethylene carbonate block copolymer fibers in the form of 2/0 size Dexon and Maxon sutures from Davis/Geck were used in this study. In addition, injection-molded PGA disks were also used for determining how different polymer morphology affected the outcomes of gamma irradiation and irradiation temperature. These two types of biomaterials were Co-60 gamma irradiated at two irradiation temperatures (55 and -78 degrees C in dry ice). Both gamma-irradiated and control specimens were immersed in a phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.44 at 37 degrees C for various durations of hydrolysis. After each predetermined duration, the specimens were removed for subsequent testing which included determinations of tensile strength, weight loss, level of crystallinity, melting temperature, intrinsic viscosity, surface morphology, and infrared spectroscopic characteristics. gamma irradiation at both irradiation temperature resulted in a faster hydrolytic degradation of these two biodegradable polymers. There was no apparent irradiation temperature effect in terms of mass loss, intrinsic viscosity, level of crystallinity, and melting temperature. However, irradiation temperature effect was evident in those properties that depended on the tie-chain segments located in the noncrystalline domains, such as tensile strength. The observed effect of irradiation temperature was attributed to chain mobility which could facilitate cage recombination of macromolecular radical pairs at the irradiation temperature lower than the glass transition temperature of the irradiated polymers.

Method: In Wistar rats the MNGC recruited after the implantation of hydroxyapatite (HA) particles in standardized skull defects were examined morphologically (at both the light and electron microscope levels), enzymatically (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase), and after a challenge with salmon calcitonin. Results: The MNGC were of great size and contained abundant mitochondria, vacuoles, and vesicles throughout the cytoplasm; they were either tightly apposed to the HA surface or had long and thin processes penetrating the material. When processed for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, only a few cells were weakly stained. The staining was totally suppressed when samples were pretreated with cyanuric chloride in the MNGC but not in the host osteoclasts. Calcitonin induced the withdrawal of the host osteoclasts from the bone surface while the MNGC remained in contact with the HA material. Conclusion: The MNGC recruited to HA particles did not exhibit the morphologic, enzymatic and functional characteristics of the osteoclasts, and consequently must be regarded as macrophage polykaryons.

Biomimetic approaches have been based on polymers endowed with bioadhesive receptor-binding peptides and mono- and oligosaccharides. These materials have been patterned in two- and three-dimensions to generate model multicellular tissue architectures, and this approach may be useful in future efforts to generate complex organizations of multiple cell types, Natural polymers have also played an important role in these efforts, and recombinant polymers that combine the beneficial aspects of natural polymers with many of the desirable features of synthetic polymers have been designed and produced. Biomaterials have been employed to conduct and accelerate otherwise naturally occurring phenomena, such as tissue regeneration in wound healing in the otherwise healthy subject; to induce cellular responses that might not be normally present, such as healing in a diseased subject or the generation of a new vascular bed to receive a subsequent cell transplant; and to block natural phenomena, such as the immune rejection of cell transplants from other species or the transmission of growth factor signals that stimulate scar formation.

Six-week in vitro exposure of 65:35 POE films to a cholesterol emulsion (1 g/L) showed no apparent difference in hydrolytic degradation rates of mechanical properties or mass loss compared to deionized water exposed films. Decreases of 28 and 6% in inherent viscosity were observed after 5 weeks for cholesterol and deionized water exposed films, respectively, suggesting cholesterol may have some effect, Further examination of the data, due to sample variation, revealed that clear, uniform films showed only minor changes in mass loss and mechanical properties after 6 weeks in either of the in vitro media, But slightly cloudy films possessing microscopic bubbles showed accelerated degradation in both media, indicating the effect of cholesterol was inconclusive due to sample variation, Central of the microbubble formation process could have utility in controlling hydrolytic degradation of POE films.

Recent studies have emphasized the endogenous source of these bacteria and have pointed to the upper gastrointestinal tract as a major source. Gastric bacterial overgrowth is known to be promoted by raised intragastric pH. Further evidence suggests that duodenal reflux is just as important in gastric bacterial overgrowth and subsequent colonization of the mechanically ventilated lung. Work on the biomaterials lining the inside of the tracheal tube in critically ill patients has shown that this biofilm can be scattered many centimetres as a result of ventilator gasflow. In vitro and in vivo evidence has been found to support a fluid dynamic process that results in dissemination of tracheal tube biofilm, which also contains neutrophils and their contents. The dissemination of combined bacteria, effete neutrophils and their breakdown products into already compromised lungs may explain the complexity of the clinical condition known as ventilator-associated pneumonia. It may thus be more correct to refer to the condition as 'ventilator-induced pnuemonitis'.",,"INGLIS, TJJ (reprint author), NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, FAC MED, DEPT MICROBIOL, LOWER KENT RIDGE RD, SINGAPORE 0511, SINGAPORE.",,,,,,,11,17,18,0,0,W B SAUNDERS CO LTD,LONDON,"32 JAMESTOWN RD, LONDON NW1 7BY, ENGLAND",0195-6701,1532-2939,,J HOSP INFECT,J.

The denaturation temperature, T-m, of rbSt and lysozyme decreased with increasing moisture irrespective of the excipient. However, the magnitude of the decrease elicited by moisture was dependent on the type of excipient. Furthermore, the effect of the excipient was dependent on the moisture content; excipients decreased T-m in low moisture solids (i.e., < 5% moisture) and increased it in hydrated solids (i.e., > 15% moisture). In the dry state < 1% moisture), the addition of 50% sucrose, sorbitol, or glycerol lowered the T-m of rbSt from 161 degrees C to 136, 120, and 83 degrees C, respectively, indicating a destabilizing mechanism. Likewise, the T-m of lysozyme decreased from 156 degrees C to 142, 128, and 97 degrees C due to the addition of sucrose, sorbitol, and glycerol, respectively. At higher moisture contents, the excipients promoted a higher transition temperature at a given moisture content than the pure protein systems, indicating a stabilizing mechanism. An increase in the enthalpy of unfolding for dehydrated lysozyme was noted with increasing levels of moisture and/or excipient, despite the observed decrease in T-m. The thermal stability, or T-m, of the dehydrated proteins appeared to be correlated to the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the excipient, which in turn should be related to the T-g of the system. The lower the T-g of the excipient, the greater was the degree of destabilization. This result suggests different modes of conformational stabilization by excipients may exist for proteins in the solid state depending on the moisture content.","UPJOHN CO,DRUG DELIVERY RES & DEV,KALAMAZOO,MI 49007",,,,,,,,43,82,84,0,14,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on polytetrafluoroethylene also deposited more plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 into the extracellular matrix than did control cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene, Our results give evidence that human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on two biomaterials used to construct vascular grafts, namely polytetrafluoroethylene and polyurethane, produce tissue-type plasminogen activator as well as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, two major components of the fibrinolytic system also expressed by endothelial cells in vivo.

Several reagents were tested for their ability to disrupt rhapidosomes isolated from Aquaspirillum itersonii into their component proteins. Only treatments with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride were found to disrupt rhapidosomes. A protocol was developed to renature the disrupted component proteins using rapid dilution and subsequent dialysis of the residual guanidinium hydrochloride. The renatured proteins were shown to have secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism. Furthermore, upon renaturation the two component proteins interacted with each other to form a complex of molecular mass > 2500 kDa.

The enabling concept is straightforward: cells or small clusters of tissue are surrounded by a selective membrane barrier which admits oxygen and required metabolites, releases bioactive cell secretions but restricts the transport of the larger cytotoxic agents of the body's immune defense system. Use of a selective membrane both eliminates the need for chronic immunosuppression in the host and allows cells to be obtained from non-human sources, thus avoiding the cell-sourcing constraints which have limited the clinical application of general successful investigative trials of unencapsulated cell transplantation for chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, and type I diabetes. Target applications for encapsulated cell therapy include these same disorders as well as other disabilities caused by loss of secretory cell function which cannot be adequately treated by current organ transplantation or drug therapies and conditions potentially capable of responding to local sustained delivery of growth factors and other biologic response modifiers. Several types of device configurations are possible. Here we focus on easily retrieved, non-vascularized, macrocapsules. Such devices have four basic components: a hollow fiber or flat sheet membrane (usually thermoplastic based), cells (primary or dividing), and extracellular matrix (natural or synthetic) to promote cell viability and function, and other device components such as seals, tethers and radio-opaque markers. Choice of membrane and extracellular matrix polymers as well as issues surrounding implantation and biocompatibility evaluation are complex, inter-related, and ultimately driven by implantation site and delivery requirements.

This regulation is generally mediated by cell receptor/ligand interactions providing primary targets for molecular intervention. While regulatory ligands may often be exogenous in nature, in the categories of endocrine and paracrine hormone systems, they are being increasingly appreciated as crucial in local control of cell and tissue function. Improvements in design of health care technologies involving autocrine ligand interactions with cell receptors should benefit from increased qualitative and quantitative understanding of the kinetic and transport processes governing these interactions. In this symposium paper we offer a concise overview of our recent efforts combining molecular cell biology and engineering approaches to increase the understanding of how molecular and cellular parameters may be manipulated for improved control of cell and tissue function regulated by autocrine ligands.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CELL & STRUCT BIOL,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV UTAH,DEPT PATHOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT",,,,"Wiley, Steven/0000-0003-0232-6867",,,,57,12,12,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL INC CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0090-6964,,,ANN BIOMED ENG,Ann.

To achieve such a goal, two approaches have been successfully applied: existing cellulosic polymers were modified, either by introducing functional groups through ester or ether bonds, by mixing synthetic polymers with bulk additives, or by using copolymerization techniques. As a detailed example, the first synthetically modified cellulose membrane, Hemophan, was prepared by substituting some hydrogen atoms in the cellulosic glucose unit by diethyl-amino-ethyl groups with the modification having a considerable impact on the membrane's hemocompatibility. It is further known that the hemocompatibility of hydrophobic synthetic membranes is improved by rendering these materials partially hydrophilic. We tested the hypothesis, whether the hemocompatibility of a material, which is hydrophilic per se, such as unmodified cellulose, is changed after the introduction of hydrophobic substituents. For this purpose, the number and nature of substituents have been systematically varied in order to alter surface properties, and these variations have been subsequently related to blood compatibility parameters. As expected, thrombin generation as well as complement- and cell-activation depend on the number and nature of the substituents whereby some of the substituents show a very narrow optimum if their hemocompatibility is related to the degree of substitution. Changes in hemocompatibility can be followed by physical methods, such as surface angle analyses and zeta potential determinations. Data show that alterations in the lipophilic/hydrophilic balance on the polymer surface may explain substituent-related changes in polymer hemocompatibility. Molecular modeling of membrane surface and protein structures may be of further help in understanding possible interactions. The recent conclusion is that polymer modification and techniques in membrane surface characterization help us to optimize membrane fabrication for specific applications.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,GEESTHACHT,GERMANY","VIENKEN, J (reprint author), AKZO NOBEL FASER AG,POSTFACH 200151,D-42289 WUPPERTAL,GERMANY.",,,,,,,38,46,46,1,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL INC CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc., to withdraw its polymers for use in implantable devices has presented the medical device industry with an immediate and serious challenge to find alternative sources of biomaterials. In France, the company Cardial S.A. has already taken steps to find an alternative polyester yarn to replace Dacron(R) by developing a new arterial prosthesis knitted from polyester yarns supplied by Rhone-Poulenc Fibres. This article describes an in vitro and in vivo study of this French device, called the Dialine(R) prosthesis, with a view to determining its relative performance compared to current American and British prostheses, which rely on DuPont's Dacron(R) yarn. In addition to analyses of the morphology and textile structure, and measurements of its physical and chemical properties, the Dialine(R) graft was implanted as a thoracoabdominal bypass in dogs for periods ranging from 4 h to 6 months. In addition to our pathologic and histologic observations, we cleaned and evaluated the explanted prostheses for in vivo changes in dimensions, strength, and crystalline microstructure. The Dialine(R) graft was found to differ structurally from other polyester prostheses because it is warp-knitted from a mixture of flat and texturized yarns with finer filaments. Its denser structure has a lower water permeability, greater flexibility and ease of handling, satisfactory strength, and dimensional stability, and it presents different textures on its luminal and external surfaces. The in vivo trial demonstrated that it has excellent biocompatibility and biostability over 6 months. With no thrombi observed on the luminal surface after 3 months, it has a faster rate of healing, generates compact external and internal capsules with a thinner neointima, and has an overall milder inflammatory response than is normally observed with Dacron(R)-based prostheses.

This morbidity of Cpa is primarily do to activation of blood proteins and cells by contact with nonendothelial cell surfaces of the wound and biomaterials of the extracorporeal perfusion circuit. CPB is not possible without heparin, yet heparin is not an ideal anticoagulant and does not prevent activation of at least five plasma protein systems and five blood cells. Stimulation of these blood elements produces over 25 vasoactive substances that alter vascular tone, capillary permeability, and cardiac myocyte contractility. In addition, CPB produces showers of microemboli that pass filters to obstruct arterioles and precapillaries to produce necrosis of widely dispersed, small groups of cells. Attempts to develop nonthrombogenic synthetic materials have failed; only the endothelial cell is nonthrombogenic and achieves this property by active metabolic processes. Although some biomaterials are less thrombogenic than others, all activate blood elements to initiate clotting and the body's defense reaction. The concept of ''blood anesthesia'' envisions the use of reversible inhibitors of key blood reactions to temporarily prevent activation of blood elements during Cpa. If the initial reactions of blood with nonendothelial surfaces are blocked, production of many vasoactive substances and microemboli by CPB is suppressed. This conserves blood elements that are normally consumed during CPB and makes them available after the inhibitor is reversed. Effective, reversible inhibitors of platelets are entering clinical trials; reversible inhibitors of other key blood relations ave being developed and tested at a rapid rate. Within the next decade ''blood anesthesia'' for Cpa promises to substantially reduce the morbidity associated with open heat surgery.","UNIV PENN,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 47186],,,0,8,8,0,0,FUTURA PUBL CO,ARMONK,"135 BEDFORD RD, PO BOX 418, ARMONK, NY 10504-0418",0886-0440,,,J CARDIAC SURG,J.

Three types of DSCs were commercially obtained: non-crosslinked DSC (NDSC), and DSC crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GDSC) and hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDSC). NDSC, HDSC and GDSC were (enzymatically) tissue culture pretreated to eliminate their cytotoxic products. Beside this, crosslinking methods were modified to optimize mechanical properties and to decrease cytotoxicity, which resulted in HDSC* and GDSC*. Furthermore, DSC was crosslinked by activation of the carboxylic groups, i.e. by means of acyl azide and carbodiimide, resulting in AaDSC and CDSC, respectively. After implantation of HDSCs and GDSCs a relation between cytotoxicity and calcification of crosslinked DSC could be made. No relation was found between cellular infiltration of DSCs and calcification. However, from the use of different types and modification of crosslinking methods it might be concluded that calcification is mainly related to stable crosslinks, i.e. to the chemical properties of the obtained material.","UNIV TWENTE, DEPT CHEM TECHNOL, 7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT CELL BIOL & ELECTRONMICROSCOPY, OOSTERSINGEL 69-2, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.",,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,40,38,38,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Methods: Foreign-body infection in the biliary tract was investigated in rats. Rubber drain pieces were implanted in the biliary tract in rats for 1-4 weeks, followed by challenges with 10(2) to 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu) Escherichia coli injected into the common bile duct. The rate of infection was calculated, the bacterial growth in the biliary tract was observed over 72 h after challenges, and the opsonic activity in bile and in sera was assessed. Results: In the group with drain material, inocula as small as 10(2) cfu produced persisting infection in the common bile duct in 90% of animals, whereas the same number of E. coli infected only 30% of rats in the control and sham implantation groups (p < 0.01, chi-square test). Complement-mediated opsonic activity in bile of animals with implanted drain pieces gradually decreased with time, whereas opsonic activity in sera from the same animals remained unchanged. Conclusions: Implants in the biliary tract impair local host defense, resulting in an increased susceptibility to microbial infection.","UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT SURG,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN; UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,"Bengmark, Stig/0000-0003-1809-8889",,,,36,5,5,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0036-5521,,,SCAND J GASTROENTERO,Scand.

However, surprisingly little is known of the factors that determine biocompatibility of the materials used in these devices. These materials, although generally inert and non-toxic, can mediate a variety of adverse reactions, including inflammation, fibrosis, coagulation, and infection. This brief review focuses on the inflammatory responses (including fibrosis) that commonly occur around implanted biomaterials. Host proteins that spontaneously associate with implant surfaces are important determinants of the acute inflammatory response. In this regard, adsorbed fibrinogen appears particularly pro-inflammatory. Chronic inflammatory processes, in many cases in response to fragments of implanted biomaterials, may cause implant failure. In the case of silicone-filled mammary prostheses, the extravasation of silicone gel has been held responsible for a number of complications, including silicone granuloma, synovitis, connective-tissue disease, and lymphadenopathy. In some instances, material-mediated inflammatory responses may even cause degradation of the material itself (via oxidative products released by implant-associated inflammatory cells). Overall, there is insufficient knowledge of the determinants and mechanisms of host: implant responses. A clear understanding of tissue:biomaterial interactions will be required both to explain the pathogenesis of many implant-mediated complications and to aid in the development of more biocompatible materials for implantable devices.","ALBANY MED COLL,DEPT PATHOL & LAB MED,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,ALBANY,NY 12208",,,,,,,,100,300,306,4,87,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0002-9173,,,AM J CLIN PATHOL,Am.

Pathologic findings in different organs show that it can accumulate in brain, muscle, liver and bone. Therefore, we investigated whether patients with cementless total hip endoprostheses made out of titanium alloys containing aluminum are at risk. In order to determine the complete aluminum body loading in patients who have had their hip replacement for a long period of time (mean 58 months), we mobilized possible stores of aluminum with desferoxamine (DFO). Electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to quantify the level of aluminum in serum and urine before and after DFO treatment. A serum aluminum value of 10 mu g/l or less is internationally accepted as safe. The average serum aluminum level in this study was 14.2 mu g/l, which is slightly above the limit, but clearly below those levels which can lead to disease (> 50 mu g/l). No relevant storage of aluminum was found. This latter finding is more important since chronically elevated aluminum levels lead to cellular deposits, which affect the cellular biochemistry. The values before and after DFO mobilization did not differ substantially, indicating that aluminum in alloys for biomaterials can be regarded as safe as far as the risk of aluminum release in vivo is concerned. Histologic studies of bone from the bone-metal interface also showed no deposits of local aluminum release.","DIALYSEZENTRUM,BOVENDEN,GERMANY; UNIV GOTTINGEN,ORTHOPAD KLIN,GOTTINGEN,GERMANY","DITTERT, DD (reprint author), UNIV KLIN GOTTINGEN,PATHOL ABT 1,ROBERT KOCH STR 40,D-37075 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,17,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0936-8051,,,ARCH ORTHOP TRAUM SU,Arch.

Four types of copolymer polystyrene (PS) microspheres were synthesized by variation of four possible monomer ratios that included styrene, methoxy-PEO-methacrylate (750 and 2000 mol. wt PEO) and allylurea. This produced poly(styrene-(methoxy-PEO)methacrylate) microspheres with hydrophilic side-groups of either urea (PS-U-PEO) and/or mixed molecular weight (750/2000 mol. wt) PEO (PS-U-M-PEO, PS-M-PEO), or single molecular weight (2000) PEO (PS-PEO) at their surfaces. The hypothesis was tested that increasing the total content of PEO comprising the steric barrier reduces attachment to cell surfaces. Attachment of PEO microspheres bearing the urea spacer and/or mixed molecular weight PEO was found to be intermediate between charge stabilized control PS and PEO (2000 mol. wt) bearing particles. Post-adsorption of different Poloxamer (PEO-poly(propylene oxide)-PEO) surfactants to the microspheres further decreased attachment. Significant negative linear correlations between surface PEO content, measured by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), and attachment to Kupffer cells were demonstrated. Decreases in attachment also resulted with all graft PEO particles bearing adsorbed sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), whilst the attachment of SDS-treated PS control particles increased. It is proposed that trains of adsorbed graft PEO are displaced by the SDS to increase the effective fraction of graft PEO within the steric layer. Overall, increasing the amount of hydrophilic PEO in the steric layer, from graft and adsorbed sources, reduces the attachment of these particles to Kupffer cells in vitro.","UNIV NOTTINGHAM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,NOTTINGHAM NG2 7RD,ENGLAND; ICI AGROCHEM,BRACKNELL RG12 GEY,BERKS,ENGLAND; ICI PHARMACEUT PLC,MACCLESFIELD SK10 4TG,CHESHIRE,ENGLAND; ICI PAINTS,SLOUGH SL2 5DS,BERKS,ENGLAND; UNIV SURREY,DEPT MAT SCI,GUILDFORD GU2 5KH,SURREY,ENGLAND",,,,"Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596; Harper, Garry/0000-0001-9646-0850",,,,39,24,24,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,APR,1995.0,16,6,,,,,427,439,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)98815-V,,,,13,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QT559,WOS:A1995QT55900001,7654869.0,,,,2019-02-25

Second, both in vitro and in vivo there appears to be less cellular adhesion and activation on the surface of CVD diamond surfaces compared to Ti and SS.

In conclusion, activated U937 cells are good candidates to use in a normative in vitro method to evaluate new biomaterials.","FAC CHIRURG DENT,RECH MAT INTERET BIOL LAB,CNRS,EP 59,INSERM,CJF 9305,F-44042 NANTES,FRANCE; CHU NANTES,INSERM,U211,NANTES,FRANCE; ST GEORGE HOSP,SCH MED,DEPT CELLULAR & MOLEC SCI,LONDON SW17 0RE,ENGLAND",,,"BLOTTIERE, Herve/C-6120-2011; Anegon, Ignacio/I-7498-2018; Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","BLOTTIERE, Herve/0000-0002-8390-0607; Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,33,24,24,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,APR,1995.0,16,6,,,,,497,503,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)98824-X,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QT559,WOS:A1995QT55900010,7544631.0,,,,2019-02-25

A concomitant dose-dependent production of both IL-1 beta and IL-2 in response to PMMA stimulation was detected.

We propose that biocompatibility of contemporary medical implants is not a property of the chemical composition of the biomaterials but depends rather on their physical attributes. The histological reaction patterns of tissue to the presence of polyethylene in diverse physical states are described. The inflammatory response evoked by the implants is laudable in so far as it precedes and accompanies the adequate tissular incorporation of the devices used. On the other hand, the granulomatous reaction induced by small, irregularly shaped and edgy breakdown products adversely affects the life span of the implants. Thus the manner in which the host handles the biomaterials is determined primarily by the physical state of the biomaterials (rather than their chemical composition), which in turn determines the success or failure of reconstructive surgery. It logically follows that biocompatibility constitutes a relativistic concept.","BNAI ZION MED CTR,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,IL-31048 HAIFA,ISRAEL; TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,RAPPAPORT FAC MED,CTR IMPLANT SURG,HAIFA,ISRAEL","BOSS, JH (reprint author), BNAI ZION MED CTR,DEPT PATHOL,POB 4940,IL-31048 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,39,10,11,1,3,ISRAEL JOURNAL MED SCIENCES,JERUSALEM,"2 ETZEL ST, FRENCH HILL, JERUSALEM 97853, ISRAEL",0021-2180,,,ISRAEL J MED SCI,Isr.

Six materials were investigated: biomedical reference polyethylene and polydimethylsiloxane; argon plasma-treated reference polyethylene (Ar-PE); Silastic(R); expanded polytetrafluoroethylene; and woven Dacron. All of the polymers except Dacron demonstrated reduced bacterial adhesion with increasing shear stress. Argon plasma treatment of polyethylene reduced the level of staphylococcal adhesion. Adsorption of human plasma proteins effected significantly lower numbers of adherent bacteria. The lowest adhesion was observed for Ar-PE in 1% human plasma protein solution, whereas Dacron had the highest number of adherent bacteria. The high adhesion on Dacron was attributed to increased bacterial flux caused by topography-induced turbulent flow and physical entrapment of the bacteria in the fiber interstices. The results indicate that the driving force for S. epidermidis adhesion is strongly influenced by substrate physicochemistry, but this may be dominated by physical forces such as shear and turbulence.

The heat production per cell was calculated. A rapid increase of metabolic activity followed by a gradual decrease was demonstrated with both granulocyte suspension and platelet concentrate. Significant differences were obtained between the materials with a maximum response of Dacron grafts with collagen impregnation for both granulocyte and platelet response. The materials had different surface morphologies regarding cell adhesion after incubation as demonstrated with scanning electron microscopy with more pronounced adhesion on the collagen-impregnated grafts.

The aim was to study the soft tissue reactions at the implant site and further to correlate it to the clinical symptoms of the patients. At retrieval the plates were covered by a connective tissue layer of 2 mm thickness on average. In patients with local pain a comparatively significant higher number of round cells (p=0.001) and macrophages (p=0.01) was found. This is consistent with a chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction.

The interlayer distances of the complexes of the aliphatic amine with the nucleic acids were found to be by 7-8 Angstrom greater than those of the aliphatic amines without nucleic acids. IR spectra of the LB films at various relative humidities reveal that the multilayer complex formation is provided by the interaction between PO2- and C=O groups of nucleic acids and NH3+ -groups of aliphatic amines.

The CST's were low, particularly that of the polymer with pentadecafluorooctyl side chains, which was among the lowest measured for polymers. This latter polymer also retained high contact angles after 2 weeks of exposure to water.

How can we predict the long term security and efficacy of such an implant ? Only an interdisciplinary approach can provide a satisfactory answer. The surgeon must define the needs, he must find the appropriate surgical techniques and conduct the clinical trial. The material scientist must elaborate safe and secure materials with regards to their biotolerance and mechanical resistance. This has to be performed in close connection with the biomechanics lab. Biomechanic Science must predict the expected stresses. It has to design special simulator to quantify in vitro material toughness, wear characteristics, lubrication, behaviour and surface deformation. Biological and mechanical standardized tests have to be carried on. Then it is possible to conduct a clinical trial, prospectively in comparison to another already developed material. Clinical studies could serve to measure efficacy and radiological modification. After failure, it is possible to analyse retrieved specimen, to measure the material degradation in real environment, to perform biological studies on retrieved tissues ie : macrophagic activities, tissue response, bone ingrowth, inflammatory or immulogical reaction. For more than twenty years we worked on alumina against alumina total hips. The idea was to develop a low debris system to enhance long term longevity of the prosthesis. The Charnley design has proven its effectiveness for more than fifteen years, but polyethylene wear is responsible for late failures. This is specially crucial for young patients, male sex and high activity level patients. At the beginning, biological studies and mechanical tests were performed, it appeared that the biological tolerance of alumina ceramic was excellent, the fracture thoughness was adequate, but there were some problems related to alumina fixation in the body and also alumina head fixation on metallic stem. Alumina material improved with time. It was possible to diminish the fracture risks and to increase the safety. Parallel information from the first period was used to increase the material quality, the surgical techniques and also to define indication in the use of such material. It is now clear and it also has been published that alumina against alumina system has proved to be as safe as Charnley total hips. It has been proved to give better results in the young age population. Then it is now possible to operate on very young patients, to allow these patients to perform heavy work, sports and regular daily activity for their demand. In conclusion, long terme evaluation of orthopaedic implants has to be carried on with very scientific bases. Prospective tests must mimic a in-living system, but the clinical trial is the only way to really get the answer for the very long term.",,"SEDEL, L (reprint author), HOP ST LOUIS,SERV CHIRURG ORTHOPED & TRAUMATOL,1 AVE CLAUDE VELLEFAUX,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,5,ACADEMIE NATL DE MEDECINE,PARIS 06,"16 RUE BONAPARTE, 75272 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0001-4079,,,B ACAD NAT MED PARIS,Bull.

Every of them is responsible for a local and general reaction : foreign body reaction, coagulation, whole body inflammatory response. For years, these reactions have been poorly understood and development was of a very empirical nature.

It took 10 years for intraocular lenses to take off, due to the necessary improvement of both surgery and manufacturing, since then all the intraocular lenses are made of the same material and perfectly tolerated. However the material is hard and not foldable. The improvement of Phakoemulsification have made small incision (3,2 mm) surgery possible, however there is a need for new foldable implants that can be inserted into the eye through a small incision, so rather new bio material are now being used. A variety of silicone foldable lenses have been proposed, their advantages are : easy foldability, solidity and injectability through an injector. Their disadvantages are, as compared to the 40 years standing solid PMMA lenses; less biocompatibility changes in color and apparition of crystal precipitates. Also reports on induced polyarthritis, lupus and paraneoplasic syndroms with other silicone prosthesis, these complications appear after 5 or 6 years. Although new silicone lenses are being brought on the market, there is some hesitation in implanting these lenses on patients less than 80 years of age. Polyhema lenses appeared in 1985, with 38 % water content. The material is perfectly biocompatible even more than PMMA, however their initial design mi was not adequate until 1992. Their advantages are perfect biocompatibility over the years, autoclavability. Their only disadvantage a certain fragility during folding. Our 7 years experience with silicone and hydrogel has shown that 20 % of the first silicone lenses had to be exchanged between 3 to 4 years after surgery and 0 % of the polyhema. Posterior capsule opacification at 1 year was twice more frequent with silicone thant with PMMA or hydrogels and that mild chronic uveitis occurs 3 times frequently with silicone lenses.",,,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,8,ACADEMIE NATL DE MEDECINE,PARIS 06,"16 RUE BONAPARTE, 75272 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0001-4079,,,B ACAD NAT MED PARIS,Bull.

Many metals have been experimented. The best biocompatibility was obtained with pure or mixed titan. Various elements are conditioning the OI : the surface condition of the implant, the coating through hydroxylapatite, the morphology, the length, the diameter. Among surgical factors damaging the OI, the main responsability comes from thermic raising during the drilling of tissu bone cavity. The procedure consists of 2 stages : Ist stage : drilling the cavity and setting the implant under the gum; 2nd stage : after 6 months, uncovering the implant. In implantology, biomaterials have other uses : filling materials of natural or artificially created tissu bone cavities. Main biomaterials used are autogenic bone, substitutes of heterologous tissu bones, coral, hydroxylapatite or tricalcic phosphatic ceramics. Rebuilding of osseous ridges can be well improved by using barriers.","HOP PARIS,COLL MED,PARIS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,ACADEMIE NATL DE MEDECINE,PARIS 06,"16 RUE BONAPARTE, 75272 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0001-4079,,,B ACAD NAT MED PARIS,Bull.

Proliferation of fibroblasts and osteoblasts was measured using incorporation of tritiated thymidine into total DNA. Attachment of cells was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent labelling of vinculin, a component of the cell's focal adhesion plaque. The degree of cell attachment was quantified on the materials by determining the mean number of adhesion plaques and using an image analysis system to determine the mean total area of plaques per cell. Fibroblasts and osteoblasts responded differently to the materials tested. When grown on PES surfaces, rat tail fibroblasts synthesized significantly greater amounts of DNA than cells on all other surfaces, whilst fibroblasts on UHMWPE synthesized significantly less DNA than cells on all other materials. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the amounts of DNA synthesized by osteoblasts grown on the various materials. Determination of the number of vinculin adhesion plaques per cell and the mean total area of the plaques per cell showed that the attachment of fibroblasts to UHMWPE was significantly reduced compared with other materials. In contrast there was no significant difference in the adhesion of osteoblasts to different materials. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of cells on the materials correlated with the morphometric data. Cells with the greatest number and area of adhesion plaques were well spread and flattened whilst those with the least number of adhesion plaques were more rounded and less spread.","UNIV COLL & MIDDLESEX SCH MED,INST ORTHOPAED,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND; UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,DEPT ANAT,CARDIFF CF1 3YF,S GLAM,WALES",,,,,,,,16,196,199,2,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAR,1995.0,16,4,,,,,287,295,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)93256-D,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QM942,WOS:A1995QM94200004,7772668.0,,,,2019-02-25

In this study, microporous polyurethane arterial prostheses implanted as a canine thoraco-abdominal bypass were explanted after 1 and 12 months and were cleaned without fixation using four different digesting enzyme treatments, including collagenase, pancreatin and trypsin alone and collagenase and pancreatin in series, followed by washing in a solution of Triton X-100 detergent. By following this approach all the fresh tissue attached to the external and internal wails of the prostheses was removed with minimal damage to the underlying synthetic polymer. The morphology of the explanted and cleaned polyurethane prostheses could be obtained readily by light and scanning electron microscopy. Surface microporous features and the presence of polyurethane microfibres that had experienced in vivo biodegradation could therefore be identified easily. The surface and bulk physicochemical properties of the polyurethane polymer were determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the most successful approach for removing fresh tissue and exposing a clean and uncontaminated polyurethane surface was to incubate the explanted samples first in collagenase followed by digestion in pancreatin. This particular cleaning technique has proved valuable in enabling us to monitor small in vivo changes in the surface chemistry and in the bulk microphase segmented structure of polyurethane biomaterials.","UNIV LAVAL,DEPT SURG,QUEBEC CITY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; ST FRANCIS ASSISI HOSP,QUEBEC BIOMAT INST,QUEBEC CITY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA",,,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,15,20,20,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAR,1995.0,16,5,,,,,369,380,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)93854-7,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QM978,WOS:A1995QM97800004,7662822.0,,,,2019-02-25

In an attempt to supply a bank of gingiva explants, frozen and freshly excised specimens were cultured in parallel. Optical and scanning electron microscopy showed an early release of cuboidal cells forming a dense layer around the explants. Afterwards, cultures evolved differently. Spread cells grew and migrated more rapidly in fresh than in frozen explant cultures but their adhesion to substratum increased earlier in frozen ones. Epithelial phenotype of cells had been immunologically characterized by using a battery of monoclonal antibodies to cytokeratins (CKs). We found a time increasing expression of CKs 5, 6, 13, 14/15, 16 and 17, whereas amounts of CKs 1, 2, 10 and 11, specific for terminal differentiation, remained constant. The freezing procedure decreased the yield of CKs but did not modify the electrophoretic pattern. These results suggested that the differentiation of epithelial cells might proceed as in vivo. As an application, the cytocompatibility of precious (Au, Pd, Ag) and non-precious (Ni-Cr) alloys was assessed, the reference metals being Ti, which was chosen for its cytocompatibility and Cu, which was chosen for its cytotoxicity. Alloys differed by their ability to modulate cell proliferation and migration. Pd and Au exhibited a high migration potential, whereas Au-Pd and Ti allowed efficient cell proliferation but restricted migration. Reduced migration and proliferation attested the low cytocompatibility of Ag. The toxicity of Cu and Ni-Cr prevented cell migration. These results showed the availability of this method for selecting biomaterials.","UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELLULAIRE EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,9,9,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,MAR,1995.0,5,1,,,,,1,14,,,,,,14,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,RN485,WOS:A1995RN48500001,,,,,2019-02-25

The present study assessed whether this was also true for metal implants commonly used in orthopaedics and oral medicine. Bone-bonding titanium (Ti) or nonbonding stainless steel (SS) implants were placed in the right tibias of Sabra rats following ablation of the marrow. At 3, 6, 14, and 21 days postinjury, newly formed endosteal bone in the treated and contralateral limbs was removed and matrix vesicle-enriched membranes isolated. Alkaline phosphatase and phospholipase A(2) specific activities and phosphatidylserine (PS) content were determined and compared with those of a nonsurgical control group. Results show that matrix vesicle alkaline phosphatase and phospholipase A(2) activity and PS content was increased in the Ti-implanted limbs at 6 (peak), 14, and 21 days, although at levels less than observed in normal healing. Alkaline phosphatase activity remained elevated throughout the healing period, In contrast, these parameters were markedly inhibited in the SS-implanted limbs with respect to Ti or to normal healing. Both implants altered the systemic response associated with marrow ablation, but in an implant-specific manner. The results support the hypothesis that cells adjacent to bone-bonding materials can compensate for negative effects on primary mineralization during osteogenesis, whereas cells adjacent to nonbonding materials either do not compensate or are further depressed. The data support the use of the rat marrow ablation model as a tool for rapid, initial assessment of biomaterials in bone.","UNIV TEXAS,HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT ORTHOPAED,SAN ANTONIO,TX 78284",,,,"Dean, David/0000-0002-4512-9065","NIDCR NIH HHS [DE-05937, DE-08603]",,,0,22,22,0,2,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0905-7161,,,CLIN ORAL IMPLAN RES,Clin.

J,"MECHOLSKY, JJ",,,,"MECHOLSKY, JJ",,,FRACTURE-MECHANICS PRINCIPLES,DENTAL MATERIALS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TOUGHNESS,"The principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) were developed in the 1950s by George Irwin (1957). This work was based on previous investigations of Griffith (1920) and Orowan (1944). Irwin (1957) demonstrated that a crack shape in a particular location with respect to the loading geometry had a stress intensity associated with it. He also demonstrated the equivalence between the stress intensity concept and the familiar Griffith criterion of failure. More importantly, he described the systematic and controlled evaluation of the toughness of a material. Toughness is defined as the resistance of a material to rapid crack propagation and can be characterized by one parameter, K-IC. In contrast, the strength of a material is dependent on the size of the initiating crack present in that particular sample or component. The fracture toughness of a material is generally independent of the size of the initiating crack. The strength of any product is limited by the size of the cracks or defects during processing, production and handling. Thus, the application of fracture mechanics principles to dental biomaterials is invaluable in new material development, production control and failure analysis. This paper describes the most useful equations of fracture mechanics to be used in the failure analysis of dental biomaterials.",,"MECHOLSKY, JJ (reprint author), UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611, USA.",,,,,,,20,69,70,1,13,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

The effectiveness of a presently used Clemson bioengineering cleaning (CBC) protocol was evaluated for cleaning three different biomaterials (titanium, aluminum oxide, and polyethylene terephthalate, PET) contaminated with three different contaminants (calcium chloride, zinc chloride, and hexadecane). Radiolabeled tracer analysis (RTA), with the use of liquid scintillation, was used as the surface analytical technique to quantitatively determine the percent contaminant removed from the biomaterial surface. On average, the ultrasonic cleaning step removed 99.96% of all three contaminants from both titanium and aluminum oxide. The CBC protocol did not sufficiently clean PET fabric contaminated with hexadecane leaving 11.76% of the contaminant after the ultrasonic step. With the use of isopropyl alcohol in series with 1% Liquinox, the ultrasonic step cleaned the fabric soiled with hexadecane within 30 min, removing 99.85% of the hexadecane initially on the surface. RTA proved to be an excellent method of quantifying surface contamination on implant materials, and for assessing the effectiveness of cleaning protocols in question.

We identified the plasma proteins adsorbed onto four polymeric fibers used for synthetic ligament replacement: polyarylamide, polylactic acid, polyester, and polypropylene. The adsorbed proteins were eluted and analyzed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fibrinogen, albumin, IgG, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), and lipoproteins ApoA-1 and ApoE were the major proteins adsorbed onto polyarylamide. The three others biomaterials bound albumin, fibrinogen, ApoA-1, and ApoE;however, the proportions of proteins bound to each polymer differed. There was an inverse relationship between ApoA-1 and fibrinogen binding for all four biomaterials; polyarylamide bound a high percentage of fibrinogen, but little ApoA-1; polylactic acid, polyester, and polypropylene bound a high percentage of ApoA-1, but little fibrinogen. These results support suggestions that low fibrinogen adsorption might be due to the preferential adsorption of Apo-1. High fibrinogen binding to polyarylamide ligaments may favor fibroblast adherence, growth, and tissue repair.

Human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) were cultured on titanium (Ti) disks that had been prepared by one of five different treatment regimens. All disks were pretreated with hydrofluoric acid-nitric acid and washed (PT). PT disks were also: washed, and then electropolished (EP); fine sandblasted, etched with HCl and H2SO4, and washed (FA); coarse sandblasted, etched with HCl and H2SO4, and washed (CA); or Ti plasma-sprayed (TPS). Standard tissue culture plastic was used as a control. Surface topography and profile were evaluated by brightfield and darkfield microscopy, cold field emission scanning electron microscopy, and laser confocal microscopy, while chemical composition was mapped using energy dispersion X-ray analysis and elemental distribution determined using Auger electron spectroscopy. The effect of surface roughness on the cells was evaluated by measuring cell number, [H-3]thymidine incorporation into DNA, alkaline phosphatase specific activity, [H-3]uridine incorporation into RNA, [H-3]proline incorporation into collagenase digestible protein (CDP) and noncollagenase-digestible protein (NCP), and [S-35]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan. Based on surface analysis, the five different Ti surfaces were ranked in order of smoothest to roughest: EP, PT, FA, CA, and TPS. A TiO2 layer was found on all surfaces that ranged in thickness from 100 Angstrom in the smoothest group to 300 Angstrom in the roughest. When compared to confluent cultures of cells on plastic, the number of cells was reduced on the TPS surfaces and increased on the EP surfaces, while the number of cells on the other surfaces was equivalent to plastic. [H-3]Thymidine incorporation was inversely related to surface roughness. Alkaline phosphatase specific activity in isolated cells was found to decrease with increasing surface roughness, except for those cells cultured on CA. In contrast, enzyme activity in the cell layer was only decreased in cultures grown on FA- and TPS-treated surfaces. A direct correlation between surface roughness and RNA and CDP production was found. Surface roughness had no apparent effect on NCP production. Proteoglycan synthesis by the cells was inhibited on all the surfaces studied, with the largest inhibition observed in the CA and EP groups. These results demonstrate that surface roughness alters osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production in vitro. The results also suggest that implant surface roughness may play a role in determining phenotypic expression of cells in vivo.

The experiment was carried out in 25 rats. The mandibular ramus was exposed on one side (experimental side) after elevation of a muscle-periosteal flap. A teflon capsule was placed with its opening facing the periosteum at the subsurface of the raised muscle-periosteal flap after suturing In the contralateral side serving as control, the periosteum of the lateral aspect of the mandibular ramus was left intact. This time the teflon capsule was placed with its opening facing the periosteum left behind at the ramus. The histological analysis demonstrated that in all experimental and control specimens, some bone was produced at 7 days after operation. In the experimental specimens, however, both the incidence and the amount of newly-formed bone in the teflon capsules gradually decreased from 7 to 120 days, while increasing in the control capsules placed over the periosteum. At 120 days, the mean amount of new bone produced in the experimental capsules was 3% (range 0-15%) of the total space created by the capsule, while it was 68% (range 41-85%) for the control capsules. The results demonstrated that substantial amounts of bone can be produced predictably by the placement of an occlusive teflon capsule facing mandibular covered with periosteum.

In contrast to ceramic biomaterials, Polyactive(R) is a flexible material. In a previous three-dimensional finite element analysis study, it was stated that application of a flexible Polyactive(R) coating simulates the function of the periodontal ligament. The topic of this investigation was to compare the bone-bonding capacity of Polyactive(R)-coated titanium implants with hydroxylapatite (HA) coated implants. The implants were inserted bilaterally in the edentulous part of the mandibular bone of 12 goats. After 3 weeks, the implants were in close contact with the cortical bone, but no cortical bone reaction or remodelling was observed. After 9 weeks, an extensive bone reaction was seen around the HA and Polyactive(R)-coated implants and contact was frequently encountered between newly formed bone and the implants. Within the surface of the Polyactive(R) coating, a considerable amount of calcification was present. After 25 weeks, cortical remodelling was still apparent. A striking finding was the apparent association between osteon formation and calcification within the surface of the Polyactive(R) layer. Back-scatter analysis of the nondecalcified Polyactive(R) bone interface showed the presence of a calcium phosphate layer in the implant material that apparently formed a continuity with the mineral matrix of bone, suggesting bone-bonding. In general, it was observed that the bone reactions to HA and Polyactive(R) were comparable. A swelling of the coating, just beneath the cortical layer (champagne-cork effect) was often seen. This increase in volume, caused by water uptake, might result in a more intimate initial bone/Polyactive(R) contact, as compared with other implant materials.","LEIDEN UNIV, FAC MED, OTOBIOL & BIOCOMPATIBIL LAB, BIOMAT RES GRP, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","MEIJER, GJ (reprint author), UNIV UTRECHT, FAC MED, DEPT ORAL MAXILLOFACIAL SURG PROSTHODONT & SPECIA, UNIV WEG 100, 3584 CG UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS.",,"Meijer, G.J./H-8073-2014","van Blitterswijk, Clemens/0000-0003-2371-4615",,,,34,6,6,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1365-2842,,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

When stored below 10% RH, only one water molecule could be removed over a period of 3 months, whereas within 24 h at 30 degrees C in a vacuum oven, two water molecules were removed with no change in crystal structure. Increasing the temperature to 60 degrees C progressively removed the remaining three molecules, causing the crystal, however, to collapse into an amorphous form identical to one prepared by lyophilization. Rehydration at 30 degrees C, which was sufficient to reduce the glass transition temperature to <30 degrees C, rapidly restored the pentahydrate crystal structure. Rehydration of the methanolate also restored the pentahydrate structure. The significant amount of water accommodated by raffinose in both the crystalline and amorphous forms would appear to make it a potentially useful water scavenger in certain types of dosage forms.","UNIV WISCONSIN,SCH PHARM,MADISON,WI 53706; PURDUE UNIV,SCH PHARM,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907",,,,,,,,13,90,90,0,14,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

For this, carrier materials consisting of bioresorbable polymers, e. g. poly(L[+]-lactic acid) and poly(glycolic acid) can be used. In respect of the biocompatibility of these polymers, the effect of degradation products on chondrocytes is of major interest. The available biomaterials were tested on chondrocytes in form of their monomers, glycolic acid and L(+)-lactic acid. Effects in regard of cell activity were determined with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenytetra zoliumbromide(MTT)test. A non-pH-effect was examined by buffering with concentrated NaOH. In a short-term testing with increasing monomer concentrations as well as in a test over a twelve-day period, L(+)-lactic acid proved to have a lower cytotoxic effect on chondrocytes than glycolic acid. Similar results were obtained with buffered culture media. Therefore, poly(L[+]-lactic acid) can be recommended for the development of chondrocytes-polymer constructs for in-vitro engineering of cartilage tissue.","UNIV MUNICH,HALS NASEN OHREN KRANKENHEITEN KLIN & POLIKLIN,MUNICH,GERMANY",,,,,,,,0,9,11,0,2,GEORG THIEME VERLAG,STUTTGART,"P O BOX 30 11 20, D-70451 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0935-8943,,,LARYNGO RHINO OTOL,Laryngo-Rhino-Otol.,MAR,1995.0,74,3,,,,,183,187,,10.1055/s-2007-997715,,,,5,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,QQ438,WOS:A1995QQ43800010,7755857.0,,,,2019-02-25

A new multi-sample denaturation temperature tester (DTT) has been constructed for rapid determination of the collagen denaturation temperature of natural tissues and collagenous biomaterials. To validate the system, the denaturation temperatures measured for the DTT are compared with results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Data are presented for bovine pericardium in three states with denaturation temperatures ranging from 68 to 85 degrees C: fresh, or crosslinked with glutaraldehyde or the epoxide reagent Denacol EX-512 poly (glycidyl ether). Denaturation temperatures measured by DTT were not significantly different from those measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); however, DSC onset systematically occurred at a slightly lower temperature than that measured by DTT. This result, seen only for fresh tissue is in agreement with earlier experiments using hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) testing. By contrast, DTT and DSC onset were identical for the exogenously crosslinked materials. Since the measured transition temperature was independent of initial load, this variable may be chosen to yield sharper force-temperature transitions with a given sample geometry. This instrument allows accurate assessment of collagen denaturation temperatures for multiple samples in a fraction of the time required by other methods.",,"LEE, JM (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, 170 COLL ST, TORONTO, ON M5S 1A1, CANADA.",,,,,,,30,79,83,0,5,BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD,OXFORD,"LINACRE HOUSE JORDAN HILL, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 8DP",1350-4533,,,MED ENG PHYS,Med.

Thrombin is often used in vitro as a stimulating agent to check the specific functions of cultured endothelial cells. In the present work, and in order to select a thrombin of commercial origin, two criteria were borne in mind: purity towards the presence of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and effectiveness towards VWF release by human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) that have been submitted to four human commercial thrombins. We detected the presence of vWF in some thrombin solutions that have not yet been in contact with HUVEC. The different thrombins contained vWF antigen ranging from less than 0.1 mUnit per NIH unit of thrombin (from Diagnostica Stage and Sigma Chemical Co.) to 10-20 mUnit per NIH unit of Fibrindex (R) thrombin (from Ortho Diagnostic Systems). Thus, if vWF is present in commercial thrombins, it contributes to and overestimates the VWF appearance in the media resulting from cell stimulation. Consequently, we fixed on thrombin from Diagnostica Stage for further studies involving HUVEC on biomaterials.","UNIV BORDEAUX 2,INSERM,U306,F-33076 BORDEAUX,FRANCE; HOP ENFANTS,HEMATOL LAB,F-33076 BORDEAUX,FRANCE",,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1995.0,16,3,,,,,193,199,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)92117-O,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QG850,WOS:A1995QG85000007,7748995.0,,,,2019-02-25

Corroboration of SFM results is achieved using low voltage, high resolution scanning electron microscopy (LVHRSEM) to image the same protein molecule that is seen in the SFM. We obtain accurate height dimensions by SFM complemented by accurate lateral dimensions obtained by LVHRSEM. The use of 14- and 5-nm gold labels to identify specific membrane-bound biomolecules and to provide contrast enhancement with the SFM is explored as a useful adjunct to observation of unlabeled material. It is shown that the labels are useful for locating specific protein molecules on platelet membrane surfaces and for assessing the distribution of these molecules using the SFM. Fourteen nm labels are shown to be visible over the membrane corrugation, whereas 5-nm labels appear difficult to resolve using the present SFM instrumental configuration.

In animal experiments isolated respiratory cells were seeded into implanted tubular prostheses of porous polyurethane or expanded polytetrafluorethylene.

After thawing, each segment was preincubated in 0.5% albumin in PBS to prevent nonspecific staphylococcal attachment to surfaces that were not exposed to blood. Each segment was then incubated with 4 x 10(6) CFU of [H-3] thymidine-labelled S. aureus per mi for 60 min at 37 degrees C in an in vitro adhesion assay. Two site-specific mutants of S., aureus were tested: one specifically defective in adhesion to fibrinogen (Fg(Ad)-def). Compared with their respective parental strains, the Fg(Ad)-def, but not the Fn(Ad)-def, mutant of S. aureus showed a strong (> 80%) decrease in attachment to ex vivo tubings. The adhesion of each strain of S. aureus onto polyethylene was consistently more than twofold higher than the adhesion onto polyvinyl chloride segments exposed to flowing blood for 5 or 15 min, but adhesion became similar to that on polyvinyl chloride after 60 min of exposure. In conclusion, the specific adhesion-defective mutants of S. aureus suggested that fibrinogen was the most active adhesion-promoting protein in a short-term blood-material interaction.

The use of a cage permits in a serial fashion a quantitative and qualitative measurement of exudate components formed around an implant. Subcutaneously in rats, caped cages manufactured from stainless-steel mesh were implanted with in vitro predegraded, as-polymerized PLLA, as-polymerized PLLA cylinders, and empty cages serving as controls. In vitro predegradation was used to simulate the degradation products of long-term in vitro degradation. Predegraded PLLA particles were obtained by in vitro hydrolysis at elevated temperatures. The first 7 days of implantation were characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction; the exudate extracted from the cages showed predominantly neutrophils for all types of implants. After day 7, there was a more chronic inflammatory reaction with predominantly macrophages and lymphocytes. There were no significant differences in the total leukocyte concentration or macrophage concentration for any of the cages in the period from 10-21 days. Extracellular enzyme activity also did not show any significant differences among the three types of cages. A possible explanation for the absence of any significant differences could be that the in vitro predegraded particles were sieved before implantation, thus eliminating all small particles (< 70 mu m) that are probably mandatory to provoke an increased cellular reaction.

Specifically, as the incorporation of carboxyl (COOH) group content increased on FEP polymer surfaces, monocyte adhesion and cytokine production were also increased on day 1 with IgG preadsorption. On day 8, all surface-modified FEP polymers showed significant (P < .01) inhibition of monocyte adhesion when fibrinogen or IgG was preadsorbed. However, without protein (fibrinogen or IgG) preadsorption, monocyte adhesion was not significantly inhibited compared to control TCPS. In addition, cytokine production detected by ELISAs on day 8 showed no detectable levels of IL-1 beta and significantly decreased levels of IL-6 compared to day 1 for all tested polymers, with or without protein preadsorption. Interestingly, the level of TNF-alpha production on day 8 remained high although not as high as on day 1. Based on these results, we suggest that FEP polymers with neutral hydrophilic surface properties may adhere and activate the least number of monocytes, which are important mediators of biocompatibility.

We have used a very simple, near-physiologic system whereby whole blood, anticoagulated with D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (thrombin inhibitor), contacts materials for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, under low shear. Unlike other tests of platelet compatibility that focus on adherent platelets, this assay evaluates the platelets in the whole blood drained from the tube (1.57 mm internal diameter, 25 cm length) after material contact. We demonstrate for the first time significant materials-induced microparticle formation. One-hour contact with Silastic, polyethylene, and polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel surfaces lead to 30 +/- 1, 33 +/- 4, and 43 +/- 4 x 10(9) microparticles/L, respectively, whereas resting blood samples contained only 10 +/- 1 x 10(9) microparticles/L. In addition, significant increases in activated platelet(s) binding to neutrophils/monocytes after material contact were noted for all surfaces tested. For polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel surfaces a greater than 500% increase in the fluorescent intensity over that of resting whole blood was attained. The addition of monoclonal antibodies to GPIIb/IIIa (A2A9), the tetrapeptide adhesion ligand RGDS (arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine), or the calcium ion chelator ethyleneglycol-bis-(B-aminoethyl-ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to the whole blood before material contact fully inhibited all platelet reactivity noted for all surfaces-platelet microparticles, platelet P-selectin expression, loss of platelets from bulk, and the formation of platelet/leukocyte aggregates-thereby indicating that material-induced platelet activation is a calcium-dependent process involving GPIIb/IIIa receptors.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT MED, TORONTO, ON, CANADA","GEMMELL, CH (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM, 100 COLL ST, TORONTO, ON M5S 1A4, CANADA.",,,,,,,36,116,117,0,4,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

The effects are evidenced by time dependant signal drift (particularly for those devices which are implanted intravascularly). Practical methods to reduce such effects require an understanding of the interface between the electrode and its environment prior to assessment of the potential areas for improvement. Current procedures employed to overcome the observed losses in electrode sensitivity (following exposure to whole blood) include surface modification of the outer diffusion limiting membrane (via variation in film porosity) or even biomimicry of the fluid cell membrane. At amperometric electrodes incorporation of additional inner perm-selective membranes has achieved a reduction in electrode passivation from undesirable surface active compounds as has the use of low polarisation potentials. Other studies have attempted to induce an aqueous barrier between the matrix and the electrode tip which physically prevents passage of cellular components from the sensor surface. Careful choice of the system and materials will ultimately lead to biocompatible non-fouling devices capable of functioning in an array of bio-environments suitable for clinical monitoring of the critically ill patient.","UNIV MANCHESTER,HOPE HOSP,DEPT MED CLIN BIOCHEM,SALFORD M6 8HD,LANCS,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,13,25,25,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0001-5172,,,ACTA ANAESTH SCAND,Acta Anaesthesiol.

The 0.2 ml hydroxyapatite-sol with a concentration of 14.8 mg/ml was injected into medullary cavities of rat femurs. Both sintered hydroxyapatite powder suspension and saline as comparative materials were injected into the medullary cavities in the same way. Reaction of the hydroxyapatite-sol in the bone medullary cavities was investigated histologically using light and transmission electron microscopes. After 3 days, new bone formation was observed by injection of hydroxyapatite-sol, while no bone formation was observed by injection of sintered hydroxyapatite powder and saline. Osteoblasts were observed endocytosing the hydroxyapatite-sol in the medullary cavities of the rats. Macrophages and undifferentiated osteoblasts were found around the hydroxyapatite-sol aggregation by transmission electron microscope. After 5 days, amounts of new bone increased and matured, forming trabeculae. Many osteoblasts were observed in a line along the surface of the bone. On the other hand, 5 days after injection of sintered hydroxyapatite powder and saline no bone formation was observed while at 10 days after injection, some immature new bone formation started to be observed. New bone increased and matured at 15 days postoperatively. From these results, it was concluded that hydroxyapatite sol only quickly promotes the formation of new bone in bone marrow and can be used as injection liquid of new biomaterials for bone formation.","TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,DIV INORGAN MAT,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN",,,,,,,,15,8,12,0,3,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

This effect on the already complex human blood theology can be used to our advantage in the screening of blood-contacting materials. An attempt has been made in the present work to evaluate the haemocompatibility of materials based on changes in microrheological parameters of human blood. Samples of materials of equal surface area known to be haemocompatible (medical grade silicon, polyvinyl chloride from blood bags) and materials known to be extremely haemo-incompatible (pyrex glass, copper, cotton fabric, all commercial grade) were incubated at 37.4 degrees C in freshly drawn anticoagulated whole human blood, and changes in the haemorheological parameters (whole blood, plasma viscosity, intrinsic viscosity of red cells, platelet aggregation, albumin fibrinogen ratio) have been evaluated. The results of the study show that alterations in the haemorheological parameters are reliable indicators to the compatibility/incompatibility characteristics of well-known substances and that there is a case for haemorheological screening of biomaterials in the overall framework of haemocompatibility tests.","INDIAN INST TECHNOL,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MEMBRANE TECHNOL LAB,BOMBAY 400076,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA; INDIAN INST TECHNOL,SBME,BOMBAY 400076,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA; NATL PLASMA FRACTIONAT CTR,BOMBAY 400012,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA",,,,,,,,14,4,4,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The polymers were synthesized with C-14 radiolabelled components incorporated into the polyurethane chain and the amount of radiolabel released during exposure to cells and medium was used as a marker for material degradation. The effect of diisocyanate, soft segment and chain extender chemistry on the susceptibility of polymer degradation was examined. All polymers showed a release of material into the tissue culture medium which was unrelated to the cells. A significant cell-dependent release of radiolabel-containing material was found from one of the polymers (a polyester urea-urethane, TDI/ PCL/ED) which increased linearly up to 96 h. The polyether-containing polyurethanes showed no significant cell-mediated degradation under similar conditions as measured by radiolabel release. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the cells adhered to the different polyurethanes. However, no effect of neutrophils on polymer structure could be detected by this technique. The cellular response to each polymer was evaluated by measuring release of elastase-like activity (ELA) into the tissue culture media. After 24 h TDI/PCL/ED showed the highest levels of ELA in the tissue culture medium. When TDI/PCL/ED was incubated with commercial elastase in vitro, a significant release of radiolabel was found which was comparable to the amount of radiolabelled material released from this polymer in contact with the neutrophils in culture. No significant amount of radiolabel was released from the corresponding polyether material (TDI/PTMO/ED) under similar conditions. This study has identified one enzymatic activity (elastase) as a possible contributor to the deterioration of biomedical implants in vivo in that the polymer which elicited the greatest response of ELA also showed release of radiolabel when incubated with elastase in vitro. The use of a live cell culture system to assess the susceptibility of polyurethanes to degradation has provided a significant step forward in understanding the mechanism of biodegradation.","UNIV OTTAWA,DEPT BIOCHEM,OTTAWA,ON,CANADA","LABOW, RS (reprint author), UNIV OTTAWA,OTTAWA CIVIC HOSP,INST HEART,DIV CARDIOVASC DIVICES,1053 CARLING AVE,OTTAWA,ON K1Y 4E9,CANADA.",,,,,,,20,47,48,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JAN,1995.0,16,1,,,,,51,59,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)91096-H,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QB054,WOS:A1995QB05400008,7718693.0,,,,2019-02-25

As a result, while these devices generally provide effective relief from painful, crippling and life-threatening disorders, they can also induce vulnerability to infection in the recipients. The surfaces of the implants are susceptible to colonisation by microbial biofilms. The cells in the biofilms are further protected against opsonophagocytosis and are also resistant to antibacterials. Device associated infections thus tend to be refractile to antibiotic therapy and in many cases the device has to be removed before the infection will respond to treatment. Infection rates per implantation operation in totally implanted devices, such as, artificial hips and knees, have fallen over the years to 1-2%. Devices that are partly implanted into body cavities or pass transcutaneously into tissues are particularly susceptible to infection. For example, infection rates of 2.3-4 5% have been reported for central-line vascular catheters. The incidence of infection is related to the length of time the device is in place. Infection rates for urethral catheters indwelling for more than 28 days approach 100%. While several ingenious approaches are currently being taken to modify the surfaces of biomaterials, it has not yet proved possible to reduce the deleterious effects on the host or frustrate the surface colonisation mechanisms that microbes have evolved as a basic survival strategy in natural aquatic habitats.","SW TEXAS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SAN MARCOS,TX 78666","STICKLER, DJ (reprint author), UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,SCH PURE & APPL BIOL,POB 915,CARDIFF CF1 3TL,S GLAM,WALES.",,,"McLean, Robert/0000-0002-0610-6143",,,,115,67,68,1,22,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1995.0,5,2,,,,,167,182,,,,,,16,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,RX895,WOS:A1995RX89500007,,,,,2019-02-25

Techniques have been devised for the preparation of sections through these encrustations in situ on the luminal surfaces of catheters and for mapping the distribution of calcium and magnesium in the biofilms. Transmission electron microscopy on these sections showed struvite-like crystals lying in the matrix and in direct contact with the catheter surface. Calcium phosphate (''bioapatite'') was distributed throughout the film and many of these amorphous particles appear to have cells at their cores. Freeze-substituted sections of biofilms also showed electron dense materials around cell-like shapes and X-ray mapping and X-ray scanning transmission microscopy on the catheter biofilms also indicate that mineralization-occurs around the bacterial cells. These observations suggest that in catheterized bladders infected by Proteus mirabilis, bacteria and crystals formed in the urine, adhere to the catheter. Further colonization and growth of the cells on the catheter and crystal surfaces produces the alkaline biofilm which provides the conditions for continued encrustation. The binding of crystals directly onto the catheter and the subsequent bacterial colonization of these crystals has implications for attempts to prevent encrustation by manufacturing catheters from biomaterials impregnated or coated with antibacterials.","UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,SCH PURE & APPL BIOL,CARDIFF CF1 3TL,S GLAM,WALES; OXFORD ANALYT LTD,HIGH WYCOMBE,BUCKS,ENGLAND; UNIV LONDON KINGS COLL,DEPT PHYS,LONDON WC2R 2LS,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,30,18,18,1,8,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1995.0,5,3,,,,,245,253,,,,,,9,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,TM915,WOS:A1995TM91500002,,,,,2019-02-25

It has a distinct microstructure made up of: prepolymerized beads, an interbead matrix polymer, a radiopacifier (barium sulphate (BaSO4) or zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)), and pores or voids; the radiopacifier is. found only in the interbead matrix of the cured bone cement. The mechanism of slow or fatigue crack growth appears to be initial micro-cracking through the interbead matrix, followed by coalescence of the microcracks to form a continuous crack. Thus, distinguishing the interbead matrix from the pre-polymerized beads is important for investigating fatigue crack behavior in bone cement. Backscattered electron (BE) imaging theoretically-facilitates discrimination of the radiopacifier, and thus, interbead matrix polymer, from the prepolymerized beads. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of BE imaging-and secondary electron (SE) imaging to enhance the contrast between the microstructural components in PMMA bone cement. Electron microscopy revealed that: (1) the damage zone in fatigue fracture of PMMA was characterized by microcracks ahead of the crack tip, and (2) in the BE micrographs, it was easy td differentiate the prepolymerized beads from the interbead matrix. Therefore, BE imaging can be successfully used to contrast the radiopacifier with other constituents of the cement.","UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT BIOL SCI,CATONSVILLE,MD 21228","Topoleski, LDT (reprint author), UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT MECH ENGN,5401 WILKENS AVE,CATONSVILLE,MD 21228, USA.",,,,,,,27,3,3,1,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1995.0,5,3,,,,,283,292,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,TM915,WOS:A1995TM91500006,,,,,2019-02-25

One of the simplest methods for better quality retention of thermosensitive materials is drying of the materials in a mixture with porous carriers. In order to determine the effect of carriers presence on the mechanism of dehydration process a set of experiments was carried out in a laboratory vibrofluidized bed dryer. The experiments were performed for three different carriers (wheat bran, ground rape and flour). Baker's yeast was taken as an example of a sensitive material. The effect of following parameters on degradation processes was analysed: concentration and kind of a carrier, temperature and flowrate of inlet air and frequency of a vibrated bed. The analysis of the results proves that temperature of inlet air and kind and concentration of a carrier are the most important factors affecting final product quality. The results show that the main effect of a carrier's presence on quality retention comprises changes of a structure of labile material. Sorptional properties of the carrier are less important. In second part of the work dehumidified air was applied as a drying agent to enhance quality retention of biomaterials. Results obtained are encouraging, however this method requires further research.","TIANJIN INST LIGHT IND,DEPT MECH ENGN,TIANJIN 300222,PEOPLES R CHINA","STRUMILLO, C (reprint author), TECH UNIV LODZ,FAC PROC & ENVIRONM ENGN,UL WOLCZANSKA 175,PL-90924 LODZ,POLAND.",,,,,,,7,3,4,0,0,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",0737-3937,,,DRY TECHNOL,Dry.

They cause clinical infections of prosthetic hip joints, heart valves and catheters, Biofilm formation may occur rapidly on contact lenses and their cases and hence contribute to the pathogenesis of keratitis, Formation of biofilms is also implicated in delayed post-operative endophthalmitis and crystalline keratopathy, Bacteria within biofilms are 20-1000 times less sensitive to antibiotic than free-living planktonic organisms, Existing experimental methods for modifying biofilm include the use of macrolide antibiotics that specifically impair biofilm production, and the use of enzymes to digest it, These may have clinical applications, as potential adjunctive therapies to antibiotic treatment, for these resistant infections, In conclusion, biofilm is an important cause of infections associated with biomaterials. Novel strategies are needed to deal with these.","INST OPHTHALMOL,DEPT CLIN SCI,LONDON,ENGLAND; INST OPHTHALMOL,ELECTRON MICROSCOPY UNIT,LONDON,ENGLAND; CITY UNIV LONDON,DEPT OPTOMETRY,LONDON EC1V 0HB,ENGLAND","ELDER, MJ (reprint author), MOORFIELDS EYE HOSP,CITY RD,LONDON EC1V 2PD,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,98,94,99,1,15,ROYAL COLL OPHTHALMOLOGISTS,LONDON,"17 CORNWALL TERRACE, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 4QW",0950-222X,,,EYE,Eye,,1995.0,9,,1,,,,102,109,,10.1038/eye.1995.16,,,,8,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,QK628,WOS:A1995QK62800016,7713236.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

In the present study, we applied in vivo ESR to evaluate antioxidant activity by monitoring the redox reaction of nitroxide radical and clearly found that the nitroxide is very susceptible to oxidative stress in vivo and quite useful to evaluate antioxidant activity non-invasively.","SHOWA UNIV, SCH PHARMACEUT SCI, DEPT HLTH CHEM, SHINAGAWA KU, TOKYO 142, JAPAN",,,,,,,,25,45,46,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1071-5762,1029-2470,,FREE RADICAL RES,Free Radic.

We show here that cells adhere well to pure GA gels; in addition, specific interactions involving matrix receptors can be studied when individual matrix molecules are bound to the gel covalently. When cells are grown on such substrates, morphology is comparable to that observed on ''natural'' matrix gels (reconstituted gels of collagen type I or of Matrigel): rather than being flattened as in monolayer cultures on tissue culture plastic the cells assume a rounded morphology and tend to form tissue-like aggregates. The effects of the artificial matrix gels are discussed in the context of previous publications on cell interactions with the extracellular matrix, suggesting that in addition to specific recognition of matrix molecules the physical properties of ECM by themselves can be decisive for cell differentiation. We conclude that gels of glyoxyl agarose a) provide a useful model to mimic the physical properties of matrix gels without the presence of specific adhesion factors; b) may be useful as a general, non-specific ECM allowing cells to be cultured in vitro under conditions favorable for differentiation; and cf allow to design a variety of ''synthetic'' ECM models composed of a chemically defined gel matrix, which can be supplemented with covalently bound molecules to be recognized by cell surface receptors.",,"HOHN, HP (reprint author), UNIV ESSEN GESAMTHSCH KLINIKUM, INST ANAT, HUFELANDSTR 55, D-45122 ESSEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,44,15,15,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1071-2690,1543-706X,,IN VITRO CELL DEV-AN,In Vitro Cell.

One of the most important areas in which technological advances have significantly enhanced surgery involves the use of synthetic materials for reconstruction of the body. These materials, generally referred to as 'biomaterials', are defined as materials intended to interface with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function of the body. It is important to recognize that biomaterials have rarely been designed specifically for this use. Instead they are generally materials developed with other applications in mind, but which have been found to be appropriate for medical use, often being modified or optimized for these applications. Thus these materials are generally no different in structure and properties to materials used in the chemical, aerospace or nuclear industries. It is the matching of the properties of materials to the specific and, indeed, unique requirements of surgical reconstruction, that is the key to biomaterials science.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,4,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA AEROPORT,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG 110 AVE LOUIS CASAI CP 306, CH-1215 GENEVA AEROPORT, SWITZERLAND",0268-1900,,,INT J MATER PROD TEC,Int.

However, it is difficult to establish whether the process is initiated by a type I electron transfer, or by a type II energy transfer reaction to form singlet oxygen. Usually, the involvement of singlet oxygen in photodamage has been indicated by the inhibition of the biological effect by a competitive physical or chemical singlet oxygen quencher, or by a rate increase in D2O, in which singlet oxygen has a longer lifetime than in H2O. Unfortunately, these techniques are not completely specific for singlet oxygen. Moreover, thermodynamic considerations suggest that photoinduced electron abstraction from appropriate biomaterials could compete with singlet oxygen production under in vivo conditions. This likely source of one electron-oxidized primary radicals, which can provide the precursors of the oxidative damage in phthalocyanine photosensitization, suggests the possiblity of modulated toxicity by interaction with chemical additives. Examples of such additives recently studied are ascorbate, tocopherol and quercetin, all of which are natural antioxidants.","NEW YORK BLOOD CTR,NEW YORK,NY 10021","ROSENTHAL, I (reprint author), VOLCANI INST,DEPT FOOD SCI,POB 6,IL-50250 BET DAGAN,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,44,81,82,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD LONDON,LONDON,"ONE GUNDPOWDER SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND EC4A 3DE",0955-3002,,,INT J RADIAT BIOL,Int.

The immobilization of herapin was carried out by covalent binding with glutaraldehyde as the coupling agent. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and time, were varied to optimize the binding of herapin. The efficiency of the immobilization was monitored with respect to the total amount of coupled herapin with a toluidine blue assay and the anticoagulant activity of immobolized heparin with a factor Xa assay. The hemocompatibility of the modified polylactide was estimated after blood-material contact by the activation of platelets measured with an enzyme immune assay for GMP140. Immobilization at ambient temperature and a reaction time of 2 h resulted in maximal heparin binding, high anticoaylant activity, and low thrombogenicity. Since the remaining unsaturated aldehyde groups of the coupling agent may cause a low hemocompatibiIity of the material, washing of the heparinized polylactide was carried out with ethanol. However, it was shown that washing diminished the anticoagulant activity of heparin and increased the thrombogenicity. The prolonged storage of heparinized polylactide in phosphate buffered saline for 8 days demonstrated that small quantities of herapin were released but the hemocompatibility was further improved, indicated by an increasing anticoagulant potential and a decrease in platelet activiation with incubation time. A comparison of polylactide, heparinized polylactide, polypropylene, and Pellethane(R) with respect to platelet activation by GMP140 assay and scanning electron microscopy, revealed that the heparinization of polylactide substantially improved the hemocompatibility of RESOMER(R) R208, making the material comparable to Pellethane(R).","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN, SCH MED CHARITE, BIOMAT RES UNIT, D-10098 BERLIN, GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN, SCH MED CHARITE, DEPT INTERVENT RADIOL, INST ROENTGENDIAGNOST, D-10098 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,"Seifert, Barbara/K-7569-2012","Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,33,16,16,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Polymers are the most diverse class of biomaterials. All biomaterials must meet certain criteria and regulatory requirements before they can be qualified for use in medical applications. Biocompatibility is one of the most important requirements. Both nondegradable polymers are designed to degrade in vivo in a controlled manner over a predetermined time. The main mechanism of in vivo degradation of polymers is 'hydrolytic degradation', in which enzymes may also play a role (i.e.'enzymatic degradation'). Both natural e.g., collagen, and synthetic e.g., poly(alpha-hydroxy) acids, biodegradable polymers are used in biomedical applications. Many of the current polymers and processing techniques need to be improved in order to produce polymers with better performance in biological media. An important trend in related research and development is the synthesis of novel polymers, which would exhibit improved biocompatibility, and be bioresponsive.","HACETTEPE UNIV,DIV BIOENGN,ANKARA,TURKEY","PISKIN, E (reprint author), HACETTEPE UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,ANKARA 06532,TURKEY.",,,,,,,63,77,78,2,48,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To better understand the reasons for wear and failure, methods were developed using polarized light microscopic analysis and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging with correlated elemental analysis to distinguish the contributions of wear, creep, and third-body particulate. This study determined that microscopic metal particles (<10 mu m) previously not observed with the stereomicroscope could be easily observed with the BSE technique. BSE imaging identified embedded metal in 5/5 of the tibial and 2/4 of the acetabular inserts, which were thought to be free of metal debris after stereoscopic examination. Correlated elemental analysis showed that the microscopic particles could be traced to the elements known to be present in the porous coatings of the retrieved uncemented implants. Creep was distinguished from wear in the total hip and total knee inserts by using polarized light microscopic techniques. Continued development of polarized light microscopic techniques applied in this investigation should assist biomaterials experts in the future to better distinguish wear and creep in retrieved clinical inserts. The correlated BSE and elemental analysis will assist in determining the roll of microscopic third-body particular in wear and osteolysis in total joint replacement.

Pure nanoapatite cylinders and organoapatite cylinders containing a synthetic nanopeptide were analyzed 28 days after implantation into the spongy bone of Chinchilla rabbits. The experimental techniques used for analysis were light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Both implant types were well incorporated, and interface events were found to be similar to those observed on human bone surfaces with regard to resorption by osteoclast-like cells and bone formation by osteoblasts. Different types of giant cells were observed resorbing the outermost surfaces of implants. There seemed to be both dissolution of the implant and particulate biodegradation leading to less dense implant regions near the interface, whereas the bulk of the implants remained denser. Transmission electron micrographs revealed that bone bonding occurred with and without an afibrillar intervening layer. Given the biologic reaction observed, these implant materials should be suitable for bone replacement and the organoapatite form could be useful for additional functions such as the release of drugs and optimized release of antibiotics, growth factors, or other substances. The organic component can also be used to control physical properties in a bony implantation bed.

Among eight antioxidants, 4,4'-butylidene-bis(3-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol), 2,2'-methylene-bis(4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol) (MBMBP), and styrenated phenol (SP) showed stronger inhibitory activities than lithocholic acid, which is known to be a tumor promotor. However, 4,4'-thio-bis(3-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol), Irganox 1010, and 1330 did not inhibit at any concentrations. When the single-electron oxidation potentials were compared among antioxidants, the electrochemical ease estimated with the first oxidation potential was correlated with the cytotoxic potentials (r = 0.88), but not with the inhibitory activities in an MC assay. The tumor-promoting activity of MBMBP was also investigated using an in vitro, two-stage Balb/c3T3 transformation assay. MBMBP did not show initiating activity, but significant promoting activity at concentrations of both 1 and 2.5 mu g/ml were noted. These concentrations were close to the lowest effective inhibitory concentration (1.3 mu g/ml) of MBMBP in an MC assay.

(1976) to organize the network of complex metabolic reactions occurring in the living cell, employing directed signal how diagram in which the enzyme reaction coefficient was defined as the metabolic transfer coefficient. Using this concept, a metabolic reaction between substrate A and product B could be regarded as a signal transmittance from A to B. A very simple set of linear equations was then derived to analyze the flow directions of the carbon fluxes and the degree of activation of certain metabolic pathways within a recombinant yeast, in which the specific consumption rate of galactose, the specific rate of change of ethanol and the specific uptake rate of oxygen constituted the three input nodes of the metabolic signal transfer system. The output nodes were the specific growth rate of the cells, the specific production rate of the recombinant protein and the specific evolution rate of carbon dioxide. In this may, the effect of the culture conditions on cell growth and recombinant protein production under control of the GAL10 promoter could be characterized in terms of the metabolic pathways based on observable variables such as the cell and product concentrations, and the carbon dioxide and oxygen in the exhaust gas. This approach was successfully applied to an analysis of the metabolic pathways occurring in the fed-batch cultivation of a recombinant yeast where galactose served as both the carbon source for cell growth and as an inducer for expression of the recombinant gene. The expression period was classified into three phases-named the switch, expression, and stationary phases-on the basis of calculations using signal flow equations. In the switch phase, biomaterials for cell growth were found to be synthesized through the TCA cycle and UR loop, and less galactose entered the induction pathway. In the stationary phase, on the other hand, the formation of biomaterials for cell growth occurred mainly through the PP and EMP pathways and the TCA cycle. The degree of activation of the induction pathway was reduced in this phase. Unlike in either of the previous two phases, in the expression phase a significant amount of galactose was directed towards the induction pathway to stimulate the expression of the recombinant gene, and the PP pathway played the major role in the synthesis of biomaterials for cell growth.","KYUSHU INST TECHNOL,DEPT BIOCHEM ENGN & SCI,FUKUOKA 820,JAPAN",,,,,,,,26,18,20,1,3,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

The metals tested: HS25 (a cobalt-based alloy similar to F75), 316L stainless steel, Ti-6A1-4V, and commercially pure tantalum, exhibited nearly a fivefold increase in adhesion strength above that characteristic of the polymeric materials tested (PTFE, silicone rubber, and HDPE). The present study examines physical and biological factors that might influence fibroblast adhesion to the biomaterial surface. The relation between surface charge and cellular adhesion was investigated in a controlled manner by measuring adhesion strength over a range of charge densities. The cells showed charge and electrical potential-dependent adhesion maxima, suggesting that surface alloying for optimum adherence may be possible. In a preliminary series of experiments adsorbed serum protein layers on a series of materials of differing adherence were investigated using gel electrophoresis to assess protein composition. Analysis of adsorbed proteins revealed little difference in relative abundance or total adsorption quantity.

Microbiological specimens such as viruses, bacteriophages, and ordered bacterial surface layers and membranes have played an important role in the development of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in cellular and molecular biology. Early STM studies involving metal-coated bacteriophage T4 polyheads, Methanospirillum hungatei, and Deinococcus radiodurans HPI layer clearly demonstrated that resolution was comparable to TEM on similarly prepared specimens and only limited by metal graininess. However, except for thin films or layers, novel biological information has been difficult to obtain since imaging native surfaces of such biomaterials as proteins or nucleic acids by STM proved to be unreliable. With the development of atomic force microscopes, which allow imaging of similar native structures, SPM applications have widened to include straightforward surface structure analysis, analysis of surface elastic and inelastic properties, bonding force measurements between molecules, and micro-manipulations of such individual molecules as DNA. AFM images have progressed from relatively crude representations of specimen topography to nanometer scale representations of native hydrated surfaces. It appears from the study of microbiological specimens that direct visualization of dynamic molecular events or processes may soon become a reality.","UNIV GUELPH,COLL BIOL SCI,DEPT MICROBIOL,GUELPH,ON N1G 2W1,CANADA","Firtel, M (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO,FAC MED,DEPT MICROBIOL,TORONTO,ON M5S 1A8,CANADA.",,,,,,,111,34,34,0,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0968-4328,,,MICRON,Micron,,1995.0,26,4,,,,,347,362,,10.1016/0968-4328(95)00012-7,,,,16,Microscopy,Microscopy,TN268,WOS:A1995TN26800005,8574524.0,,,,2019-02-25

It was observed that the surface crystallinity of polypropylene films was well correlated with bulk crystallinity. Smaller contact angles of polypropylene films appeared with higher surface crystallinity, which indicates that crystalline regions have higher surface free energy than amorphous regions on these surfaces. Minimum value in both albumin and fibrinogen adsorption was observed on polypropylene surfaces with a particular surface crystallinity (ca. 50%). The control of surface crystallinity including the size and distribution of crystalline and amorphous regions can dominate the fate of plasma protein adsorption.

We then examine its structural organization by utilizing available data from the primary structure, immunochemical properties, structural stability, solubility, microscopic images, X-ray diffraction data, and information on proteolytic fragments. By analyzing the amino acid sequences, we estimate the flexibility and hydropathy along individual polypeptide chains. We inspect the net charge and hydrophobicity of individual structural domains.

Ellipsometry was used for the quantification of adsorbed proteins. Selected proteins were detected with the use of antibodies. Using the lens-on-surface method it was found that the lack of FG (fibrinogen) in serum did not facilitate binding of anti-HSA (albumin), anti-IgG (immunoglobulin G) or anti-HMWK (high molecular weight kininogen) following incubation of serum with silicon oxide surfaces. Instead, the binding of these antibodies was virtually the same in serum as in plasma. Thus it seems that the behavior of fibrinogen in the ''Vroman sequence'' is essentially independent of these other proteins. With the wettability gradient method it was found that binding of anti-HSA increases with increasing incubation time at the hydrophobic end of the gradient when either plasma or serum was used. Anti-FG was found to bind to plasma-incubated gradient surfaces at both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends of the gradient at short incubation time. With prolonged incubation, binding of anti-FG decreased at the hydrophilic end of the gradient. Binding of anti-HMWK occurred mostly at the hydrophilic end of both plasma and serum incubated gradient surfaces with a binding optimum at about 10 min. With prolonged incubation the binding of anti-HMWK decreased. Binding of anti-IgG was relatively low on serum-incubated as well as plasma-incubated gradient surfaces.","LINKOPING INST TECHNOL, DEPT PHYS & MEASUREMENT TECHNOL, INTERFACE BIOL GRP, S-58183 LINKOPING, SWEDEN; MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT CHEM ENGN, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L7, CANADA",,,,,,,,45,8,9,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,0-8412-3304-7,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

Results: During the follow-up period, 6 silicone implants were extruded, compared with only one hydrogel implant. Histopathologically, both types of implants were surrounded by a newly formed fibrous capsule. Only the hydrogel implant gave rise to a granulomatous foreign body reaction against its own fragments, however.

At the present time, Dual Energy X Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is the most used technique, and is a safe and short examination. It can assess the quantity of mineral of any region of the body with a remarkable reproducibility (1 to 3 per cent). New machines are improved, and they permit many practical applications beyond the osteoporosis field. Thus, in orthopedics, we can distinguish several interesting topics. Peripheral risk of fracture can be evaluated because of good correlation between bone mineral content and biomechanical properties of bone. Even if a peripheral fracture occurs after a fall, low bone mineral density plays an important role, as in the case of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. In traumatological practice, a DEXA with a specialized advice has to be requested if the traumatism cannot fully explain the occurrence of the peripheral fracture. Low bone mineral density defines an osteoporotic state, with the possibility of selecting adequate therapy. The good reproducibility of the measurement allows early estimation of bone loss following a period of immobilization. Varying models of osteosynthesis can be compared in vivo, to evaluate a decrease of << stress shielding >> bone resorption. The role of stiffness of an implant on regional bone mineral content can be assessed. Likewise, periprosthetic bone mineral content can be measured in various regions, and followed over time. Specific software allows the exclusion of the region where the metallic prosthesis is projected. The reproducibility of this peripheral bone mineral content is 2 to 3 per cent, which individually allows an estimation of variations of more than 5 per cent. It will be possible to evaluate in vivo the influence of various parameters of the prosthesis on bone mineral content in controlled studies, such as the role of the shape, the position, the structure, the coating. Mineral content of biomaterials and bone grafts are taken into account. Focusing the X Ray beam allows ultrahigh resolution. Precise measurements of very small parts of bone such as rodent tibia or vertebra are possible. The good reproducibility (2 per cent) authorizes the evaluation of various parameters which modify bone remodeling, such as immobilization or activity, ovariectomy. Preventive or curative therapeutics which change bone mass can be evaluated in animal pre clinical studies. There are other methods of measurement of bone mineral content. Digitalization of radiographs is not sufficiently accurate and CT Scan generate high levels of radiation. The DEXA is actually the best compromise for an accurate and reproducible measurement of the bone mineral content in vivo. This method will certainly be an important tool in orthopedics for several clinical or animal investigations in the future.",,"MAUGARS, Y (reprint author), CHU NANTES,SERV RHUMATOL,NANTES,FRANCE.",,"Maugars, Yves/C-4026-2015; Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,0,5,5,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

Clinical studies were undertaken to identify prognostic factors and guide selection of the best treatment option for each patient with a ureteric injury, and to determine the feasibility and efficacy of endourological treatment in the management of these injuries. Experimental studies were designed to develop a new surgical bladder elongation technique for the reapir of extensive ureteric injuries and to determine the safety of double-J ureteric stents currently used for endourological procedures. The influence of previous radiotherapy, time of treatment, and site, kind and length of the ureteric injury on treatment outcome was studied in 137 injuries. The length of the injury was found to be the most important prognosticator of treatment outcome, probably because extensive injuries required diversions involving a high failure rate. Previous radiotherapy and late treatment also had negative prognostic significance, probably due to their frequent association with injury length. The feasibility and efficacy of endourological treatment were studied in 30 injuries. Attempt to perform endoscopic ureteric stenting failed in 14 cases. In the 16 successful ones, restoration of normal urinary tract and good long-term results were accomplished in all cases. Endourological treatment appeared to be particularly indicated for short injuries diagnosed early after the trauma. A new bladder elongation technique involving a particular Z-shaped incision of the bladder was studied in sheep. This bladder Z-plasty provided an average of 5.8 cm greater bladder elongation than the bladder psoas-hitch, with no complications or changes in bladder capacity. The effects of various double-J stent materials on pressure conditions in the upper urinary tract; on the urothelium, on urine precipitation (encrustation), and on urinary infection were investigated in vivo, in pig ureters, and in vitro, by cell cultures and bacterial adhesion assays. Pure polyurethane stents were found to cause long-lasting changes of renal pelvic dynamics and, consequently, to have deleterious effects on renal function. Stents made of ''modified polyurethane'' were found to be cytotoxic in vitro. Silicone(TM) and Hydro-Plus(TM) stents appeared to be the safest overall, as they caused less superficial epithelial destruction and host reaction than the others. Silicone(TM) stents, however, were found to be more prone than Hydro-Plus(TM) stents to encrustation. Bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation onto the various stent materials appeared to depend on the properties of the bacteria, particularly the presence of P-fimbriae, rather than on those of the biomaterials. Adhesion of a few bacteria onto indwelling stents seemed to be of no clinical relevance while formation of large biofilms was associated with urinary infection. This study provided prognostic factors for guiding the selection of the best treatment option for each patient. Endourological treatment proved to be simple and effective for short injuries diagnosed early after the trauma. The bladder Z-plasty was found to be safe and effective for the repair of extensive ureteric injuries. Silicone(TM) and Hydro-Plus(TM) ureteric stents appeared to be the safest overall, as they were not cytotoxic, had no deleterious effects on renal function and caused less epithelial destruction and host reaction than the others. Hydro-Plus(TM) stents, however, appeared to be more suitable than Silicone(TM) stents for long-term ureteric stenting, as they were found to be less prone to encrustation.",,"CORMIO, L (reprint author), UNIV BARI, CHAIR UROL R, PZA G CESARE 11, I-70124 BARI, ITALY.",,,,,,,211,2,2,0,3,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",0036-5599,,,SCAND J UROL NEPHROL,Scand.

We performed biocompatibility tests with materials or plasma substitutes by interaction of blood from healthy volunteers and then subjected these blood samples to platelet function analysis (Thrombostat). We tested also the capacity of locally applied hemostatic agents for bleeding control by direct application of these agents onto the Thrombostat measuring cell. The biocompatibility tests with materials exposed to blood appeared very discriminating between compatible and noncompatible materials. The hemostatic capacity of blood exposed to noncompatible materials (assessed by binding of active thrombin) reduced markedly after one hour incubation of the material. The plasma substitutes did not affect hemostasis significantly. However, a blood dilution of 40%, as in cardiopulmonary bypass, increased the time required for closure of the measuring cell by a platelet plug exponentially. Local hemostatic agents could be selected according to their capacity to enhance platelet plug formation. In addition, ADP mixed with the hemostatic agent was most effective in improving capacity. We conclude that platelet function analysis contributes importantly to screening of materials and plasma substitutes with regard to their interaction with primary hemostasis.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT BLOOD INTERACT RES,9712 KZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,1,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"381 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10016",0094-6176,,,SEMIN THROMB HEMOST,Semin.

The dependence of metal ion binding on solution pH was studied for the biomass both free in solution and immobilized in a polysilicate matrix. A significant change in the pH-dependent binding of each of these metals was observed when the cell material was immobilized. These variations in the impact of metal solution pH could not be explained by the Lewis acidity of the metal ions. The involvement of conformational changes of the macromolecular components of the material for the formation of metal-selective coordination sites is postulated.","NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,LAS CRUCES,NM 88003; LOS ALAMOS NATL LAB,DIV LIFE SCI,GENOM & STRUCT BIOL GRP,LOS ALAMOS,NM 87545",,,,,,,,22,12,12,0,1,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",0149-6395,,,SEPAR SCI TECHNOL,Sep.

The patients were followed from 1 to 11 years by physician examination, The follow-up rate was 87%. There were four recurrences, The causes of recurrence and how to avoid them are herein discussed. Three of the recurrences occurred at the pubic tubercle and were caused by placing the mesh in juxtaposition to the tubercle, This error has since been corrected by overlapping the mesh at the pubic bone, One recurrence was caused by a disruption of the lower edge of the mesh from the shelving margin of Poupart's ligament, The error here was the utilization of a patch that was too narrow and therefore under tension, It became apparent that a wider patch, fixed in place with an appropriate degree of laxity, was required.",,"AMID, PK (reprint author), LICHTENSTEIN HERNIA INST,9201 SUNSET BLVD,LOS ANGELES,CA 90069, USA.",,,,,,,0,43,44,0,1,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0941-1291,,,SURG TODAY,Surg.

The patterns obtained for the eight-monolayer (LB) films of the RCs from Rb. sphaeroides and Rps. viridis show well defined Kiessig fringes. This confirms the preparation of molecularly smooth (roughness less than 1.5 nm), flat RC films and allows us to estimate their thickness as 30.5 and 34.0 nm respectively. Well ordered RC deposition took place only onto the ''front'' side of the substrate, which faces the moving barrier in the Langmuir trough. X-ray reflectivity measurements of LB films of RCs from C. aurantiacus show no Kiessig fringes, independent of the side of the glass plate; this can be explained due to the formation of an unordered protein film during LB deposition. These effects are due to the high asymmetry of the RCs from Rb. sphaeroides and, especially, Rps. viridis in comparison with the RCs from C. aurantiacus.","RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,INST CRYSTALLOG,MOSCOW 117333,RUSSIA","ZAITSEV, SY (reprint author), RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOORGAN CHEM,UL MIKLUCHO MAKLAYA 16-10,MOSCOW 117871,RUSSIA.",,"Lvov, Yuri/E-7633-2012","Zaitsev, Sergei/0000-0003-1533-8680",,,,15,7,8,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,JAN 1,1995.0,254,1-2,,,,,257,262,,10.1016/0040-6090(94)06238-G,,,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,QB761,WOS:A1995QB76100041,,,,,2019-02-25

The authors evaluated two bone substitutes in a posterolateral spinal arthrodesis (PSA) model in sheep: coral porites (99% calcium carbonate, Biocoral Registered Trademark , Inoteb, France) and a biphasic ceramic (BCP) (65% hydroxyapatite and 35% B tricalcium phosphate, Triosite Registered Trademark, Zimmer International). Summary of Background Data, Bone substitutes would be of great interest for PSA. Previous trials began with two kinds of biomaterials: natural coralline calcium carbonate, and phosphate calcium ceramic. Methods. A lumbar PSA was performed in 11 sheep (coral group) and in 9 sheep (BCP group). Sacrifice and biomechanical tests were performed after 1 year. Results. A large decrease of flexibility in all directions was obtained with both coral PSA and BCP PSA similarly to autologous graft. No nonfusion case was observed. Conclusion, in conditions close to the human surgery, a PSA can be obtained using either coral porites or BCP as bone substitutes.","INST CALOT,INST RECH MALADIES SQUELETTE,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE; INST CALOT,CHIRURG RACHIS SERV,BERCK,FRANCE; ECOLE NATL SUPER ARTS & METIERS,BIOMECH LAB,PARIS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,0,38,38,0,5,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,DEC 15,1994.0,19,24,,,,,2798,2803,,10.1097/00007632-199412150-00012,,,,6,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,PY226,WOS:A1994PY22600012,7899982.0,,,,2019-02-25

The purpose of this study was to develop a rat model in which capsular contracture occurred frequently and to determine whether surface texturing had any effect on the incidence or degree of capsular contracture as determined by in vivo biomechanical analysis of tissue modulus and histological examination of the tissue at the capsule-implant interface. A new sublatissimus implantation site in the rat was developed in an attempt to avoid subpannicular placement, which has been associated with inconsistent results because of contracture despite texturing, and a high rate of implant exposure secondary to trauma. Each rat (N = 43) was implanted with two devices-one smooth-surface 6-ml implant and one textured Biocell 6-ml implant-both with remote ports to allow for biomechanical analysis. Evaluation was carried out at 1, 2, and 3 months (n = 10) and 6 months (n = 5). Biomechanical evaluation of the implants was carried out in vivo and anonymously. The animals were then killed, and sectioning of the overlying capsule-implant interface from the dome of the implant was performed. Histological evaluation was carried out anonymously with regards to the implant type. Capsular contracture developed in smooth-surface devices in 95% of sites; this became evident on biomechanical analysis at 2 months and progressed to 3 months, after which it remained relatively stable. Capsular contracture did not develop in textured devices, but in all cases there was tissue adherence of the capsule to the implant at the interface. Histology confirmed disruption of collagen fiber alignment, increased cellularity and vascularity, and overall thinner capsules around the textured Biocell implants. This rat model provides an inexpensive animal model for further investigation of a difficult clinical problem. In vivo biomechanical analysis to determine tissue modulus has again been shown to be a sensitive method of defining overall soft-tissue contracture around implanted biomaterials.","SURG RES LAB,NASHVILLE,TN; BAPTIST HOSP,INST AESTHET & RECONSTRUCT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN; GRAND RAPIDS AREA MED EDUC CTR INC,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,GRAND RAPIDS,MI",,,,,,,,12,32,33,1,2,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",0148-7043,,,ANN PLAS SURG,Ann.

Human serum was incubated with microcapsules, and complement activation was evaluated by two methods: the complement hemolytic activity (CH50) and the assay of the C3adesArg fragment. The occurrence of complement activation in the presence of microcapsules was suggested both by a CH50 decrease and by high C3adesArg levels despite C3adesArg adsorption to the capsule membrane. Capsule membrane protection against the cytotoxic effects of complement was also tested. No hemolysis occurred when microencapsulated sensitized sheep erythrocytes were incubated with activated complement.

Some new poly(amidoamines) with more resistance towards hydrolytic degradation than traditional ones have been discovered. Other ter-amino polymers deriving from the polyaddition of ter-amino functionalized bis-thiols to bis-acrylic esters, or other activated unsaturated compounds, have been studied.

Scanning electron microscopy observations of the surface of the seeded ceramic disks revealed that cells attached, spread, and proliferated on the material surface. Soaking in cell-free culture medium showed that no change occurred in the surface structure. However, when cultured with bone cells and observed under a transmission electron microscope, an electron-dense layer was noted initially at the surface of the material, before bone formation occurred. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis demonstrated the presence of calcium and phosphorus in this layer. Progressively, during the following days of culture, active osteoblasts synthetized and laid down an osteoid matrix composed of numerous collagen fibrils arranged either parallel or perpendicularly to the first-formed electron-dense layer. Mineralization initiated on the ceramic surface dispersed then along the collagenous fibrils, leading to a mineralized matrix which surrounded the ceramic particles. These results demonstrate the capacity of apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic to initiate biomineralization in osteoblast cultures and to achieve a direct bond between the surface apatite layer of the bioactive glass-ceramic and the mineralized bone matrix.","UNIV PARIS 07,BIOL ODONTOL LAB,PARIS,FRANCE; OSAKA KYOIKU UNIV,FAC ENGN,SAKYO KU,KYOTO 60601,JAPAN; UNIV PARIS 07,BIOL DEV LAB,F-75251 PARIS 05,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,40,42,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0171-967X,,,CALCIFIED TISSUE INT,Calcif.

The experimental results in the field of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) research within the last few years have shown that it is possible to combine osteoinductive proteins with suitable carrier materials to obtain new composite osteoinductive biomaterials. These carrier materials function as slow-delivery systems for BMP. By combination of BMP with different carrier materials such as various types of calcium phosphate ceramics, collagen or inactive collagenous bone matrix, and other organic and inorganic carriers, the biomaterial can be adapted to clinical demands in a wide range. In several experimental animal studies, we investigated nine different calcium phosphate ceramics and inactive rat bone matrix for their use as BMP carrier. All materials tested seem to be suitable carriers for BMP.

Samples of bone were sandwiched between holders of a different material and using this specimen configuration a new technique was developed to test the fracture toughness of the bone interlayer. The effects of different specimens sizes and holder materials were investigated empirically. Using finite element analysis a correction factor was determined to account for the finite thickness of the interlayer and the analytical solutions governing the test specimen were accordingly modified. Bulk compact tension specimens of bone were tested for comparison. Bath wet and dry bone were evaluated and the fracture surface morphology characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate no statistically significant differences between the fracture toughness values obtained from the compact tension and sandwich specimens. The application of this technique to the testing of interfacial bonding between bone and biomaterials is discussed.

Four days after implantation, specimens of the spleen and implanted rubber fragment were retrieved and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). In SEM, macrophages with membrane fusion and cytoplasmic spreading were noted on the surfaces of implanted rubber fragments. Specimens of the spleen from animals with implants showed light 3-10-mu m structures that were not observed in those without implants. EDX revealed the presence of silicon both in the rubber fragment and in the spleen of the implanted animals. Both light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed a large number of particles inside giant cells of the spleen. The present study demonstrated an active transport of rubber fragments containing silicon from the peritoneal cavity to the spleen by adherent macrophages, reflecting a splenic response to intraperitoneal implantation of biomaterials. The modes of silicon rubber degradation and transportation remain to be elucidated.

To accomplish this objective, proper fixation, processing techniques, instrument quality control, and laboratory safety practices should be followed at all times. This paper reviews the methodology that has become standard practice in our laboratory for the evaluation of bone/implant interfaces. A regimen of fluorescent bone markers was used after implant placement to study rates of bone remodeling. At sacrifice, the tissue was perfused or immersed in an aldehyde or alcohol fixative. Implants were retrieved en bloc, radiographs made, and tissues embedded in plastic. Tissue implant blocks were cut longitudinally into 300-400 mu m thick wafers with a low speed saw equipped with a diamond blade. The wafers were glued to plexiglass slides and hand ground to approximately 25 mu m. Wafers were photographed with an epi-fluorescence microscope; radiographs were made in an X-ray cabinet; and the sections were stained for light microscopy evaluation. Various histomorphometric methods can be used to determine some variables of tissue remodeling around the implants from photomicrographs. Specimens prepared in this fashion can also be evaluated with a scanning or transmission electron microscope. These combined techniques provide a comprehensive approach for the evaluation of the bone/implant interface.","UNIV IOWA,COLL DENT,DEPT PROSTHODONT,IOWA CITY,IA; UNIV IOWA HOSP & CLIN,DEPT OTOLARYNGOL & PROSTHODONT,IOWA CITY,IA","KRIZAN, ME (reprint author), UNIV IOWA,HOSP DENT,COLL DENT,DIV ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG,N442 DENT SCI BLDG,IOWA CITY,IA 52242, USA.",,,,,,,31,6,6,0,1,NATL SOC HISTOTECHNOLOGY,BOWIE,"4201 NORTHVIEW DR, STE 502, BOWIE, MD 20716-1073",0147-8885,,,J HISTOTECHNOL,J.

The mechanisms involved in this process are only partly understood. STUDY DESIGN: Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) were grown on control polystyrene culture ware and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The binding of monoclonal antibodies against the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and the E-selectin by adherent HSVEC was determined by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were cocultured with HSVEC adherent to ePTFE and leukocyte binding was determined with and without the addition of a protein kinase C inhibitor. RESULTS: HSVEC adherent to ePTFE constitutively bound anti-ICAM-1 antibodies, which were attenuated by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7. HSVEC adherent to ePTFE bound significantly greater numbers of leukocytes than those on control (58 versus 41 percent, p<0.05). Incubation with H-7 decreased leukocyte binding to HSVEC significantly (p<0.005). Coculture of PBL with HSVEC adherent to ePTFE caused a tenfold increase in binding of anti-E-selectin antibodies (p<0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PBL binding to HSVEC adherent to ePTFE is, at least in part, ICAM-1 and E-selectin dependent.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT SURG,DIV GEN SURG,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,AMER COLL SURGEONS,CHICAGO,"54 EAST ERIE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60611",1072-7515,,,J AM COLL SURGEONS,J.

The immobilized biosignal molecules were not only bioactive without being incorporated into the cell, but also more active than free (soluble) ones. In this review, some evidence to demonstrate that the effect of immobilized biosignal is based on biospecific interactions with cellular receptors is shown. In addition, the explanation for the strong effect of the biosignalling, some efforts to further enhance the effect, and various applications of the biosignal molecules-immobilized biomaterials are described.

The inhibitory activities on the MC were first detected in both extracts prepared from PEU and silicone. PEU inhibited stronger than silicone, and furthermore the monomer of the soft segment of PEU showed the highest inhibitory activities among the constituents. As for the additives, three chemicals among eight antioxidants showed stronger inhibitory activities than BHT, a tumor promotor. Therefore, we propose that there is a possibility of tumorpromotion caused by these chemicals as well as soft segment rich oligomers extractable from the PEU.","NATL INST HLTH SCI,DIV MED DEVICES,SETAGAYA KU,TOKYO 158,JAPAN",,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0928-4931,,,MAT SCI ENG C-BIOMIM,Mater.

Polymers containing spiroorthocarbonates (SOCs) show promise in this respect, but their toxicology in copolymerized materials has not been explored. In this study, the in vitro toxicology of these materials in homopolymer form and in two trial non-shrinking epoxy co-polymers was evaluated for cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT test to measure the lethality effect on mouse L929 cells. Mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames-Salmonella Test. For comparison, commercial composite and adhesive materials as well as several other materials of current interest in dentistry were also evaluated. Epoxy resin samples containing 5% of either T/T SOC or Dp SOC reduced the cytotoxicity (TC50) from approximately 400 to 800 mu g/200 mu l. The epoxy-spiro copolymers had more favorable TC50 values than the commercial product Super-Bond. They showed TC50 values on the order of 35% greater than Super-Bond and 45% less than Scotchbond 2, the latter two being materials currently used in the clinic. These two comparatives demonstrated dose response curves with lower doses at maximum cell kill values than the spiro materials. The epoxy formulations all showed weak mutagenesis, but this is attributed to the epoxy formulation and not the SOCs. Although considerable toxicology is yet be conducted, these in vitro results suggest that biocompatible copolymer formulations for spiroorthocarbonates are a developmental reality.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108; MIDWEST RES INST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64110","YOURTEE, DM (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,SCH PHARM,TOXICORE LABS,2411 HOLMES ST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108, USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [P01 DE09696, R01 DE08450]",,,17,5,8,0,2,P J D PUBLICATIONS LTD,WESTBURY,"PO BOX 966, WESTBURY, NY 11590",1078-0297,,,RES COMMUN MOL PATH,Res.

The biological interaction between these materials and blood was studied by in vitro and ex vivo methods. Silicone rubber tubes were copolymerized with acrylamide and N-vinylpyrrolidone by radiation-grafting techniques. The irradiation was performed with gamma-rays from a Co-60 source at a constant dose rate (0.2 kGy/h) for various time intervals (4-15 h). To evaluate the antithrombogenicity of the grafted tubes, the surface adsorption of I-125-albumin and I-125-fibrinogen was studied. All graft copolymers show a preference for albumin, and the degree of preference appears to correlate with antithrombogenic tendency. In the ex vivo experiment with animals, tubes were implanted in the carotid artery of dogs and the blood flow in the graft copolymers was detected with an ultrasonic flow meter. The blood flow rate in the ungrafted implants decreased more rapidly (stopped completely after 15 to 210 min) compared to the flow rate in the grafted ones (decreased slowly from 38 to 35 ml/min and 70 to 60 ml/min). There was a direct relationship between both methods in the study of blood compatibility of the materials. The results suggest that the graft copolymers can be used as biomaterials for long-term use in cardiovascular systems.","EFEI, INST CIENCIAS, DEPT CIENCIAS, BR-37500000 ITAJUBA, BRAZIL; IPEN CNEN SP, BR-05508900 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL; INCOR, INST CORACAO, BR-01246903 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,0,ASSOC BRAS DIVULG CIENTIFICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE MEDICINA, SALA 21, 14049 RIBEIRAO PRETO, SAO PAULO, 00, BRAZIL",0100-879X,,,BRAZ J MED BIOL RES,Brazilian J.

The macrophages could be differentiated from fibroblasts and the other infiltrated cells for special cellular profile and strong acid phosphatase activity. Morphologically, monocyte-macrophages and infused multinuclear giant cell degraded CHA and TCP by phagocytosis and extracellular resorption. The carbonic anhydrase activity of macrophages was demonstrated by histochemical technique. It suggested that macrophages secreted H+ and accomplished the decalcification of calcium phosphate compound of CHA and TCP.

These polymers were evaluated with respect to their possible use as radiopaque implant biomaterials-that is, materials that are visible in a noninvasive manner using routine X-ray absorption imaging techniques. Polymer A is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 1 (80 and 20 mol%, respectively). Polymer B was prepared from MMA, 1, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) (mel ratio 65:20:15, respectively). Compound 1 was synthesized from 4-iodophenol and methacryloyl chloride. The resulting polymers were characterized with GPC, DSC, NMR, and by measuring both the advancing and receding contact angles. Thrombogenicity of the polymers was determined by an in vitro thrombin generation test procedure. The maximum concentration of free thrombin was 76 +/- 1 nM for polymer A, and 64 +/- 3 nM for polymer B. The lag times (i.e., time onset of thrombin generation) were 392 seconds for polymer A and 553 seconds for polymer B. For PVC-T, which is known as a passive material, a lag time of 583 seconds was found. This indicates that polymer B is comparable to PVC-T, and more passive than polymer A. Polymer A exhibited minor activation of platelets. Polymer B did not induce platelet activation at all. The polymers exhibited, even as fibers with a diameter of ca. 0.3 mm, good radiopacity with routine imaging X-ray techniques in the clinic. It is argued that polymers A and B-which actually represent a whole family of radiopaque polymeric biomaterials-exhibit promising properties with respect to applications as construction materials for a new generation of endovascular stents.

Using a computer-assisted cell counting method, it was shown that the membrane thickness was a stable parameter that poorly correlated with the other histomorphometric parameters except fibrocyte distance parameters. Macrophages were significant in number only in the short term and were always located at the implant-tissue interface. At 4 weeks, the period corresponding to which macrophages disappeared, fibrocytes were found nearer the interface than at earlier periods and did not migrate for up to 52 weeks, although their densities decreased to 50% of their initial values. Therefore, it can be histomorphometrically confirmed that 1) the presence of an implant induced delay in the healing process; 2) the immune system was not usually involved in the response to bulk metals; and 3) at early time periods, the presence of PMN cells was correlated to the long-term number of macrophages. On the contrary, the histomorphometric findings suggested that around the tested materials, a large number of macrophages did not induce an immediate or a delayed fibrocyte proliferation. If one considers that a low fibrocyte surface density is related to activated cells surrounded by a matrix high in collagen content, then the large number of macrophages induced the stimulation of collagen synthesis by the fibrocytes already included in the membrane. Accordingly, in the short-term, a high fibrocyte density and few macrophages may be a criterion for testing biocompatibility.

However, with rare exceptions, only IOLs designed for adults are currently available. These lenses may be difficult to insert into small eyes. Since the pediatric crystalline lens is smaller than that of adults and because the capsular bag does not continue to grow after lensectomy, it is worthwhile to determine the biomaterials, designs, and sizes that may be appropriate for pediatric implantation. In a study of 50 pediatric eyes obtained postmortem, we have documented an estimated growth curve for the developing crystalline lens between birth and 16 years of age. Ninety percent of crystalline lens growth occurs during the first two years of life. Based on these data and this study using the Miyake posterior view analysis of implanted standard and prototype IOLs, we recommend the following: Clinical trials of capsular IOLs, downsized to approximately 10.0 mm diameter, are appropriate for children under two years of age. Capsular IOLs are defined as flexible open-loop, one-piece, all poly(methyl methacrylate), modified C-loop designs made specifically for in-the-bag placement. Because the rapid growth phase of the lens is complete by the age of two, we believe that downsizing the IOL is not necessary after this age unless axial length measurements indicate an unusually small eye. Standard flexible 12.0 mm to 12.5 mm diameter capsular IOLs can be safely implanted.

Four interrelated properties of biomaterials (chemical composition, surface energy, surface roughness, and surface topography) affect mesenchymal cells in vitro. Attachment, proliferation, metabolism, matrix synthesis, and differentiation of osteoblast-like cell lines and primary chondrocytes are sensitive to one or more of these properties. The nature of the response depends on cell maturation state. Rarely do differentiated osteoblasts or chondrocytes see a material prior to its modification by biological fluids, immune cells and less differentiated mesenchymal cells in vivo. Studies using the rat marrow ablation model of endosteal wound healing indicate that ability of osteoblasts to synthesize and calcify their extracellular matrix is affected by the local presence of the material. Changes in the morphology and biochemistry of matrix vesicles, extracellular organelles associated with matrix maturation and calcification, seen in normal endosteal healing, are altered by implants. Moreover, the material exerts a systemic effect on endosteal healing as well. This may be due to local effects on growth factor production and secretion into the circulation, as well as to the tact that the implant may serve as a bioreactor.

The model proposes a reaction-diffusion mechanism for multiple proteins, involving interactions between diffusive-convective protein transport from the bulk solution and competitive adsorption and displacement kinetics-on the surface. The resulting equations in time and space were solved numerically with a finite difference approach. Using a simulated dilute plasma solution consisting of albumin, immunoglobulin-gamma, and fibrinogen at their physiological proportions, the phenomenon of sequential protein adsorption and displacement on the surface(known as the Vroman effect), was shown. Explanations were obtained for several other phenomena observed by biomaterials researchers studying protein adsorption. The model also allows the study of how the modification of surface parameters can determine adsorption behavior. This study not only demonstrates the complexity of the adsorption process but also shows that it can be quantified by comprehensive models.

We have exploited differently modified polystyrenes, specific component-depleted sera, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to leukocyte integrins to ask what adhesion mechanisms mediate human blood monocyte adhesion to different surfaces in vitro. Preliminary findings are that monocyte interactions with fluorinated, siliconized, nitrogenated, and oxygenated surfaces are reduced by 50-100% when complement component C3-depleted serum is used for adsorption; reductions vary with material surface properties. Adhesion is restored on all surfaces when C3-depleted serum is replenished with purified C3. Monocyte adhesion to serum-adsorbed surfaces is inhibited by mAbs to the leukocyte integrin beta subunit, CD18 (mAbs 60.3 and MHM23), and partially inhibited by a mAb to the a submit, CD11b (mAb 60.1), suggesting adhesive interactions between adsorbed C3bi (the hemolytically inactive form of the C3b fragment) and the leukocyte integrin CD11b/CD18. However, adsorbed fibrinogen reduces the effectiveness of these mAbs, indicating that alternative adhesion mechanisms may operate depending on the propensities of critical adhesion-mediating components to be adsorbed onto different surfaces.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL33849],,,43,133,134,0,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Membrane materials were the uncharged regenerated cellulose, the synthetic polysulphone (PS), a positively charged diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-C), the negatively charged carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and acrylonitrile copolymer (AN). The experimental system involved perfusion with human fresh venous blood through different modules containing the materials in the form of hollow fibre membranes. Extracellular and intracellular aspects of blood reactions after the first contact with the materials were investigated in Ficoll-separated granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Investigations were done by release reactions of platelet activating factor (PAF), oxygen radical (O-2(-)), leukotriene B-4, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6). The intracellular activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was done by mRNA transcription of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG). From the set of parameters, release reactions were only measurable for PAF, PGE(2) and O-2(-) if a second stimulus (phorbol myristate acetate, lipopolysaccharide, zymosan and calcium ionophore) was used after blood-membrane interaction. Although the extent of the release reaction was weak, negatively charged membranes were, in general, more active. All dialysers exhibited the same increase in beta 2-MG mRNA transcription, suggesting that all blood-contacting membranes initiate the gene expression of beta 2-MG at the same level. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-8 mRNAs were demonstrated in the AN and CMC membranes rather than the other materials, which exhibit a lower transcription than the tubing set. As has been found, an enhanced generation of PGE(2) for both CMC and AN membranes supports, therefore, the concept of an effect of the negative charges of the materials in the gene expression of cytokines. However, this initiation does not lead to the generation of cytokines, even after stimulation with pyrogens.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; HANNOVER MED SCH,DEPT NEPHROL,KONSTANTY GUTSCHOW STR 8,D-30623 HANNOVER,GERMANY",,,,,,,,44,11,11,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,969,980,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90077-9,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600003,7530999.0,,,,2019-02-25

The breaking stress for each was determined by means of tensile tests in which a constant strain rate was applied, and a tensile test with graduated stress and relaxation defined the elastic limit, i.e. the point beyond which deformation becomes irreversible. The study of the stress-strain curve during this elastic period enabled us to obtain the mathematical function that governs these reversible deformations, which shows excellence of fit (R(2) > 0.98). The prime derivative at each point of the resulting functions is the elastic modulus, the best parameter for comparing the elasticities of the suture threads. Since breaking stress alone does not suitably define the mechanical quality of a suture, we propose the use of other parameters during the elastic period, such as percentage of elongation at a point 10 times lower than the elastic limit (safety coefficient of 10), and tensile stress and elastic modulus at the said point, which are more reliable in the assessment of the resistance and elasticity of these threads.","CLIN PUERTA HIERRO, SERV BIOSTAT, E-28035 MADRID, SPAIN; ESCUELA SUPER TECN INGN IND, DEPT STRUCT MECH, E-28006 MADRID, SPAIN; INST NACL ESTADIST, E-28046 MADRID, SPAIN","PAEZ, JMG (reprint author), CLIN PUERTA HIERRO, SERV EXPTL SURG, SAN MARTIN PORRES 4, E-28035 MADRID, SPAIN.",,,,,,,16,18,18,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,981,984,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90078-7,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600004,7841295.0,,,,2019-02-25

The structure and properties of collagen fibres are defined by the magnitudes of electrostatic and hydrophobic attractive forces between neighbouring collagen molecules within collagen fibres. The structure and mechanical properties of collagen fibre dispersions were studied by dynamic theological measurements and by polarized microscopy. Rheological measurements were performed over pHs ranging from 6 to 9 and over temperatures ranging from 283 to 298 K. At higher pHs, the fibre dispersions were found to possess more rigid fibres and stronger inter-fibre attractive forces. This response is argued to result from changes in the ionization of amino acid side chains, which result in larger net-electrostatic attractive forces. Raising the temperature caused fibres to rigidify through enhanced hydrophobic attractive forces. Gels formed by lower pH-higher temperature fibre dispersions possess different properties than gels formed at higher pHs and lower temperatures.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BERKELEY,CA 94720; CELTRIX PHARMACEUT INC,SANTA CLARA,CA 95052","ROSENBLATT, J (reprint author), COLLAGEN CORP,2500 FABER PL,PALO ALTO,CA 94303, USA.",,,,,,,35,66,66,3,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,985,995,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90079-5,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600005,7841296.0,,,,2019-02-25

SEM, scanning Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed no differences in surface composition but marked differences in oxide thickness, surface topography and roughness. Light microscopic morphology and morphometry showed that all implants were in contact with bone, and had a large proportion of bone within the threads. The smooth, electropolished implants were surrounded by less bone than the machined implants with similar oxide thickness, (4-5 nm) and the anodically oxidized implants with thicker oxides (21 nm and 180 nm, respectively) after 7 wks. These studies show that a high degree of bone contact and bone formation can be achieved with titanium implants which are modified with respect to oxide thickness and surface topography.

For kinetic and thermodynamic reasons, surfaces are different from the corresponding bulk of the material, and contain reactive (unsaturated) bonds, which in turn lead to the formation of surface reactive layers (e.g., surface oxides on metals) and adsorbed contamination layers. The encounter with the biological environment leads to further surface reactions modifying the surface, and to the adsorption of water, ions, and biomolecules, which are continuously exchanged.

It already occurs in living systems where the dielectric and conductive properties of biomaterials are vital in sustaining activity. The transverse and lateral properties of interfaces, including the effects of molecular ordering, are considered and it is suggested that the advent of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies provides a significant opportunity for nano-metric dielectric studies. An important feature, suggested for future exploitation, is the cross-coupling in interfaces of force fields arising from electrical, mechanical, chemical and entropic potential gradients.

The novel systems combine rhBMP-2 with dry powder microparticles of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The mixture of rhBMP-2 with PLGA microparticles is added to an aqueous solution of biopolymer to yield a semisolid paste. The biopolymers tested include autologous blood clot, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and sodium alginate cross-linked with calcium ion. Insoluble collageneous bone matrix was also studied as a control. Test articles were made at 0-, 10-, and 30-mu g doses of rhBMP-2 and implanted in 8-mm-diameter rat carvarial defects (which will not heal if left untreated). The animals were examined 21 days after implantation by radiography, radiomorphometry, histology, and histomorphometry. All tested materials containing rhBMP-2 restored radiopacity and normal contouring to the calvarial defects. Samples without added rhBMP-2 yielded only soft tissue within the defects. Histology showed restoration of inner and outer bone tables plus marrow constituents. The PLGA microparticles were significantly resorbed at the 21-day time point. Although small differences between delivery systems were evident at 0- and 10-mu g rhBMP-2 doses, all test articles performed essentially equivalently at the 30-mu g dose. Thus, novel delivery systems for rhBMP-2 offer the promise of combining the intrinsic bioactivity of the osteoinductive protein with pharmaceutically acceptable biomaterials.

The polyurethanes were selected to reflect variations in the hard-segment chemistry, soft-segment chemistry, and polyurethane hydrophilicity resulting from combinations of hydrophobic/hydrophilic soft segments. All materials were characterized using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, size exclusion chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The material surfaces were examined both before and after incubation with enzyme and control solutions using scanning electron microscopy. Biodegradation assays were carried out at 37 degrees C using cholesterol esterase (CE) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) under optimal pH conditions for each enzyme. The hydrolytic enzyme (CE) was effective in releasing degradation products that contained hard-segment components from some of the polyurethanes. HPLC analysis of products for a polyesterurethane synthesized with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) suggested that the bulk of the incorporated radiolabeled TDI was still covalently bonded within the cleaved chain segments of the original polymer and was not released as pure toluene diamine (TDA). The data suggest that urethane linkages in the soft-segment domains of phase separated polyetherurea-urethanes may be more prone to cleavage by CE than are the urea/urethane groups in the hard-segment domains. This could be related to the nature of the hard-segment domain structures. The oxidative enzyme (HRP) was not able to induce liberation of radiolabeled segments from either the polyether or polyester-based polyurethanes.

Whether promoting cell adhesion or selectively inhibiting cell-cell aggregation mediated by integrin cell surface receptors, RGD-containing peptides can be rationally designed to incorporate both stability and integrin specificity. Synthetic peptides containing this sequence have been linked to biodegradable biopolymers and introduced for the enhancement of dermal and corneal wound healing. By accelerating the healing reaction using RGD-containing peptides, the quality of regenerated tissue seems to be improved, the extent of fibrosis restricted, and the risk of microbial infection may be reduced. Controlling the degree of fibrosis that often accompanies the healing of wounds and the reaction of tissue to foreign materials can also be achieved by natural antagonists of fibrogenic activity of TGF-beta animal models of kidney fibrosis. These advances in the biotechnology of wound healing and tissue regeneration eventually will have an overall impact on the quality of health care.

Achieving control of cell interactions via ligand modification of materials also requires that nonspecific interactions of cells with these materials due to surface adsorption of biological macromolecules is minimized. Polyethylene oxide (PEG) exhibits extraordinary inertness toward most biological macromolecules and is thus receiving increasing attention as a component of new materials for controlling cell behavior.

We have employed self-assembled lipid microstructures in the development of a number of biomedical material applications. The blood substitute, liposome encapsulated hemoglobin, is being investigated for the in vivo delivery of hemoglobin without many of the inherent toxicities associated with the delivery of free hemoglobin. This investigation is currently focused on demonstrations of efficacy in stressed animal models and on the safety of administering this material in models of sepsis. The synthetic modification of phospholipids to include photopolymerizable moieties such as diacetylenes has resulted in the spontaneous self-assembly of a hollow microcylinder which we are investigating for the controlled release of growth factors in soft tissue regeneration. Self-assembled monolayers are also being explored for the ability to surface modify biomaterials for improved cell adhesion. Photolithographic techniques have been combined with monolayer deposition to fabricate coplanar patterns of cell adhesion and inhibiting moieties. This results in the ability to spatially control the adhesion of cells to biomaterial surfaces. These cell patterns can form the basis for understanding two- and three-dimensional cellular events on the biomaterial surface and for the fabrication of improved cell-based biocompatible surfaces. The spontaneous self-assembly of lipids to form structures of biotechnological interest presents a unique opportunity to exploit this class of molecules for biomaterial applications.

Treatments have emphasized replacement of the missing function by use of a transplant, an autograft, tissue synthesized in vitro or, most commonly, by use of engineering devices based on biomaterials. During the last few years solid progress has been made in the area of tissue and organ regeneration. This new approach is based on the discovery that certain simple chemical analogs of extracellular matrices synthesized by graft copolymerization of a glycosaminoglycan onto type I collagen can induce synthesis of physiologic tissue in lesions which otherwise heal spontaneously by synthesis of scar tissue. This approach offers serious potential advantages over the alternatives listed above since the graft ''grows out'' of host tissue. However, regeneration in the adult mammal has been successfully demonstrated so far only in skin (human, guinea pig), sciatic nerve (rat) and the knee meniscus (dog).

Recent advances in cellular and molecular biology of the growth and differentiation factors have set the stage for a symbiosis of biotechnology and biomaterials. Recent advances permit one to enunciate the rules of architecture for tissue engineering of bone and cartilage. The purification and cloning of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth factors such as platelet derived growth factors (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I) will allow the design of an optimal combination of signals to initiate and promote development of skeletal stem cells into cartilage and bone. Successful and optimal bone and cartilage formation is a synergy of inductive and conductive strategies governed by biomechanics, optimal load bearing, and motion. BMPs function as inductive signals. Biomaterials (both natural and synthetic) mimic the extracellular matrix and play a role in conduction of bone and cartilage. Examples of biomaterials include hydroxyapatite, polyanhydrides, polyphosphoesters, polylactic acid, and polyglycolic acid. The prospects for novel biomaterials are immense, and they likely will be a fertile growth industry.

In the case of polymeric elastomers, these iatrogenic effects are likely intermediated by absorbed host proteins that spontaneously bind to the device surface, promoting both bacterial adherence and thrombotic events. We earlier attempted to produce biomaterial surfaces that would selectively bind host albumin because albumin-coated surfaces were known to diminish both coagulation and bacterial adherence. To this end, an albumin-binding high molecular weight dextran:Cibacron blue adduct was bulk incorporated into polyetherurethane (Keogh et al., J Biomed Mater Res 1992;26:441). The modified material bound albumin selectively and reversibly and showed evidence of enhanced biocompatibility. However, similar to 30% of the surface of this material was evidently unmodified and still capable of exerting the above adverse effects. In the present work, we have covalently surface-modified polyetherurethane with sequential additions of acrylamide, amino-propylmethacrylamide, dextran, and Cibacron blue. This derivatized polyurethane preferentially and reversibly binds albumin, even from complex mixtures of proteins such as plasma. Furthermore, this material inhibits the clotting of nonanticoagulated whole human blood (for >16 hours at room temperature), perhaps by virtue of binding and activation of antithrombin III by the sulfonic acid residues on the surface-immobilized Cibacron blue. Finally, such surfaces, especially when bearing bound albumin, diminish the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a pathogen frequently associated with device-centered infections. We conclude that similar albumin-affinity surfaces may hold promise for the development of more biocompatible materials for implantation and blood contact applications.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EXPTL PATHOL, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA; MEDTRONIC INC, MINNEAPOLIS, MN USA",,,,,,,,37,54,56,0,11,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

In order to better understand how the bioavailability of these HBGFs can take part in the regulation of the wound healing processes, we have studied the healing effect of various chemically substituted dextrans (CMDBS) selected for their affinity for HBGFs, alone and in association with HBGFs. The CMDBS was obtained by substitution of methylcarboxylic (CM), benzylamide (B) and benzylamine sulfonate (S) groups in proportion of 83%, 23% and 13% respectively for CMDBS K that we have further used (Mauzac et al., 1985 Biomaterials. 6: 61-63). CMDBS K could 1: potentiate the biological activity of 1 or 2 FGFs, 2: protect 1 and 2 FGFs against thermal or pH inactivation, 3: protect a and b FGFs against proteolytic degradation (Tardieu et al., 1992 J. Cell. Physiol. 150: 194-203). CMDBS K was tested alone in cutaneous and bone wound healing models and for its ability to stabilize FGFs. Rats were punched and skin regeneration was studied by morphometric and histological analysis. The wounds (6 mm diameter) were filled with collagen plaster alone or soaked with CMDBS. CMDBS K in collagen plaster was able to induce a remarkable effect both on the kinetics and on the quality of the restored skirt. These results suggest that endogenous growth factors naturally released during the regeneration process could be trapped, protected and released by CMDBS. Taking note of the ubiquitous distribution of FGFs and their ability to stimulate a wide range of target cells, we have looked at the effect of CMDBS K in a calvarian bone defect healing. Adult rats were trephined (3 mm diameter) and healing of their defects were studied after 21 days. Only those treated with CMDBS show significant new bone formation and filling of defects.

Two tanning protocols were used for the membranes, a new one involving microwaving and glutaraldehyde treatment (NEWGA), and the other, a conventional method using glutaraldehyde treatment at room temperature (OLDGA). Untreated membranes (NONGA) were also implanted. Sections of the implants were examined by light microscopy and with the confocal laser scanning microscope focusing on neovascularization and incorporation of the implant. At 64 days, the smooth sides of NEWGA and OLDGA implants were not well incorporated, with scarring subjacent to the surface and dystrophic calcification of that side of the membrane. At the same time, the rough sides of the NEWGA and OLDGA were not calcified with a giant cell reaction around the porcine collagen. The best incorporation was found in the NONGA membranes with no dystrophic calcification, excellent neovascularization of all layers, and complete remodeling at day 64. After 5 months, the completely remodeled NONGA membrane still could be identified, and the NEWGA and OLDGA membranes were calcified with a giant cell reaction having a dense fibrous capsule. It is concluded that if cross-linking is deemed necessary, the microwave cross-linking method is advisable because in the early stages there is less reactive inflammation around it, and the implant surfaces should be rough with an open structure, making calcification of crosslinked collagen unlikely.

Ellipsometry experiments of the simultaneous adsorption of HSA and either IgG or fibrinogen revealed a preferential adsorption of the latter proteins. This is seen not only from the total adsorbed amount, but also from the adsorbed layer thickness and from the buildup of the adsorbed layer. However, in sequential adsorption experiments, where HSA was first allowed to adsorb, followed by rinsing and addition of either IgG or fibrinogen, the additional adsorption is quite limited. Consequently, when HSA is allowed to adsorb on its own at hydrophobic surfaces, it is not removed by either IgG or fibrinogen to any larger extent. Furthermore, preadsorbed HSA was not exchanged by HSA added after adsorption and rinsing, implying that the mechanism behind this effect is an ''irreversible'' adsorption of HSA at hydrophobic surfaces, possibly originating from a surface-induced conformational change of HSA at these surfaces. Analogous findings were obtained with both methylated and HMDSO-treated surfaces, using both ellipsometry and TIRF.

Such infections are very often induced by Staphylococcus aureus. To obtain information on tissue reactions and minimal bacterial challenge needed to create an infection related to untreated implant surfaces, we injected polyurethane tubing segments with a series of Staphylococcus aureus. The segments were subcutaneously implanted in rats. Implantation periods varied from 2, 5 and 10 days to 3 weeks. Specimen were evaluated using light and transmission electron microscopy. At least 0.25 x 10(4) of Staphylococci aureus were needed to clearly recognize that bacteria had been injected in the polyurethane tubing segments. The evidence was indirect, showing high infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages, but not bacteria. Furthermore, 0.25 x 10(6) S. aureus were needed to induce a persistent specific inflammatory reaction with high concentrations of lymphocytes, i.e. mainly plasma-cells, at 3 weeks. The results indicate that this model functioned well to obtain the wanted information.

From immunologic studies it is known that inflammatory reactions can be modulated by use of (anti) growth factors or anti-inflammatory drugs. Before this can be employed the role of individual factors (humoral and cellular) involved in the inflammatory reaction against biomaterials has to be studied. In this part of the study the role of macrophages is studied with and without depletion by use of the liposomes-mediated macrophage suicide technique. Crosslinked dermal sheep collagens were used as biodegradable test materials. The results showed that macrophage depletion increases vascularization, and decreases the infiltration of granulocytess into the collagens. The foreign body reaction, i.e. the infiltration of macrophages and giant cells was significantly inhibited, resulting in a strongly delayed degradation time of the biomaterials. However, macrophage depletion did not inhibit attraction of fibroblasts and even resulted in increased formation of autologous rat-collagen, which improved the biocompatibility and the function of the biomaterials as a tempory scaffold.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,CELL BIOL & ELECTRON MICROSCOPY LAB,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,36,14,14,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Bone marrow cells were cultured on the copolymers for 2 and 3 weeks. Differences in formation rate and mineralization of bone nodules were analysed using LM and TEM techniques. Formation of bone nodules was observed after 2 weeks on non-treated copolymers. However,no mineralization in these bone nodules could be detected during the 3 weeks of this experiment. Addition of calcium ions to the copolymers initially increased the calcium concentration of the culture medium and led to formation of mineralized nodules after 2 weeks. The two precalcified copolymers had different effects on the calcium concentration of the culture medium. Instead of nodules, two or three continuous cell layers were formed and mineralization was observed after 2 weeks. Longer culture periods resulted in more mineralization in close contact with the copolymer surface.

Macrophages are one of the cell types involved in both these responses. Initially macrophage infiltration is necessary to phagocytose cellular and other debris which result from implantation of a device. Wound healing can then follow. If, however, phagocytosis cannot be completed the macrophages may become highly activated resulting in a chronic inflammatory response. In this paper we examine the activation of human peritoneal macrophages, cultured on a range of materials, by transmitted and reflected light microscopy. The cells were stained for non-specific esterase (NSE), a macrophage marker and indicator of activation. The results showed that cells adhered to all materials tested, except for polyvinyl chloride. Polypropylene caused the greatest degree of macrophage activation, while hydroxyapatite and polytetrafluoroethylene caused the least activation. Macrophages cultured with metal phagocytosed some of the material. We conclude that this technique gives a good indication of the activated state of these cells and can be used in the assessment of the biocompatibility of materials with respect to the immune system.","ROYAL NATL ORTHOPAED HOSP,IRC BIOMED MAT,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND","MARTIN, M (reprint author), ROYAL NATL ORTHOPAED HOSP,INST ORTHOPAED,BROCKLEY HILL,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) underwent splenectomy or sham operation 7 days prior to the intraperitoneal implantation of rubber drain fragments (7 cm(2)). Bacterial translocation was measured 2 days after rubber drain implantation. The incidence of bacterial translocation was significantly higher in the group with intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation plus sham splenectomy than in the groups with sham splenectomy plus sham implantation, splenectomy plus sham implantation or splenectomy plus rubber drain implantation. An increase in ileal permeability of I-125-human serum albumin was induced by intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation and ameliorated by splenectomy. Splenectomy also improved the impaired intestinal motility induced by intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation.

The black color of the resulting materials indicates the presence of polypyrrole while collagen was verified by amino acid analysis of the hybrids. Collagen incorporation into the hybrid was found to be a function of pyrrole concentration used in the polymerization. When the concentration of pyrrole was high, the collagen loading was low and vice versa. This inverse relationship was also found in the hybrids' electrical conductivity. A 26% collagen content in the hybrid gave a conductivity of 1.4 S cm-1 while a 4% collagen gave a higher value of 62.4 S cm-1. Thermogravimetric data suggest that the two polymers exist in the hybrid as a blend. The nature of the interaction of the components in the hybrid is believed to be strong since collagen could not be extracted despite denaturation with sodium dodecylsulfate.","NATL UNIV SINGAPORE,DEPT CHEM,SINGAPORE 0511,SINGAPORE",,,,,,,,38,12,13,0,3,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

We have recently developed an in vitro test system to evaluate platelet/biomaterial interactions in whole blood. The system consists of a parallel plate flow cell and epifluorescent video microscopy (EVM). A glass coverslip coated with a polymer was incorporated into the flow cell, and blood was perfused using a syringe pump via a polymer-coated PVC tubing connected to the flow cell. Whole human blood was anticoagulated with heparin (2 U/ml), and the platelets were labeled with the fluorescent dye mepacrine (5 mu M). This system permitted real-time and dynamic observations of platelet/biomaterial interactions in whole blood under a defined flow condition. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this system, two different segmented polyether-poryurethanes (SPEUs), PU-PTMG(650) and PU-PTMG(2000), were chosen as test polymers. Surface characteristics verified with electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and contact angle measurements showed similar results in both SPEUs. Blood was perfused at a wall shear rate of 200 s(-1) for 20 min. Excitation light was applied for 2 s at 1 min intervals. The real-time image was then analyzed at each time point for the percentage of surface area of platelet coverage. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) levels were also measured before and after each run. PU-PTMG(650) showed a significantly higher number of adhered platelets than PU-PTMG(2000) at each time point. beta-TG levels of PU-PTMG(650) were also higher than those of PU-PTMG(2000), which is comparable to the results of EVM. Thus, this EVM system has been proven to be an excellent and highly sensitive in vitro analytical method for evaluating platelet/biomaterial interactions.","TERUMO CO LTD,CTR RES & DEV,INST BIOMED SCI,NAKAI,KANAGAWA 25901,JAPAN; WASEDA UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,TOKYO,JAPAN; TOKYO WOMENS MED COLL,TOKYO 162,JAPAN",,,,,,,,27,17,17,1,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

An effective approach for developing a clinically applicable biomaterial is to modify the surface of the material which already has excellent biofunctionality and bulk properties. This review article focuses on the surface modification of polymers by grafting techniques, which have long been known in polymer chemistry but are not yet widely applied to biomaterials. A grafted surface can be produced primarily either by graft polymerization of monomers or covalent coupling reaction of existing polymer molecules onto the substrate polymer surface. The major surface properties that should be modified include two kinds of biocompatibility. One is the surface property that elicits the least foreign-body reactions and the other is the cell- and tissue-bonding capability. In addition, physiologically active surfaces with, for instance, selective adsorbability may be required.

Tissue from aortic and pulmonary porcine valves was treated with chloroform-methanol and 0.625% glutaraldehyde and was implanted into young rats for periods of 21 and 60 d. The calcium accumulated was then quantified by atomic absorption. The effectiveness of this treatment is demonstrated by the detection of much lower calcium values than in the control group. For aortic valve tissue, the values obtained were 40.5 and 188.1 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight of tissue for implantation times of 21 and 60 d, respectively, versus 5.48 and 1.4 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight of tissue for the same tissue treated with chloroform-methanol, ihe values obtained with pulmonary valve tissue were very similar: 72.46 and 108.06 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight tissue versus 0.67 and 0.80 mu Ca2+/mg dry weight tissue for implantation periods of 21 and 60 d, respectively.

Cells which trafficked to the matrix blocks were recovered and characterized for surface phenotype using iluorescently labelled antibodies and flow cytometry (fluorescence activated cell sorting). Temporal information of the differential recruitment of cells was determined. The basic pattern of recruitment in response to the hydrogels was established and mimicked that seen in a local inflammatory response. Neutrophils (PMN) were rapidly recruited (1 d) followed by macrophages and lymphocytes (1-3 d). Cell surface phenotype studies included the determination of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, Mac-1(+) cells, and immunoglobulin bearing cells. Microscopic analysis revealed numerous activated PMNs and monocyte derived foamy macrophages. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry of frozen sections of the block revealed that macrophages, CD3(+) and natural killer tells were all recruited to the interior of the block. Ultrastructural analysis (transmission electron microscopy) showed highly activated macrophages, with abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles. Cells which remained on the surface of the matrix block were CD44 positive migratory cells. Electron microscopic evidence showed foamy macrophages with a varying degree of involvement with the hydrogel material. Surface scanning electron microscopy revealed numerous fibroblast-like cells coating the surface of the block. We suggest that these methods may be used to address the inflammatory response elicited with a variety of implanted materials such as hydrogels, silicones, ceramics and metals. Furthermore, this model has been useful in determining cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors under similar conditions.","USN,MED RES INST,WOUND REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM,BETHESDA,MD 20889","SPARGO, BJ (reprint author), USN,RES LAB,CTR BIOMOLEC SCI & ENGN,CODE 6900,WASHINGTON,DC 20375, USA.",,,,,,,14,19,20,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,AUG,1994.0,15,10,,,,,853,858,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90042-6,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PC347,WOS:A1994PC34700019,7986951.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the present paper we show that vitrification is indeed necessary. However, dextran, which exists as a glass at a higher temperature than does trehalose and thus might be expected to stabilize liposomes more effectively, preserves DPPC liposomes only when extremely large quantities of the dextran are added. Dextran does not stabilize egg PC liposomes and, in fact, inhibits the stabilizing effects of trehalose. Dextran also does not depress T(m)in the dry phospholipids and shows no interaction with the polar headgroup, as assessed by infrared spectroscopy. Trehalose, by contrast, depresses T(m)in dry egg PC by about 60 degrees C and depresses vibrational frequency of the phosphate in the polar headgroup to the frequency seen in the hydrated lipid, an effect we ascribe to hydrogen bonding between the sugar and the polar headgroup.

Twelve h after the challenge, enteric bacterial translocation, bacterial population levels in the cecum and serum levels of IL-6 and TNF were measured. Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes and the liver was observed in animals from groups 2 and 3, but significantly increased in group 4 with a concomitant elevation of serum levels of TNF and IL-6, as compared with group 1. Histological examination revealed a more pronounced inflammatory reaction in the peritoneum and distal ileum in group 3 than in groups 2 and 3.

The resulting polymers had weight average molecular weights ranging from 120,000-450,000, and their chemical structure was confirmed by elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The polycarbonates were evaluated as degradable biomaterials. Their surface properties were determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and contact angle measurement. The degree of surface hydrophobicity was related to the length of the alkyl ester pendent chain. The tensile properties were dependent on the chemical structure of the polymers: For thin, solvent cast film specimens, the tensile modulus varied from 1.2-1.6 GPa, and the strength at break from 60-220 MPa. The degradation of polymeric films was followed in vitro by measuring changes in mechanical strength for up to 40 weeks, and the decrease in molecular weight and changes in surface chemistry for up to 80 weeks. The length of the pendent chain affected the degradation behavior and strength retention; the polymers with short pendent chains were more readily hydrolyzable. For sterilization, ethylene oxide treatment was less destructive, as judged by molecular weight retention, than gamma-irradiation. Spin-cast films of all tested polycarbonates were not cytotoxic toward cultured rat lung fibroblasts. The cell response was influenced by the chemical structure of the polymer. The least hydrophobic polycarbonate (having a short ethyl ester pendent chain) was a more stimulating substrate for cell growth than the more hydrophobic polymers (carrying longer alkyl ester pendent chains).

The most promising examples then have to be selected for further development. This is primarily achieved by assessing performance in function tests. Where relative toxicity is important, cytotoxicity testing is an effective way of further ranking the potential products. Though cytotoxicity cannot be used to predict precisely in vivo toxicity, used in this fashion it can be successfully incorporated into the selection procedures of a product research and development programme. Four applications of cytotoxicity testing in an industrial research environment will be discussed. Primary screening of metal complexes for potential antitumour activity by evaluating selective cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumour-derived cell lines. The cytotoxicity of a class of novel gold-phosphine complexes with antibacterial activity was assessed against the CHO cell line in order to select compounds with a favourable in vitro therapeutic index. The VERO cell line was used to assess the cytotoxicity of a number of AgCl/TiO2 compositions with antibacterial activity as part of a biomaterials programme designed to produce materials Suitable for incorporation into medical devices.

This has taken the form of many different assessment criteria, some even attempting some form of 'quantitative' grading index. With the complexity of this response and the availability of high performance computer systems it is not sufficient and no longer necessary to describe a tissue response subjectively. The soft tissue response to a number of implanted materials has been analysed using a combination of immunohistochemistry and image analysis to reproducibly stain and count the cells involved in a soft tissue response to implanted materials, as well as measure their position relative to the implanted material. The combination of cell count and pattern of cell distribution revealed that although the magnitude of the cellular responses changes with respect to time the position of cells with respect to an implanted material does not change significantly over time.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether phagocytosable particles of hydroxyapatite had an adverse effect on bone ingrowth. Bone harvest chambers were implanted bilaterally in the proximal tibial metaphyses of 13 mature rabbits. The bone harvest chamber has a transverse 1-mm wide pore, providing a continuous canal through the chamber for tissue ingrowth. After an initial 6-week period for osseointegration of the bone harvest chambers, the contents of the canal were harvested at 3- or 6-week intervals. Hydroxyapatite particles (diameter, 5 mu) were mixed with a carrier solution, 1% sodium hyaluronate, and implanted in the canal of one chamber in each animal. The contralateral chamber was implanted with the carrier only and served as a control. Histological sections from the tissue harvested from the chambers were evaluated by light microscopy and histomorphometry, and the area of bone ingrowth was measured as a percentage of total area in each section. At 3 weeks there was more bone in the hydroxyapatite sections than in controls; at 6 weeks there was no difference. Hydroxypapatite particles were incorporated within the matrix of new ingrown bone at both time periods. There was no evidence of granuloma formation or inflammation. Previous studies have shown that particles of high density polyethylene and bone cement adversely affect bone ingrowth in this model. The present results suggest that hydroxyapatite particles, small enough to be phagocytosed by macrophages, did not have such effects.",,"WANG, JS (reprint author), UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT ORTHOPED,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,31,36,37,0,0,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

The purpose of this study was to correlate the size and the orientation of image disturbances observed on specific samples of dental materials with their magnetic susceptibility. The measurement of the magnetic susceptibility was performed in the 10(-5) or 10(-6) range using MRI to establish a classification of dental materials. Methods. Cylindrical dental alloy samples incorporating gold, silver, and palladium were placed in a Pyrex beaker filled with distilled water. Images were performed at 0.13 Tesla using two-dimensional Fourier transformation and projection reconstruction at 360 degrees imaging methods. The magnetic susceptibilities were obtained by measuring distances between spots having the highest intensity on the image. Results. Avery discriminating classification may be established on MRI criteria. This method permits one to determine the dia- or para-magnetic character of the dental materials tested. Only palladium-based alloys have been detected to be paramagnetic with kappa > 0. One of the silver-based alloys did not induce detectable distortion because its susceptibility was very close to that of distilled water. Based on this MRI data, the use of this material may be recommended for applications that may be subjected to MRI evaluation. Significance. With the increasing use of MRI as a diagnostic tool, it is useful to establish a classification of prosthetic biomaterials compatible with MRI.","UNIV LYON 1,LAB RMN,F-69372 LYON 08,FRANCE","BEUF, O (reprint author), UNIV LYON 1,FAC ODONTOL,ETUD SURFACES & INTERFACES ODONTOL LAB,RUE GUILLAUME PARADIN,F-69372 LYON 08,FRANCE.",,"BEUF, Olivier/H-6966-2014",,,,,11,17,18,2,2,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

Antibody-treated platelets were added to microtiter wells coated with fibronectin, fibrinogen, vWF, IgG, vitronectin, albumin, or platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Cr-51-labeled platelet adhesion to matrix proteins was expressed as a percentage of that measured on PPP-coated surface. Platelets adhered to fibrinogen, fibronectin, vWF, or IgG immobilized on polystyrene. Limited binding to either vitronectin or albumin was detected. Binding to fibrinogen and IgG was blocked by mAb 10E5. Binding to IgG was also blocked by mAb IV.3. Binding to fibronectin, reduced in the presence of mAb 10E5, mAb BIIG4, or the polyclonal antiserum A108 alone, was further reduced by combined 10E5 and BIIG4 or 10E5 and A108. Neither mAb 10E5 nor 6D1 alone blocked adhesion to vWF; however, the combination of 10E5 and 6D1 significantly reduced platelet adhesion to this matrix, Finally, platelet adhesion to the plasma-coated surface was reduced by mAbs 10E5 and BIIG4. These results indicate that multiple adhesion receptors can mediate platelet adhesion to matrix proteins immobilized on surfaces.

New hard tissue is formed directly on the hydroxyapatite, whereas a characteristic necrotic area appears under Ca(OH)(2). The differing pulpal reactions to these two capping agents suggest differing cell responses. After isolation and selection of human pulp fibroblasts in vitro, the cells were characterized by their morphology, their high alkaline phosphatase specific activity, and their synthesis of type I and III collagens and fibronectin. They were then incubated in the presence of either hydroxyapatite (1 mg/ml) or Ca(OH)(2) (0.8 mg/ml). With Ca(OH)(2), the cells exhibited dramatical alterations in morphology, DNA synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity and protein synthesis, in accordance with the necrosis observed in vivo. With hydroxyapatite, phagocytic activity of pulpal fibroblasts toward hydroxyapatite particles (<10 mu m) was seen. As a consequence, DNA synthesis was affected. This inhibitory effect was not due to cell damage, as demonstrated by increased [H-3]-proline and [H-3]-leucine incorporation by the cells. There was also an inhibitory effect of hydroxyapatite on alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that the pulp fibroblasts were not in a differentiation stage. In conclusion, compared to the effects of Ca(OH)(2) on human pulp fibroblasts, these data are consistent with the biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite previously described in vivo and testify to the occurrence of a biological response elicited by this synthetic biomaterial.","INST BIOL,INSERM,CJF 9011,F-44035 NANTES,FRANCE","ALLIOTLICHT, B (reprint author), FAC CHIRURG DENT,PL A RICORDEAU,F-44035 NANTES,FRANCE.",,"GREGOIRE, Marc/G-2867-2013","GREGOIRE, Marc/0000-0003-3868-0198",,,,48,25,29,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0003-9969,,,ARCH ORAL BIOL,Arch.

All of these surfaces were covered with their respective oxides formed upon exposure of the metals to air. Quantitative analysis of the number of cells bound per unit area indicates that S. epidermidis (RP12) exhibits greatest adhesion to pure V surfaces. When exposed to surfaces having controlled spatial variations in chemical composition on the 10 mu m scale (microfabricated samples), the bacteria preferentially populate V islands versus Ti or Al substrata. In the case of the biphasic Ti6Al4V alloy, the bacteria tend to adhere to V-rich, mixed phase regions and phase boundaries.

The respective biomaterials were positioned in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber, and exposed to flowing blood for 5 min at wall shear rates characteristic for veins (100/s), medium sized (650/s) and moderately stenosed arteries (2600/s). Blood-material interactions were morphologically quantified as platelet-surface adhesion, thrombus volume and fibrin deposition. Platelet adhesion to Dacron was highest at the lowest shear rate (13%) and decreased with increasing shear (4% at 2600/s). In contrast, platelet adhesion to PTFE was shear rate independent (17-19%), and significantly higher than the adhesion to Dacron at 2600/s (P< 0.05). A hallmark of the platelets adherent to PTFE and Dacron was the large percentage of platelets not spread out on the surface. This indicates that both materials were poor platelet activators, even though immunostaining demonstrated the adsorption of the platelet adhesive proteins von Willebrand factor and fibronectin. Adsorption of fibrinogen was also prevailing on both materials. Virtually no thrombi formed on Dacron, while a few small platelet thrombi were observed on PTFE. Less than 1 % of the Dacron and PTFE surfaces were covered by fibrin, irrespective of the shear rate. Thus, Dacron and PTFE interact differently with flowing non-anticoagulated human blood, and Dacron is apparently the least thrombogenic material.","NYCOMED BIOREG AS,UNIV OSLO,N-0317 OSLO,NORWAY",,,,,,,,31,32,36,1,6,RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH",0957-5235,,,BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN,Blood Coagul.

One of the potential difficulties with absorbable implants is the possible toxicity of the polymeric degradation products especially if they accumulate and become concentrated. Accordingly, material evaluation must involve dose-response toxicity data as well as mechanical properties and degradation rates. In this study the toxicity and rates of degradation for six polymers were determined, along with the toxicity of their degradation product components. The polymers studied were poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), two samples of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) having different molecular weights, poly(ortho ester) (POE), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(hydroxy butyrate valerate) (5% valerate) (PHBV). Polymeric specimens were incubated at 37-degrees-C in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 37-degrees-C) and sterile deionized water. The solutions were not changed during the incubation intervals, providing a worst-case model of the effects of accumulation of degradation products. The pH and acute toxicity of the incubation solutions and the mass loss and logarithmic viscosity number of the polymer samples were measured at 10 days, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Toxicity was measured using a bioluminescent bacteria, acute toxicity assay system. The acute toxicity of pure PGA, PLA, POE, and PCL degradation product components was also determined. Degradation products for PHBV were not tested. PGA incubation solutions were toxic at 10 days and at all following intervals. The lower molecular weight PLA incubation solutions were not toxic in buffer but were toxic by 4 weeks in water. The other materials did not produce toxic responses during the 16-week exposures. The degradation products components in order from most toxic to least toxic are: lactic acid (PLA), epsilon-caproic acid (PCL), glycolic acid (PGA), cyclohexane dimethanol (POE), propionic acid (POE), 1,6 hexane diol (POE), pentaerythritol dipropionate (POE), and pentaerythritol (POE).

Albumin molecules were functionalized by introducing double bonds using glycidyl acrylate. The functionalized albumin was covalently attached to various biomaterial surfaces such as polypropylene, polycarbonate, and poly(vinyl chloride) by gamma-irradiation. Surface-induced platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on the albumin-grafted surfaces was examined using computer-enhanced video microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The amount of the grafted albumin was dependent on the gamma-irradiation dose and the concentration of albumin used for adsorption. The grafted albumin molecules remained on the surface even after exposure to blood for prolonged time periods. This approach was used to graft albumin to polymeric materials of an oxygenator. The albumin grafting resulted in a substantial improvement in blood compatibility as compared to control oxygenators. The covalent grafting of functionalized albumin by gamma-irradiation obviates the need for premodification of chemically inert polymer surfaces. It is useful for albumin grafting to various biomaterial surfaces.

In vitro friction tests showed that the coefficient of dynamic friction of the lubricated surface was about 0.01 against rabbit bladder and the coefficient of static friction increased with the preload period. The efficacy of a lubricated cystoscope was evaluated by an in vivo test simulating cystoscope operation. The maximal and the total resistance force on the cystoscope model were found to decrease with the surface lubrication.

A four-step detergent and enzymatic extraction process has been developed to remove cellular components from bovine pericardial tissue. The process results in an acellular matrix material consisting primarily of elastin, insoluble collagen, and tightly bound glycosaminoglycans. Light and electron microscopy confirmed that nearly all cellular constituents are removed without ultrastructural evidence of damage to fibrous components. Collagen denaturation temperatures remained unaltered. Biochemical analysis confirmed the retention of collagen and elastin and some differential extraction of glycosaminoglycans. Low strain rate fracture testing and high strain rate viscoelastic characterization showed that, with the exception of slightly increased stress relaxation, the mechanical properties of the fresh tissue were preserved in the pericardial acellular matrix. Crosslinking of the material in glutaraldehyde or poly(glycidyl ether) produced mechanical changes consistent with the same treatments of fresh tissue. The pericardial acellular matrix is a promising approach to the production of biomaterials for heart valve or cardiovascular patching applications.

In the first step the films were made hydrophobic by exposure to a tetrafluoromethane plasma. In the second step hydrophilicity was gradually increased by exposure to an argon plasma. XPS analysis of these films demonstrated that the first step resulted in the incorporation of fluor into the film surface (approximately 50 At.-%). In the second step fluor was almost completely removed from the surface, while the surface oxygen concentration increased from 5 to 20 At.-%. The wettability of the modified films, as characterized by water contact angle measurements, increased as a function of the argon treatment time. The advancing/receding contact angles (Wilhelmy plate method) decreased from 128/83 to 50/2 degrees respectively. In vitro adhesion of granulocytes and lymphocytes to the modified surfaces was studied under static conditions as a function of time. For both types of leukocytes it was found that the number of cells which adhered to the surface within a certain incubation time increased when the surface became more hydrophilic. The number of adherent granulocytes was about 2-3 times higher than the number of adherent lymphocytes. The number of adherent cells which could be predicted from the relationship between leukocyte adhesion and the wettability of the substrates within the series of homologous surfaces corresponded with the number of adherent cells to control surfaces (untreated polyurethane and Teflon).

Stabilization of collagen was performed with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde at acid pH, in the absence or presence of 0.7 M NaCl to control collagen swelling. For each condition, some samples were further treated at neutral pH. These test samples were compared with samples treated with glutaraldehyde at neutral pH and with samples of Omni-flow vascular prosthesis. The effectiveness of the stabilization was examined by amino acid analysis, to assess the extent of modification, isometric tension analysis, to evaluate the extent of crosslinking, compliance and accelerated fatigue testing, to evaluate mechanical properties, and by a rat subcutaneous model to evaluate tissue response and propensity to calcification. The data indicated that effective crosslinking could be achieved at low pH and that this can be increased slightly by the presence of NaCl. At low pH, the extent of calcification was low compared to samples treated at pH 7. Subsequent treatment at pH 7 of samples given an initial low pH glutaraldehyde (GA) treatment generally did not alter shrinkage temperatures although the extent of lysine modification and calcification did increase. In general, a more inflammatory response was observed in samples tanned at low pH, although this was not as severe as responses to untreated tissue implants. The Omniflow vascular prosthesis showed excellent chemical and mechanical properties and did not show any calcification.","UNIV MELBOURNE,SCH DENT SCI,PARKVILLE,VIC 3052,AUSTRALIA","CASAGRANDA, F (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,343 ROYAL PARADE,PARKVILLE,VIC 3052,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,11,11,11,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

To visualize the cell layer on opaque surfaces, a fluorescent staining method has been developed. The measurements show statistically significant differences between material classes, with the highest degree of adhesion about twice that of the lowest degree of adhesion. The greatest adhesion was observed with metallic materials which exhibit a shear stress to erode cells from the material surface of about 5.65 x 10(-3) N cm(-2). The tensile stress of adhesion (about 2.15 x 10(-2) N cm(-2)) was similar for most materials.

Current advances in biotechnology have opened the way for the development of a biological artificial liver, which is called the hybrid artificial liver because it consists of both biological and artificial materials. Isolated hepatocytes have been investigated for use in various types of hybrid artificial liver. In addition, the role of biomatrices, microcarriers, and the microencapsulation technique has been studied with respect to long-term maintenance of hepatocellular function and development of high-density culture systems for hepatocytes.

The beta-sheet structure is stable at very low concentrations in water and at high temperatures. Various pH changes at 1.5, 3, 7, and 11 had little effect on the stability of the beta-sheet structure. The beta-sheet structure was not altered significantly even in the presence of 0.1% SDS, 7 molar guanidine hydrochloride, or 8 molar urea. One of the structural characteristics of the EAK16 is its ionic self-complementarity in that ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds between Glu and Lys can form readily between two oligopeptide beta-sheet structures. This structural feature is probably one of the factors that promotes its extreme stability. This is the first example of such an extended ionic self-complementarity in a protein structure. EAK16 and its related peptides may have applications as useful biomaterials. It also offers a good model for studying the mechanism of beta-sheet formation. Because the oligopeptide can self-assemble to form a membranous structure, it may have relevance to origin of life research.

The studies reported here used several materials (thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers) as the challenging agent, to demonstrate whether polymers, chemically different from each other, could differentially activate macrophages to carry out their proinflammatory role more effectively. The materials tested included: poly(etherurethane ureas) (PEUU A'), poly(etherurethane ureas) with a surface active additive, Methacrol(R), (PEUU C'), polymethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyetherimide, (PEI), and polyetheretherketone, (PEEK). For all the tested materials, the maximum numbers of exudate cells and of Ia-positive macrophages were found on day 7, although the entity of the cell increase was associated with the material used for the implant. Similarly, the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages varied according to the specific polymer present in the cages after 7 days. By day 14 the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages decreased with individual exudates showing 19-32% Ia-positive cells depending on the different type of material. Only in the case of PDMS did the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages remain the same as compared with control empty cage macrophages.

This study investigated the role of the host protein fibronectin in promoting adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis to metallic surfaces representing materials used for orthopaedic devices. Pure human fibronectin was adsorbed in vitro onto coverslips (0.8 x 0.8 cm) of stainless steel, pure titanium, or titanium-aluminum-niobium alloy. In vitro bacterial adhesion was promoted more strongly by the metallic surfaces coated with fibronectin than by albumin-coated controls for two strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis. Furthermore, with the fibronectin-coated coverslips, bacterial adhesion to titanium alloy was significantly greater than adhesion to stainless steel. Adhesion of the three staphylococcal strains was promoted more strongly by coverslips explanted from the subcutaneous space of guinea pins and tested under similar conditions than by albumin-coated controls. Incubation of either in vitro fibronectin-coated or explanted metallic coverslips with anti-fibronectin antibodies produced a significant decrease in staphylococcal adhesion. These results suggest that the presence of fibronectin on the surface of implanted metallic devices is an important determinant of colonization of orthopaedic biomaterials by staphylococci.","UNIV HOSP GENEVA,DEPT MED,DIV INFECT DIS,CH-1211 GENEVA 14,SWITZERLAND; UNIV HOSP GENEVA,DEPT SURG,ORTHOPAED CLIN,GENEVA,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,22,49,49,0,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

On both sides of the implant, at the same distance, two screws were placed to allow further determination of the position of the implant. The PIXE method is particularly suitable here because of the possibility to analyze directly the samples without any preparation and to choose easily the dimensions of beam used for the gradient study. The X-rays have been detected with an ultra LEGe instead of the usual Si(Li) device to avoid the Si escape peak associated with the K(alpha) X-ray of calcium, the major constituent of bone.

Experimental procedures examined microscopically on extracted teeth can include the cutting of the hard tissues, observation of fluid flow in dentine, the application of adhesives, and the fracturing of adhesive interfaces under load. Undertaking experiments where time is an important function has improved our knowledge of many of the materials/substrate interactions involved in dental operative procedures.

The high manufacturing rate of such threads permits the production of collagen fabrics of various configurations. The fiber diameter can be controlled, and threads with dry diameters as low as 25 mu m have been produced. Braids and bundles of collagen threads implanted as a replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament in a dog model were completely remodeled into host tissue by 12 weeks.

By combining photolithographic and silane coupling techniques, glass coverslips were patterned with either n-octadecyldimethylchlorosilane (ODDMS) or dimethyldichlorosilane (DMS), and N-(2-aminoethyl)3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (EDS). The alkylsilanes, theoretically, have similar methyl and methylene groups exposed at the surface but different structures, with DMS being amorphous and ODDMS ordered. Neuroblastoma cells, osteosarcoma cells, and fibroblasts plated on surfaces patterned with EDS/ODDMS and EDS/DMS specifically localized on the EDS regions, but distributed randomly on ODDMS/DMS patterned surfaces. The preferential assembly of cells onto EDS regions did not depend on the structure of the adjacent alkylsilane regions and was a time-dependent process. Angle-dependent x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements indicated that EDS was immobilized on glass as a fractional hydrophilic monolayer, and ODDMS and DMS were bound as patchy amorphous hydrophobic multilayers. Neither surface coverage nor thickness of the overlayer seemed to be as important as surface chemistry, or charge, in guiding mammalian cell distribution. These results are consistent with the concept that mammalian cells attach to and are guided by positively charged surfaces.

The results indicate that early after implantation both ENDSC and HDSC functioned well as a matrix for cellular ingrowth. However during further implantation HDSC soon degraded resulting in herniations, while ENDSC showed a delay in the degradation time of at least 20 weeks. ENDSC thereby enabled collagen new-formation and functioned as a guidance for muscle overgrowth.

In this work, the adsorption of plasminogen to silylated silica glass materials has been investigated with the objective of providing data for the development of a profibrinolytic or clot lysing surface for blood-contacting applications. The adsorption of plasminogen from Tris buffer to silica glass, lysine modified silica glass, and its sulfonated silica glass precursor has been investigated. The isotherms (25-degrees-C) suggest high affinity, Langmuir type adsorption. Adsorption capacities are in the order sulfonated silica > lysinized silica > unmodified silica. Estimates of the apparent affinity constants based on the Langmuir equation indicate that the affinity of plasminogen is greater for the lysinized surface than for either the silica glass or sulfonated silica glass. Experiments on the adsorption of plasminogen to the sulfonated and lysinized silica glass in the presence of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), known to interfere with plasminogen binding to lysine, were also carried out. Adsorption plateau values for the sulfonated surface with and without EACA in the buffer were the same. For the lysinized surface, adsorption was reduced in the presence of EACA. Desorption experiments against Tris buffer showed that for the lysinized and sulfonated surfaces, 70-80% of the protein was irreversibly bound, with slightly higher reversibility on the lysinized surface. It is concluded that the mechanisms of adsorption of plasminogen to the lysinized surface and sulfonated surface are different, and that the lysine binding sites of plasminogen may be utilized in its interactions with the lysinized surface.

Light of visible blue wavelengths, 400-500 nm, has been applied at normal angles to 0.2-5.0 mm sections of human dentine and representative ceramic, polymer-ceramic composites and hybrid glass-.polyalkenoate materials. The integrated optical transmission has been determined for each material section. The data have been converted to absorbance values and analysed to check for mathematical conformity to the Beer-Lambert Law. It is found that conformity (typically, P < 0.01) to the linear Beer-Lambert Law is only attained by making a substantial correction for the intensity of light reflected from the surface of aesthetic biomaterials. This is otherwise expressed by distinguishing between true and apparent absorbance. From linear regression of apparent absorbance with section thickness, the intercept depends upon the logarithm of the surface-reflection ratio. This factor ranges from 30% to 90% in the materials investigated. It follows that there is a high degree of inefficency in the transmission of visible light into and through aesthetic biomaterials for the purposes of photoactivation using existing technology. Means by which this limitation and inefficiency may be reduced are discussed.

The silicone-containing elastomers studied included two thermoset amorphous silica reinforced dimethyl methylvinyl siloxane-based polymers which were extruded as Silastic(R) RX-50 Medical Grade Tubing (RX-50) and Silastic(R) Medical Grade Tubing H.P.

The RX-50 tubing material showed less thrombus deposition compared to the silicone-urea urethane copolymers. This suggests that the blood-contacting response of a silicone elastomer is strongly affected by the incorporation of the urea urethane segments. Among the silicone-urea urethane copolymers, the SP-3 material showed higher levels of platelet and fibrinogen deposition than the SP-1 and SP-2 materials, whereas the SP-1 and SP-2 samples had similar levels of deposition. These results indicate that the blood-contacting properties of the silicone-urea urethane copolymers were influenced more by the molecular weight of the polydimethylsiloxane than by the type of diol used in the urea urethane segments. The maximal platelet deposition on the poly(vinyl alcohol)-coated silicone was approximately an order of magnitude greater than those on the silicone-containing elastomers indicating that the PVA coating was more thrombogenic.","UNIV DELAWARE,COLL ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; DOW CORNING CORP,MIDLAND,MI 48686; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,"Lin, Jui-Che/C-8230-2012","Lin, Jui-Che/0000-0003-4436-655X",,,,16,0,0,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

GENERAL HEALING RESPONSE,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"For biocompatibility evaluation, orthopaedic and dental biomaterials are often implanted into bone after drilling. Bone repair in the drilled hole may be affected by bone damage attributed to drilling, thus influencing the bone response to biomaterials. The drilling parameters (the speed of rotation and irrigation) were investigated histologically. Three holes were drilled in each rabbit tibia with different conditions; three speeds (200, 500 and 5000 r.p.m.) and the use of central irrigation or not. Rabbits were killed immediately, 3 days, 2 weeks or 4 weeks post-operatively. India ink was injected in several rabbits just after drilling to investigate the extent of local ischaemia. The drilling quality was evaluated with regard to hole geometry, initial thermal damage and later bone healing process. For 500 or 200 r.p.m. the initial thermal damage, shown by the degree of ischaemia, was less than for 5000 r.p.m. drilling, but the hole edge was not always cleanly cut. This uneven cut edge was considered not to influence the bone-healing process. Drilling at 200 r.p.m. introduced a lower degree of circularity. The subsequent bone formation was retarded by 5000 r.p.m. drilling, presumably due to thermal damage and vascular obstructions, The irrigation was effective in reducing the ischaemic area. These results suggest that a speed of about 500 r.p.m. may be recommendable for intraosseous implantation of biomaterials. The central irrigation system is considered effective in reducing the ischaemic area.","UNIV PARIS 07,FAC MED LARIBOISIERE ST LOUIS,CNRS,UA 1432,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","OHASHI, H (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,10,10,0,6,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

THE INFLUENCE OF DRILLING SITE,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"For orthopaedic biomaterial implantation testing, specimens are often implanted into cortical bone defects. The implantation site is assumed to be one of the factors that influence the bone response to biomaterials. The aim of this study was to investigate the bone-healing process in drilled cortical defects at different sites with respect to time. Sheep metatarsus was implemented, since it is a long straight bone with four flat faces. Thus, the different drilling sites were obtained by changing the longitudinal level (proximal, middle and distal) and bone aspect (anterior, lateral and posterior). Metatarsi were obtained at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months post-operatively and with non-decalcified sections the newly formed bone area was measured using a microscope connected to an image analyser. The rate of bone formation was higher in the anterior aspect (P < 0.05). The new bone did not form concentrically from the hole edge towards the centre, and the principal direction of bone growth was different between the anterior and the posterior aspects (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference with respect to the longitudinal axis. These results indicate that the implantation site must be considered when analysing the bone response to biomaterials implanted in cortical defects.","UNIV PARIS 07,FAC MED LARIBOISIERE ST LOUIS,CNRS,UA 1432,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","OHASHI, H (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,8,1,1,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

In this study, the contact system, in which the activation of factor XII and plasma kallikrein is included, is highlighted. This article describes a simple chromogenic assay to determine the Hageman Factor fragment (HFf, or factor XIIf) and kallikrein activity invitro. The assay is based on conversion of Z-Lys-Phe-Arg-pNA.2HCl to which human factor XIIf and kallikrein appeared to have a high affinity. To discriminate between the serine proteases factor XIIf and kallikrein to cleave this substrate, aprotinin was added to one of two complementary samples. In this in vitro study, standardized disks from glass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polytetrafluoro ethylene (PTFE), and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) were studied for their capacity to generate factor XIIf and kallikrein in plasma. Kaolin was used as positive control. On glass disks the highest and on HDPE the lowest generation of factor XIIf and kallikrein were found, both with a ratio of 1:1. On PDMS and on PTFE disks protease activities were intermediate, but with a factor XIIf and kallikrein activity ratio of 1:2 and 1:4, respectively. Apparently because of the hydrophobic surface character of PDMS and PTFE, these surfaces absorb or fail to produce the factor XIIf. This assay appeared to be discriminative even for materials that are considered mild activators of the contact system and can therefore be used asa standard method to qualify biomaterials. NOTE: Factor XIIf (mel wt. 28,000) is designated in the literature as HFf, beta-factor XIIa, or factor XII(LMW) and factor XIIa (mel wt. 80,000) as HFa; factor XIIa(HMW) or alpha-factor XIIa. To avoid the unfashionable use of beta-factor XIIa or alpha-factor XIIa, we chose in this study the use of factor XIIf and factor XIIa, according to the article by R. A.

In vitro, the four DSC versions were found to be noncytotoxic or very low in cytoxicity. After subcutaneous implantation in rats, hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked DSC (HDSC) seldom induced an increased infiltration of neutrophils or macrophages, as compared with normal wound healing; whereas new formation of collagen was observed. DSC crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GDSC) followed by reaction with NaBH4 shortly after implantation showed an increased infiltration of neutrophils with a deviant morphology. Furthermore, a high incidence of calcification was observed, which may explain the minor ingrowth of giant cells and fibroblasts, and the poor formation of new rat collagen. Acyl azide-crosslinked DSC (AaDSC) first induced an increased infiltration of macrophages, and then of giant cells, both with high lipid formation. AaDSC degraded at least twice as slowly as HDSC and GDSC, finally leaving a matrix of newly formed rat collagen. Samples crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (ENDSC) induced the same mild cellular reaction as HDSC; whereas, similar to AaDSC, the degradation rate was slow and an-optimal rat collagen matrix was formed. Of the crosslinked DSC samples, ENDSC seems most promising for tissue regeneration.

White New Zealand rabbits received intraperitoneal implants of different biomaterials for repair of defects created on the abdominal wall. The following biomaterials were used: polypropylene, polyester, expanded polytetraflueroethylene, polypropylene mesh/polypropylene sheeting (polypropylene mesh covered with polypropylene sheeting on the peritoneal side), polypropylene/silastic, polypropylene/polyglactin, polypropylene/polyglycolic acid, and polypropylene/fibrin. All biomaterials evaluated caused adhesions to the intestines except for polypropylene mesh/polypropylene sheeting and polypropylene mesh/silastic composites. Because adhesion of the intestine to the biomaterial is the first stage of biomaterial-related intestinal fistula, its prevention is logical for the elimination of this complication. Composites with the selective property of adhering to the abdominal wall, yet sparing the viscera, would facilitate thoracic and abdominal wall surgeries, as well as intraperitoneal laparoscopic hernioplasties.

Because neutrophils mediate host defense against infection, the effect of biomaterials on neutrophil superoxide release and the mechanism of that effect were investigated using three materials commonly employed in surgical practice. The graft materials were expanded polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyurethane and woven dacron. Polystyrene, a commonly used laboratory support vessel, was also studied. Both polystyrene and polyurethane were activating, but serum inhibitable, whereas PTFE was nonactivating, and woven dacron was not activating unless serum was present. The signaling mechanisms used by these materials demonstrated time and material dependency. Pertussis toxin inhibition of G protein-dependent activation had little or no effect on biomaterial induced activation, whereas FMLP-induced activation of the same biomaterial-associated cells was inhibited. Protein kinase C inhibition with staurosporine greatly inhibited polystyrene-induced activation, but had only a partial effect with polyurethane and even less effect with the activation associated with serum-treated woven dacron. These studies demonstrated that biomaterial contact-induced neutrophil activation differed from that described for cells in suspension, and showed that activation mechanisms on one material cannot be extrapolated to mechanisms on other materials.

The ion chemistry of macrolides, as determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), is different for ions produced as metallated than those formed as (M + H)+ species. An explanation for these differences is the location of the charge. For protonated species, the charge is most likely situated on a functional group with high proton affinity, such as the dimethylamino group of the amino sugar. The alkali metal ion, however, is bonded to the highly oxygenated aglycone. As a result, the collision-activated dissociation spectra of protonated macrolides are simple with readily identifiable fragment ions in both the high and low mass regions but no fragments in the middle mass range. In contrast, the cationized species give complex spectra with many abundant ions, most of which are located in the high mass range. The complementary nature of the fragmentation of these two species recommends the study of both by MS/MS when determining the structure or confirming the identity of these biomaterials.","UNIV NEBRASKA,MIDWEST CTR MASS SPECT,LINCOLN,NE 68588; SCHERING PLOUGH RES INST,KENILWORTH,NJ",,,,"MacMillan, Denise/0000-0002-8424-6651",,,,46,18,18,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",1044-0305,,,J AM SOC MASS SPECTR,J.

However, wider use has been limited in good part by economic factors, some of which are related to the line-of-sight nature of the beam implantation process. Plasma source implantation (or plasma immersion ion implantation) is intended to remove some of the limitations imposed by directionality of beam systems and also to help provide economies of scale. The present paper will outline relevant technologies and areas of expertise that exist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in relation to possible future needs in materials processing. Experience in generation of plasmas, control of ionization states, pulsed extraction, and sheath physics exist. Contributions to future technology can be made either for the immersion mode or for the extracted beam mode. Existing facilities include the High Power Test Facility, which could conservatively operate at 1 A of continuous current at 100 kV delivered to areas of about 1 m2. Higher instantaneous voltages and currents are available with a reduced duty cycle. Another facility, the High Heat Flux Facility can supply a maximum at 60 kV and currents of up to 60 A for 2 s on a 10% duty cycle. Plasmas may be generated by use of microwaves, radio-frequency induction, or other methods and plasma properties may be tailored to suit specific needs.

In both cases, sensitive and, even more important, selective analytical tools for the determination of individual components are mandatory. However, investigation of complex and often diffuse (bio)chemical systems requires a different analytical approach aimed at the detection of a wide range of compounds rather than a selective analysis of compounds. This requirement is especially true if no prior knowledge exists of the kind of compounds involved in the properties of such systems. The analysis of macromolecular systems or complex matrices consisting of chemical components with strongly diverging physico-chemical properties can often hardly be performed through separation and determination of individual components. Examples of such matrices are bioreactor mixtures, microorganisms, cells of biological origin, body fluids, plant tissues, raw materials for food production, food products, dietary fiber, soil, humic substances, and fossil deposits (1-5). Especially the macromolecular part of such samples contains compounds that are highly involatile, with molecular weights far beyond the mass range of mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometry requires ions in vacuum. This process involves formation of ions from volatile compounds (generally El and Cl processes, or desorption of ions into the gas phase, for example by field desorption (FD) (6, 7) or charged aerosol droplets (thermospray, electrospray, ion spray) for nonvolatile compounds (8). Compounds of medium volatility and relatively high thermostability, usually in the medium molecular weight range, can be analyzed with thermal desorption techniques, such as direct probe mass spectrometry (DP-MS) (3). Apparently, these techniques are not appropriate for direct mass spectrometric analyses of the intact high-molecular-weight and heat-labile compounds of the complex matrices described above. For such samples, thermal degradation techniques (pyrolysis) can be performed to generate more volatile compounds of lower molecular weight that are amenable to mass spectrometric analysis (analytical pyrolysis). Therefore, many analytical profiling methods of (bio)macromolecular matrices are based on analysis of thermally-degraded matrices. Generally, application of such degradation techniques results in mixtures of high complexity. Therefore, advanced analytical equipment is needed to analyze the mixtures generated. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) (4, 9-12), pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC), and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) (5, 13, 14) are the techniques most widely applied in the field of analytical pyrolysis. They offer a powerful approach in that a great variety of compounds can be measured in one analysis and usually limited sample preparations are required. Generally, only small amounts of sample (typically 10-200 mug) are needed (1-5). Important applications are fingerprinting for characterization and differentiation of polymers, biomaterials, and microorganisms using pattern recognition methods (4, 5, 15), and identification of individual compounds in pyrolysates for obtaining insight into the structure of the original (bio)macromolecules (3, 4, 16-18). In the fingerprinting approach, differentiation is frequently based on statistical evaluation rather than on chemical interpretation of differentiating components (15). However, in most applications of this kind, at least global indications are obtained of relevant chemical compounds on which differentiation is based. Comparison of the techniques most widely used in analyses of this type, Py-GC and Py-MS, shows that dedicated Py-MS equipment offers a number of potential advantages (4, 9, 19), such as a high sample throughput, the potential of handling compounds differing to a large extent in polarity and molecular weight (4, 12), the suitability of MS data to computer handling for data analyses, good reproducibility, and a better long-term stability. However, for the identification of a large number of individual compounds in pyrolysates, for example, extended series of isomeric or homologous compounds, Py-GC/MS (5), Py-GC/(HR)MS (14, 17), and Py-GC/MSMS (20) are the techniques of choice, as long as volatile compounds are encountered. Serious limitations are the condensation of nonvolatile, relatively high-molecular-weight, and polar compounds on the inner wall of the glass linear and column and the relatively long analysis times. Recent developments in pyrolysate analysis embrace the application of tandem mass spectrometry (Py-MSMS) (18, 21-25), Py-GC/MSMS (20), and (off-line Py) fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry (FAB/MSMS) (11). Py-MSMS is a powerful method for identifying molecular species directly in pyrolysates and has successfully been applied to the characterization of thermal decomposition products of polymers (21, 23), biopolymers (18, 24), bacteria (22), and algae (25). It is interesting to note that some recent reports show an apparent tendency to characterization of microorganisms using only well-defined chemical marker components (26, 27). The application of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical chromatography (SFC) to high-molecular-weight and polar compounds from pyrolysates has been reported recently (28, 29). In general, the approach requires off-line pyrolysis and pyrolysate derivatization preceding HPLC or SFC separation (29), but some initial results of on-line pyrolysis under SFC conditions with subsequent SFC analysis (Py-SFC) have been reported (28). Especially in SFC analysis of polar compounds, derivatization is required to reduce the polarity (30). Also, the direct monitoring of volatile compounds becomes increasingly important. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS), applying hollow-fiber capillary membranes or membrane sheets, in combination with (tandem) mass spectrometry has recently been developed for the monitoring of mixtures of relatively volatile organic compounds in aqueous solutions, for gas analysis, and for in vivo studies of the formation of low-molecular-weight compounds. These techniques are applied to monitor small molecules in fermentation broths (fermentor control), to study microbial physiology, and for in vivo analysis of blood gases (31, 32). Flow injection/membrane introduction devices have been applied to bioreactor monitoring (33). Because data acquired from (bio)chemical matrices are mostly very complex, data analysis techniques are necessary for an effective evaluation of the analytical output. Already in an early stage of direct mixture analysis, in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the first applications of data preprocessing and pattern recognition techniques were mentioned (4, 34). Data analysis techniques will be discussed in another section of this review. In this article, we will selectively review the use of direct mass spectrometric profiling for the analysis of complex (bio)chemical systems with an emphasis on applications in which pattern recognition techniques have been applied to the evaluation of the resulting profiles. Application of chromatographic separation techniques to mixture analysis is mentioned only occasionally in this review. The direct analysis of polymers by mass spectrometry has been reviewed separately in this journal (3) and, therefore, will not be discussed in this article.",,"TAS, AC (reprint author), TNO,NUTR & FOOD RES INST,POB 360,ZEIST,NETHERLANDS.",,"feng, andrew/F-8487-2014",,,,,148,10,10,3,51,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0277-7037,,,MASS SPECTROM REV,Mass Spectrom.

By applying this correction, we determine a set of values for stress-time which, when compared with those obtained with a non-sutured sample, reveal a significant fall in this ratio and, thus, a decrease in the durability.

In this study the contribution that serum fibronectin (Fn) or vitronectin (Vn) make to the attachment and spreading of cells cultured from explanted human bone (bone-derived cells) during the first 90 min of culture was determined for metallic and ceramic surfaces. The requirement for Fn or Vn for attachment and spreading of bone-derived cells onto stainless steel 316 (SS), titanium (Ti) and alumina (Al2O3) and to polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) was directly tested by selective removal of Fn or Vn from the serum prior to addition to the culture medium. Attachment and spreading of bone-derived cells onto SS, Ti and Al2O3 surfaces were reduced by 73-83% when the cells were seeded in medium containing serum from which the Vn had been removed. Cell attachment and spreading on these surfaces when seeded in medium containing Fn-depleted serum (which contained Vn) were not reduced to the same extent as in the medium containing Vn-depleted serum. The bone-derived cells failed to attach to the surfaces to the same extent when seeded in medium containing serum depleted of both Vn and Fn. Our results show that for human bone-derived cells, the attachment and spreading of cells onto SS, Ti and Al2O3 as well as PET during the first 90 min of a cell culture attachment assay are a function of adsorption of serum Vn onto the surface.","CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,SYDNEY LAB,N RYDE,NSW 2113,AUSTRALIA; BROWN UNIV,RHODE ISL HOSP,DEPT ORTHOPAED,PROVIDENCE,RI 02903","HOWLETT, CR (reprint author), UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PATHOL,POB 1,KENSINGTON,NSW 2033,AUSTRALIA.",,"Evans, Margaret/B-3261-2011","Evans, Margaret/0000-0003-3078-1576; Walsh, William/0000-0002-5023-6148",,,,50,136,137,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1994.0,15,3,,,,,213,222,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90070-1,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,MZ910,WOS:A1994MZ91000009,7515290.0,,,,2019-02-25

Photomicrographs of histology sections of implant sites are provided to illustrate the key events in the temporal sequence of inflammation and wound healing. Examples of biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymeric delivery systems are presented and discussed. The cage implant system which provides a sensitive, reliable, reproducible, and quantifiable system to determine the temporal variations in inflammatory cell concentration and function in the inflammatory response to implanted biomedical polymer or drug-polymer delivery systems is presented and discussed.

The nature of the blood response involving interactions of systems, pattern and extent of change, patient status and the influence of the whole device contribute to the complexity. Recognising these, the profile of the blood response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), with respect to type of device, mode of blood flow, duration of the procedure and patient status, has been evaluated by monitoring contact phase activation [Factor XII-like activity (FXIIA)], fibrinolytic activity [Fibrin degradation products (X-FDP's)], complement activation (C3a, C5a), leucocyte activation [Granulocyte elastase (GE)] and platelet and white cell imaging. FXIIA, X-FDP's, and GE rose gradually during CPB, with levels remaining elevated post-operatively for up to 48 h. In contrast, C3a levels rose sharply with no significant elevation in the post-operative period, while C5a did not show significant changes during bypass. The use of pulsatile perfusion resulted, in lesser activation of the parameters, although these were significantly less only for GE. The alterations in FXIIA, X-FDP's, C3a and GE correlated positively with the duration of CPB, with this effect pronounced in the post-operative period for FXIIA, X-FDP's and GE. However, these changes had no apparent influence on clinical outcome and the majority of patients had uncomplicated post-operative recoveries. With respect to the use of bubble/membrane oxygenators, platelet and white cell deposition and the patterns of change for FXIIA and C3a were similar in the two groups. The investigation has enabled a broad perspective of biocompatibility in CPB relevant to the clinical application of biomaterials.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,WOLFSON CTR,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT CARDIAC SURG,GLASGOW,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT MED,GLASGOW G31 2ER,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,26,17,17,0,3,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The animals were sacrificed at 1, 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Undecalcified histologic sections were prepared, evaluated qualitatively, and quantified with the aid of an image analysis system. The percentage of bone contact was determined morphometrically for all PEO/PBT proportions; for the 70/30 ratio, the percentage of calcification of the material surface and of bone-bonding (defined as a continuum at the light microscopic level between calcification within the material surface and bone tissue) were also assessed. PEO/PBT copolymers possess hydrogelic properties, and a direct relation has been established between water-uptake and PEO content. The swelling behavior of all PEO/PBT substrates resulted in a high degree of bone contact (over 95%) at early stages. From the 12-week survival time onward the 70/30 revealed higher percentages of bone contact (over 80%) when compared with the other ratios (60/40, 55/45, 40/60, and 30/70). This difference was statistically confirmed 1 year postoperatively. The materials with the higher PEO contents showed the highest amounts of calcification, which is reflected by the rate of bone-bonding (70% of bone-bonding for the 70/30 at 52 weeks). Calcification and bone-bonding were not observed for 40/60 and 30/70 proportions. The quantitative results confirmed the relation between PEO content, water-uptake, calcification, and bone-bonding. It was furthermore demonstrated that PEO/PBT copolymers initially establish a high degree of bone contact, whereas the bone-bonding properties, especially of the 70/30, accomplish a long-term implant fixation.

Recently, we described an efficient cross-linking process via the formation of acyl azide groups on methylated carboxyl groups of collagen using hydrazine and nitrous acid (referred to here as the hydrazine method). In this report, we propose a simpler, faster way to prepare acyl azide groups and to cross-link collagen-based biomaterials, using diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) as a reagent. After determining the optimal conditions of cross-linking with DPPA, we compared the efficiency of this protocol with that using hydrazine and with the classical glutaraldehyde treatment. In order to validate and quantitate the extent of reaction, the degree of crosslinking was determined by the measure of the free primary amino group content of the samples. Treatment of native bovine pericardium with 0.5% DPPA for 24h led to efficient cross-linking, corresponding to a 50% decrease in the free primary amino group content of the sample and raising its thermal stability from 62.8 up to 81.3 degrees C. In comparison, the thermal stabilities of glutaraldehyde or hydrazine-treated pericardium were 85 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 83.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Similar decreases in free primary amino group content and increases in thermal stability were obtained for collagen films treated with DPPA, glutaraldehyde, or hydrazine. These results were corroborated by resistance to bacterial collagenase digestion: DPPA-treated pericardium had a resistance to collagenase digestion similar to that of glutaraldehyde- or hydrazine-treated pericardium. Residual DPPA content was measured by determining the phosphorus content: the concentration of phosphorus in tissue treated with 0.5% DPPA was not significantly different from that of untreated tissue. Treatment by DPPA thus appears to be an efficient, rapid method for cross-linking collagen-based biomaterials.

In an attempt to optimize the fixation process, experiments were carried out with two types of collagen (native collagen membrane and synthetic collagen sheet) to study the effect on crosslinking of temperature, GA concentration and fixation time. Secondly, stimulation of GA diffusion was studied and finally, a procedure of low T-presoaking followed by brief exposure to high temperatures was investigated. As a measure of the degree of crosslinking the shrinkage temperature (T(s)) was determined. Temperature (20-degrees-C or 45-degrees-C), concentration (0.1% or 1.0%) or fixation time (4 or 24 h) were found to be positively correlated with the T(s) of the collagen sheets. Whereas untanned collagen exhibits a T(s), of around 60-degrees-C, short-term (1 or 5 min), high-temperature (50-degrees-C) fixation with a 0.1% GA solution caused the shrinkage temperature to increase to 72-degrees-C and 85.1-degrees-C, respectively. Fixation with 0.01% GA for 5 min at 50-degrees-C appeared equally effective as 1 min with 0.1% GA (T(s) = 70-degrees-C). Microwave irradiation showed to be slightly more effective in enhancing the crosslinking process compared with conventional heating. Surprisingly, at any combination of temperature, concentration and fixation periods of 4 h or 24 h, an increased T(s) towards the central regions of the collagen was observed. Soaking the samples at 20-degrees-C (1 h) or at 0-degrees-C (3 h) with subsequent short-time heating to 45-degrees-C caused an almost equal rise in T(s) throughout the collagen samples and is therefore recommended for preparing implantable tissues.","LEIDEN CYTOL & PATHOL LAB,2312 SP LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS","RUIJGROK, JM (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV,DEPT BIOMAT,BLD 55,RIJNSBURGERWEG 10,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,19,36,36,0,9,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The contact structure and the reaction of the contact associated contractile cytoskeleton were studied using fibres of different flexibility/mobility: butyl-S-Sepharose (S), Polysulfone (PS) and Polyurethane (PU). Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical investigations were carried out to obtain information on the influence of tension on (1) the structure of the focal contacts; (2) the constricting cytoskeleton known to retract adherent collagen or fibrin fibres and (3) the cable-like bundles of actomyosin as observed in the clot. Fibre network from S spheres and 0.3 mm thick frozen sections of PS or PU were incubated with citrated PRP or with washed platelets at 37 degrees C for 6 to 30 min while stirring for contact or activation with ADP or thrombin. Flexible fibres of the BM were found in deep invaginations of the plasmalemma associated with the constricting cytoskeleton. Focal contacts (mediated by fibrinogen as shown immunocytochemically) with fibres which were fixed in the texture or inflexible (PU) induce cable-like bundles of micofilaments containing myosin. These bundles pass across the cytoplasm and connect the contacts with the fibres or with Other platelets, as demonstrated by computer-assisted 3-dimensional reconstruction. The model used indicates that retraction is possible as long as fibres are mobile and that cable-like bundles occur when the locomotion of platelets is blocked by immobile fibres.

The knowledge of the bacterial flora allows the identification of bacteria which could be responsible for postsurgical infections. These floras are complex and their equilibrium can be modified by various factors, such as hospitalization, co-existing disease, medico-surgical procedure, administration of antibiotics, which cause the selection of the so-called hospital-bacteria feared by therapists. The infection will develop according to the quantity of bacteria that have been introduced and to their virulence, which is often altered by local factors, especially the biomaterials. The knowledge of pharmacodynamic parameters such as bactericidal activity, postantibiotic effect, activity on virulence factors (bacterial adhesion), allows the refinement of the choice of the antibiotic and the optimization of its posology.",,"DRUGEON, HB (reprint author), CTR ETUDES & RECH MICROBIOL APPL,ROUTE PARC SOUVENIR,F-06500 MENTON,FRANCE.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"141 RUE JAVEL, 75747 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",0750-7658,,,ANN FR ANESTH,Ann.

A mathematical model expressing the removal rate as a function of pertinent parameters was developed. The parameters included superficial air velocity, bubble size, bubble rising velocity, surfactant diffusion coefficient, and concentration. The model indicated that surfactant removal can be described as a first-order process whose rate increases with the diffusion coefficient, the superficial air velocity and the surfactant concentration in the bulk solution, but decreases with bubble size and bubble rising velocity. Based on the assumption of a completely mixed reactor within a section of a foam fractionator, a simplified model for foam fractionation under batch operation conditions was also presented. This simplified model provides a theoretical basis according to which the diffusion coefficient of surfactants can be determined and the model itself can be verified with experimental data.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT AGR & BIOL ENGN,ITHACA,NY 14853; CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN,ITHACA,NY 14853","CHEN, SL (reprint author), LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803, USA.",,,,,,,33,15,15,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0144-8609,,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

Concentration changes of proteins which were believed to be the major surfactants in fish culture water were analyzed for different fractionator operating conditions. Experimental results indicate that a foam fractionator operated under batch conditions can be treated as a completely mixed reactor. The diffusion coefficient of proteins as surfactants was in the order of 10-12 m2/s. Protein removal rate by a foam fractionation process was proportional to the protein concentration in bulk solution and air flow rate. Other pertinent parameters that were also evaluated included bubble size and bubble rising velocity.

The intrinsic coagulation pathway was studied by bringing a variety of biomaterials into contact with a plasma aliquot and observing the rate of clotting diminish by virtue of factor XII activation. The efficacy of heparinization was investigated by measuring the increase in clotting time of a plasma aliquot during biomaterial contact. In both cases, clotting time was measured turbidometrically. Marked differences in intrinsic pathway activation were observed between a variety of materials. There were clear differences between the materials and the negative and positive controls.

In the present study, we have used morphological techniques to examine the tissue response to titanium implants, and (immuno)cytochemistry to identify and characterize the organic moieties present at the bone-implant interface. Miniature titanium screws were implanted into rat tibiae. Animals were sacrificed at 1 day to 5 months post-implantation and tissues were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy, lectin-gold cytochemistry for glycoconjugates, and protein A-gold immunolabeling for non-collagenous bone and plasma proteins. Other rats were injected with H-3-proline, 4 days prior to sacrifice, to examine bone matrix deposition. New bone formation was observed soon after implantation, first as cancellous bone, which then remodeled relatively quickly into more compact bone. Radioautography confirmed bone matrix deposition in the vicinity of the implant. The presence of osteoblasts, osteoid or mineralized matrix against the implant surface indicates that bone deposition can occur both toward, and at the surface of, and then away from, the implant. Tissue components at the bone-implant interface included cells, cell debris and/or organic material with a variable appearance and thickness. A portion of the implant surface was covered with a layer (cement line/lamina limitans) rich in glycoconjugates that was intensely immunolabeled for osteopontin and alpha(2)HS-glycoprotein. Osteocalcin, fibronectin and albumin showed no preferential accumulation at the bone-implant interface. In conclusion, based on structural and compositional similarities between cement lines in bone and the bone-titanium interface, the host response to biomaterials may be similar to those osteogenic processes occurring at natural bone interfaces.","MCGILL UNIV,FAC DENT,MONTREAL H3A 2B2,PQ,CANADA; MCGILL UNIV,DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL,MONTREAL H3A 2B2,PQ,CANADA","NANCI, A (reprint author), UNIV MONTREAL,FAC DENT,CP 6128 CTR VILLE,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,PQ,CANADA.",,,,,,,60,64,65,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,1,,,,,1,30,,,,,,30,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PG257,WOS:A1994PG25700001,,,,,2019-02-25

For reasons of automation, to facilitate standardization and aid reproducibility, more objective evaluation of cytotoxic effects by quantitative methods would be preferable. In this study, three quantitative methods for cytotoxicity testing were compared with a reference method based on the examination of cell morphology. The influence of extracts of negative and positive control materials on HeLa cells was evaluated using quantitative parameters: number of cells (protein determination), viability (MTT-test), and DNA synthesis (incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine). The tests were performed according to the British Standard BS 5736 Part 10. Results were compared with those of morphological observations (reference method). Protein determination and MTT-test showed reproducible results and a good relationship with the results obtained by examining the morphology of cells. Although incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was the most sensitive test, it did not give sufficiently reproducible results as specified in BS 5736, Part 10. The main advantage of the presented tests is that they all can be performed in microtiter plates using optical density as parameter, which means that the assays can easily be automated.","UNIV MAINZ KLINIKUM, INST PATHOL, MAINZ, GERMANY","DEKKER, A (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN KLINIKUM, INST PATHOL, D-52057 AACHEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,16,37,41,0,6,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,101,112,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000001,,,,,2019-02-25

The aim of this work was to extend an organ culture method previously developed on vascular endothelium to trabecular bone. Trabecular bone cells from chick embryos and humans were comparatively grown on a control material (Thermanox(R)) and on a stainless steel 316L substrate. Two different cell types were observed around human bone explants: adherent fusiform osteoblastic cells, and non-adherent round bone marrow cells. All adherent cells were positive for alkaline phosphatase. Human cells synthesized type I collagen, osteopontin and fibronectin. Type III collagen, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein could not be detected in human cells by immunocytochemistry. Chick embryo cells synthesized type I and type III collagen and fibronectin. Type II collagen could not be detected in any species. Human cell layers were more extended and exhibited a greater number of cells than chick embryo layers. The growth parameters of chick embryo cultures displayed higher variations than human cultures. A preliminary comparison of cell growth on Thermanox(R) and on a stainless steel 316L substrate showed that human and chick embryo osteoblastic cells had similar behaviour on both materials. In conclusion, this organotypic culture method could be applied to both human and chick embryo trabecular bone. It allowed the growth of cells having the phenotype of immature osteoblasts. The culture method needs further improvement for cytocompatibility analysis.","UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELL EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE; HOP LARIBOISIERE,INSERM,U349,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","ANSELME, K (reprint author), INST CALOT,INST RECH MALAD SQUELETTE,RUE DR CALOT,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE.",,,"Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,27,12,12,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,113,123,,,,,,11,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000002,,,,,2019-02-25

To allow investigation of the interfacial area between the cells and the metallic substrates, these materials were removed by an electrodissolution process. With such samples, a remaining titanium oxide layer was observed in close apposition with the bottom of the cell sheet. This layer was discontinuous, variable in thickness, and contained large amounts of carbon but no calcium. Contamination of the cell layer by titanium, due to the electrochemical process, was detected by electron energy loss spectrometry. The presence of mineralized matrix was demonstrated in the nodules formed by the cells on every type of specimen, but was never found in direct contact with the substrates. The thin layer of extracellular material ensuring the linkage with the substrates was not mineralized. Matrix-mediated contacts were composed of patches of collagenous material or fibrillar non-organized material. Fibronectin was detected on the substrates by fluorescence microscopy after mechanical detachment of the cell layer. The absence of a mineralized interface appears to be related to the surface properties of the substrates, but also to the cell origin. This might reflect the in vivo case of osteointegration failure, when the tissue is composed of a layer of non-mineralized connective tissue in contact with smooth materials.","ECOLE CENT LYON,TECHNOL SURFACES LAB,CNRS,URA 855,F-69130 ECULLY,FRANCE; ECOLE CENT LYON,MAT MECAN PHYS LAB,CNRS,URA 447,F-69130 ECULLY,FRANCE","BOUVIER, M (reprint author), FAC ODONTOL LYON,DEV & PATHOL TISSUS DENT LAB,CNRS,UPR 412,RUE GUILLAUME PARADIN,F-69372 LYON 8,FRANCE.",,,,,,,43,11,11,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,135,142,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000004,,,,,2019-02-25

We have developed histological studies on the effects of minerals and systemic factors on endosteal osteoblasts using the model of the rodent caudal vertebrae. The cellular responsiveness to hormones and growth factors was also studied in vitro using endosteal osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse caudal vertebrae. in vivo studies showed that the osteoblastic function is directly affected by phosphate, magnesium, and strontium, which may have important implications on the interactions between biomaterials and bone cells. Systemic agents were shown to have direct effects on endosteal bone formation and osteoblast function, and indirect effects through changes in bone resorption. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that hormones (vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, testosterone, estrogens) and growth factors (epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth factor P) regulate directly and indirectly the proliferation and differentiation of endosteal osteoblastic cells, and play a major role in the induction of vertebral bone formation.

Since slight differences in purity, chemical composition and crystal structure of calcium phosphates can have significant effects on cell behaviour, the calcium phosphate component of the foils was analysed by X-ray diffraction. Some aspects of cellular activity in relation to the zeta potential and interfacial tension of the different surfaces were determined. Primary bovine osteoblasts were grown on the surfaces and growth and differentiation were examined. The results show that the late of cell attachment was faster on surfaces with lower surface tension. The highest indicator for differentiation was found on the biocomposite with the lowest zeta potential. Scanning electron microscope investigations showed good attachment and growth of osteoblast-like cells on all materials. It is concluded that different material properties have distinct influences on cell reactions, the zeta potential being more important than interfacial tension for differentiation.","UNIV MUNSTER,CELL BIOL LAB,D-48129 MUNSTER,GERMANY; GESELL GESUNDHEIT & UMWELTFORSCH MBH,D-65933 FRANKFURT,GERMANY; UNIV WURZBURG,DEPT EXPTL DENT,D-97070 WURZBURG,GERMANY",,,,,,,,41,12,12,1,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,3,,,,,263,274,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QF980,WOS:A1994QF98000005,,,,,2019-02-25

Material coated with albumin may be ''passivated'' and unlikely to trigger either thrombogenic or inflammatory responses whereas implants preincubated with plasma may attract large number of phagocytes. In an effort to understand the basis of inflammatory responses to biomaterials, we have employed implants made of polyester terephthalate. This review briefly summarizes our recent progress in determining the importance of adsorbed proteins in the attraction of phagocytic cells to device surfaces. Our initial hypothesis was that spontaneous adsorption of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was critical in later inflammatory reactions. Although samples of Mylar film, preincubated with purified IgG and implanted in mice did, as expected, prompt the accumulation of large numbers of phagocytes shortly after implantation, so also did uncoated material implanted in severely hypogammaglobulinemic mice (with severe combined immune-deficiency), implying that surface adsorption of IgG was not a necessary precedent to phagocyte responses. However, we subsequently observed that material preincubated with plasma promoted phagocyte recruitment whereas implants pre-coated with serum did not. The critical plasma component is evidently fibrinogen; not only does fibrinogen coated material attract phagocytes but uncoated material implanted in hypofibrinogen-emic mice fails to elicit an inflammatory response (unless pre-coated with fibrinogen). This pro-inflammatory effect of adsorbed fibrinogen suggests an interesting connection between two of the major iatrogenic effects of implanted and blood contact biomaterials: thrombosis and inflammation.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,ALBANY,NY 12208",,,,,,,,44,33,33,1,8,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,4,,,,,429,436,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QP351,WOS:A1994QP35100012,,,,,2019-02-25

Three important questions that pertain to surgical implants are (1) What are the mechanisms that cause abnormal inflammatory responses in the absence of infection and result in interface cellular disorganization and device failure? (2) What causes host defenses to be compromised to the extent that normal flora organisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis, with little or no virulence potential, can cause life-threatening infections at the implant-host interface? (3) What is the nature of surface regions of biomaterials that facilitate bacterial adherence? Pathogenic strains of S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus have an affinity for biomaterial surfaces and are capable of initiating infection. Binding may be nonspecific and gluelike rather than a receptor-ligand event as for S. aureus and matrix proteins. This study indicates bacterial binding to sites of higher vanadium concentration at grain boundaries and mixed phases in titanium alloys. Repeated macrophage priming by biomaterial particulates results in the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, macrophage exhaustion, and adjacent tissue damage. A cytokine cascade is also initiated. A self-perpetuating enlarging immune-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone develops about implants, which features tissue cell damage, increased susceptibility to infection, and results in septic or aseptic failure of the implant. These effects are clearly exemplified by fibrosis about breast implants and osteolysis at the interface of total joint replacements.",,"GRISTINA, AG (reprint author), MED SCI RES INST,HERNDON,VA 22071, USA.",,,,NIADDK NIH HHS [AM 26957]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM 35939],,,35,166,169,0,12,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

The electrochemical behavior of these biomaterials is of interest for a variety of reasons. The corrosion resistance of an implant material influences its functional performance and durability and is a primary factor governing biocompatibility. Among the aspects affecting biocompatibility are the amounts and farms of released corrosion products and their disposition in the body after release. Electrochemical principles are very useful for understanding the factors affecting corrosion resistance and also form the foundation for many biosensors that measure the concentration of various chemical entities (including released corrosion products and naturally occurring substances). Many electrochemical measurement techniques have been used to study biomaterials for years (e.g., polarization curve measurement), while others (such as polarography and AC impedance methods) have been applied more recently. This work focuses on four main topics. The first is the nature of the body's environment as it affects in vivo electrochemical phenomena, that is, the chemical, mechanical, biological, and bioelectrical phenomena that affect the behavior and performance of biomaterials. The second deals with methodology - the techniques used for corrosion measurement and concentration determination, the appropriate environment (laboratory, cell culture, in vivo, etc.), and experimental problems encountered. The third topic treated is the knowledge accumulated regarding the performance of implant alloys in various applications, for example, the forms of corrosion to which they are susceptible, etc. Finally, improvements that may come about in the future regarding both materials and testing methodology are considered.",,"BUNDY, KJ (reprint author), TULANE UNIV, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70118 USA.",,,,,,,1672,83,83,0,26,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",0278-940X,1943-619X,,CRIT REV BIOMED ENG,Crit.

The investigations of vacuum contact drying process in which dried material adheres closely to a hot surface were performed. In order to make possible the determination of optimal process parameters the measurements were performed for various constant temperatures of the hot surface, total pressures in vacuum chamber and layer thickness of biomaterials. The effective thermal properties for dry layers of selected biomaterials depending on temperature and total pressure were also experimentally determined. A mathematical model of the vacuum contact drying for most intensive regime of its performance i.e. boiling one was presented.

In the design and development of formulations to achieve this goal, the formulation scientist must consider the clinical indication, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and physicochemical stability of the drug. The development of a stable formulation is a necessary step for each new protein or peptide therapeutic. The degradation pathways and their impact on stability should be systematically analyzed and competing degradation rates must be balanced to arrive at the most stable formulation possible. Several routes of administration should also be considered and future development of new formulations may expand the number of potential options. Formulations for each route of administration may be unique and, therefore, have special requirements. In the case of depot formulations, there are many potential matrices, each of which has distinct characteristics that affect its interactions with the drug and its behavior in vivo. The formulation characteristics may have a dramatic impact on the in vivo stability of the drug as well as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The optimization of formulations, the routes of delivery, the design of depot systems, and the correlation between physicochemical stability and in vivo behavior are discussed in detail with recent examples. For new biotechnology-derived drugs including nucleic acids (DNA vectors and antisense RNA) to reach commercialization, all of the issues involved in the design and development of a drug formulation must be considered at an early stage of the overall development process.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","CLELAND, JL (reprint author), GENENTECH INC, S SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94080 USA.",,"Sanguansri, Luz/B-6630-2011","Sanguansri, Luz/0000-0003-1908-7604",,,,103,26,26,1,1,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,,0-8412-2959-7,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

The preservation of proteins during freezing and drying is fundamentally different for each process. Protection of labile proteins during freezing appears to be due to the same thermodynamic mechanism that accounts for solute-induced stabilization in nonfrozen aqueous solution. Namely, preferential exclusion of the solute leads to stabilization of the native state of the protein. Protection of proteins during drying by sugars is due to the sugar hydrogen bonding to the dried protein and serving as a water replacement. Recovery of enzyme activity after freeze-drying and rehydration correlates directly with the maintenance of the native protein structure in the dried state. Sugars protect labile proteins by inhibiting lyophilization-induced unfolding. Finally, certain polymers (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone). protect freeze-dried multimeric enzymes during freeze-drying and rehydration. These compounds cannot serve as ''water replacements'' in the dried state. Rather they inhibit the freezing- and drying-induced dissociation. The fully polymerized oligomers are more resistant to these stresses.","AMGEN INC,AMGEN CTR,THOUSAND OAKS,CA 91320","CARPENTER, JF (reprint author), UNIV COLORADO,HLTH SCI CTR,SCH MED,DENVER,CO 80262, USA.",,,,,,,33,51,51,0,11,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0097-6156,,0-8412-2959-7,ACS SYM SER,,,1994.0,567,,,,,,134,147,,,,,,14,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,BB32M,WOS:A1994BB32M00009,,,,,2019-02-25

In this perspective, the consideration of biological membranes at a molecular level requires detailed knowledge of the preferred conformations of the triglycerides in their various polymorphic forms. In this context, we adapted a molecular modeling approach, which allows the simulation the three-dimensional structure of the different polymorphic forms (alpha, beta', and beta) valid for any triglyceride. Their conformational analysis is based on molecular mechanics calculations, as follows: First, a large number of isolated molecular structures were generated in asystematic structure-tree analysis. For their generation, atomic charges within the Mulliken scheme, calculated at the ab initio RHF-LCAO-MO-SCF level (6-31G), were considered. The lowest-energy conformers were, next, correlated with experimental data (NMR, powder X-ray diffraction) in order to select alpha, beta', or beta structures. Then, in a second step, these selected conformers were assembled, in head-to-tail dimers in order to form a monolayer. For this step, the use of potential-derived atomic charges is known to be more suitable. In this study, we consider triglycerides derived from the predominant fatty acids, i.e., stearic, elaidic, and oleic acids.

The D-H-D polymer product was characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13-NMR). D-H-D was physisorbed on polyethylene (PE) from aqueous solution, and the adhesion stability and resistance to protein adsorption was examined under static and dynamic flow conditions, using a modified rotating disk system. Modified surfaces were characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and by water contact angles. Under applied shear stresses of up to 73 dyn cm(-2), the adhesion of D-H-D on PE was sufficient to inhibit desorption by water (>90% D-H-D on PE was retained) and 5% SDS surfactant solution (approximately 83% D-H-D retained), as determined by ATR-FTIR. Under similar shear stress conditions, albumin adsorption on D-H-D modified PE was reduced by over 90%, and protein adsorption from fresh human plasma was reduced by approximately 70% compared with unmodified PE. The results are discussed in terms of interfacial forces, and the suitability of this approach for studying protein-surface interactions and for developing a novel class of protein-resistant biomaterials.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106","MARCHANT, RE (reprint author), CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-40047],,,50,42,44,1,16,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The adhesion of HPL was shown to be dependent not only on the wettability but also on the protein preadsorbed. Vitronectin expressed not only a higher extent of adhesion under static conditions but also a stronger interaction with HPL, indicated by the low detachment under shear stress. The flow experiments also demonstrated that FN adsorbed on octadecyl glass may undergo conformational changes because HPL could be easily removed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that HPL on both FN-and VN-coated glass spread well whereas particularly on FN-coated octadecyl glass less cell spreading was observed; moreover, some round cells were detected. The typing of adherent HPL by immunofluorescence microscopy showed that on FN- and VN-coated glass about 70% of all HPL were T-cells (CD 3+). However, on octadecyl glass, particularly on VN, a smaller percentage of CD 3+cell was observed. The testing for the beta(1) integrin-the receptor for FN and the alpha(v) integrin-the receptor for VN demonstrated that about 70% of all cells on FN-coated glass were positive for the beta(1) integrin. On VN-coated glass, however, only 5% of HPL were positive for the beta(1) integrin. Although on VN a high adhesion and strong binding of HPL was observed, no presence of the alpha(v)integrin was detected.","BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,CENT LAB BIOPHYS,BU-1113 SOFIA,BULGARIA","GROTH, T (reprint author), HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH MED,BIOMAT RES UNIT,TUCHHOLSKYSTR 2,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,37,24,24,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Isolated human blood neutrophils were allowed to interact with the polymer surface and the chemiluminescence response of the cells was recorded as a measure of oxidative activation. The polymers represented surfaces that differed markedly with respect to charge, hardness, and wettability. We found that all polymers stimulated the chemiluminescence response in neutrophils differently; when preincubation with human serum albumin (HSA) there was a general reduction of the chemiluminescence response particularly on one of the positively charged surface 1, 2-diamino-cyclohexane (DACH). Addition of a soluble stimulus, the chemoattractant formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP), to the cells caused a dramatic increase in the response on one of the hydrophobic surface hexamethylene-isiloxane (HMDSO). However, there was also a pronounced reduction in the response on polymers with acrylic acid (AA). The response was normalized after addition of HSA. Taken together, the chemiluminescene response of the neutrophils interacting with the polymer surfaces differed with regard to the type of surfaces. When HSA and FMLP were added a larger difference in the response was found. Our results showed that the activation of human neutrophil granulocytes influenced by different polymer surfaces, followed unspecific different patterns which were someway related to the specific characteristics of the polymer and from this point we came to similar conclusions made by Kaplan et al. (J. Biomater. Res. 28, 377 (1994)), that it is difficult to extrapolate any activation mechanisms from one material to another. The reproducibility of the reaction patterns, the importance of neutrophil activation, and the relative simplicity of the method indicates, however, that the mechanisms of neutrophil activation at biomaterial surface is well worth further research.","LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL IMMUNOL & INFECT DIS,LINKOPING,SWEDEN; INST SURFACE CHEM,S-11486 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","NIMERI, G (reprint author), LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT PHYS & MEASUREMENT TECHNOL,APPL PHYS LAB,INTERFACE BIOL GRP,S-58183 LINKOPING,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,28,4,4,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The diphenols were a homologous series of three desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters (ethyl, hexyl, octyl) which had previously been used in the synthesis of mechanically strong and tissue-compatible polycarbonates. The diacids (succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid) were selected among compounds that were known to be of low systemic toxicity. By using different diacids as comonomers, the flexibility of the polymer backbone could be varied while the desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters provided pendent chains of various length. Some of the thermal and mechanical properties of the five polymers could be correlated to their chemical structure: the glass transition temperature decreased from 53 to 13 degrees C, and the tensile modulus (measured at room temperature) decreased from 1500 to about 3 MPa when the length of the aliphatic diacid in the polymer backbone and/or the length of the alkyl ester pendent chain was increased. The presence of an arylate bond in the polymer backbone introduced a hydrolytically labile linkage into the polymer structure. Under physiological conditions in vitro all polymers degraded: thin films retained only about 30-40% of their initial molecular weight (M(w)) after 26 weeks of storage in phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Release studies with p-nitroaniline as a model drug indicated that a diffusion controlled release process occurred. The rate of p-nitroaniline release could be correlated with the glass transition temperature of the polymer.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ",,,,,,,,29,49,49,0,7,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Infrared spectra showed the presence of amide groups, including those cases where the volatile compound ('monomer') did not contain oxygen. The performance of the surfaces in cell attachment correlated with the surface hydrophilicity and the nitrogen content, although for the latter a fair degree of scatter indicated that a more complex relationship applies. All these surfaces supported the attachment and growth of human cells. Generally, amide plasma polymers were best but the individual monomer and the plasma parameters also played a role. From comparisons of the various surfaces, it is suggested that the amide group is the main promoter of cell attachment in nitrogen-containing plasma surfaces.","CSIRO, DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN, N RYDE, NSW 2113, AUSTRALIA","GRIESSER, HJ (reprint author), CSIRO, DIV CHEM & POLYMERS, PRIVATE BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA.",,"Griesser, Hans/E-5628-2011","Griesser, Hans/0000-0003-1072-7863",NCRR NIH HHS [RRO1296],,,61,158,160,1,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

This finding directly supports the hypothesis that hydrated silica plays an important role in biologically active hydroxyapatite formation on the surfaces of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics, which leads to bone-bonding. Gel-derived titania is also a hydroxyapatite inducer because of its abundant TiOH groups. These results provide further insight into the unique osseointegration of titanium and its alloys. It is suspected that gel-derived titania develops an apatite layer by taking calcium and phosphate from the body fluid, thus producing bone-bonding. Although sufficient A1OH groups may remain in the alumina gel, they do not serve to initiate apatite generation when immersed in SBF. This phenomenon explains the fact that an intermediate fibrous tissue is usually found to separate the alumina implant from bone. One may infer that both abundant OH groups and negatively charged surfaces of gel-derived silica and titania are important for hydroxyapatite induction.

In this study, two methods of in vitro enzyme degradation and a method for the separation of the degradative products by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) are reported. In the first method two dental adhesives, Scotchbond and Scotchbond II, and two dental composites, Heliomolar and P-50, were evaluated. These materials were incubated with four different enzymatic preparations for periods of up to 72 h. The enzymes were Lipase, esterase, and Liver enzyme extracts from both mouse and rat. Chloroform soluble products extracted from the aqueous phase were examined by HPTLC for decomposition products resulting from enzyme activity. The second method was similar, but analyzed the aqueous fraction directly without chloroform extraction. In this method five dental restorative materials, P-50, P-30, Scotchbond II, Silux, and Silux plus, were incubated with a nonspecific porcine liver esterase. In addition to the polymerized biomaterials, monomers containing methacrylic acid units were also hydrolyzed with esterase and analyzed by ion chromatography to establish the sensitivity of the enzyme simulator. Each biomaterial presented thin-layer zones not present before enzymatic action. These experiments provide support that aqueous enzymatic action may facilitate the hydrolytic weakening of polymeric biomaterials.

The biocompatibility was investigated by cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility tests; the cytotoxicity was tested by the Neutral Red uptake assay, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, the Kenacid Blue R-binding method, and by the cell proliferation test on polymer films; the hemocompatibility was tested by the contact activation both of the coagulation cascade (intrinsic pathway), by the plasma prekallikrein activation test, and of the thrombocytes, by measuring the release of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin.

The aim was to give an objective contribution at a molecular level to predict their biocompatibility. In particular, Raman spectra of explanted PMMA bone cements do not show the 1640 cm-1 band due to the stretching mode of C=C unsaturated centres. Moreover, conformational changes of PMMA following the implant appear in the spectra in the range 1100-500 cm-1, where conformational marker bands at 985, 968, 601 and 565 cm-1 are present. The limited number of HDPE explanted acetabular cups did not allow unequivocal Raman results to be obtained, by means of band deconvolution in the region between 1500 and 1000 cm-1, regarding the changes in the crystalline, amorphous and interfacial contents of the acetabular cup surfaces following the implant. Alpha-Al2O3 proved to be a ceramic with good biocompatibility as a biomaterial constituting a hip prosthesis. As regards the stem coating, Raman and Fourier transform IR spectra of HA pre-coating and HA coating on metal implants show spectroscopic modifications due to structural and chemical changes with formation of other calcium phosphates.

Present-day biomaterials being biocompatible when in bulk form, a host reaction consequent upon untoward effects of the implants as such is not expected. Thus, osseointegration, i.e., the direct apposition of bone to the surface of a foreign material at the light microscopical level, occurs, under favorable biomechanical circumstances, irrespective of the chemical composition of the implant. Osseointegration is a multifaceted phenomenon. First and foremost, it evolves when an initially rigid fixation of the component is surgically attained. Interfacial motions are associated with resorption of the bony bed, macrophagic activation and production of wear particles, the close bone-implant apposition is lost and the formation of an interfacial membrane (IM) ensues. The histological features of the IM coincide with the context of its formation and evolution. The quiescent IM is composed of a thin layer of fibrous tissue and its occurrence is compatible with the biofunctionality of the implant. The aggressive or lytic IM (LIM) develops when tissue-irritating, small, irregularly shaped and edgy breakdown products are deposited at the interface. The thick LIM consists of an inflamed fibrous tissue, scattered within which are myriad granulomas, and its surface facing the implant displays a synovial-like aspect. The mono-and polykaryonic macrophages, constituting the granulomatous response, ingest and abut on the wear particles. Amongst the intermediary substances of inflammation elaborated by the lymphocytes and macrophages of the LIM, factors which stimulate the osteoclasts play the pivotal role in as much as progressive bone resorption is associated with progressive growth of the IM and, hence, with incremental interfacial motion, interfacial deposition of wear particles and inflammatory-granulomatous response. The ensuing vicious circle culminates in aseptic loosening of the arthroplasty. The morphological features of the LIM, though characterized by a stereotypical reaction pattern, are, in their details, closely linked with the nature of the diverse components of the composite joint replacement. The histological appearances of the bone-implant interface of stable and loose arthroplasties, the tissular reactions to polymethylmethacrylate, polyethylene, polyacetal, metals and hydroxyapatite as well as the characteristics of cemented acid cementless porous-coated, press-fit and hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses are described.","BNAI ZION MED CTR, DEPT PATHOL, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL; BNAI ZION MED CTR, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL","BOSS, JH (reprint author), TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL, FAC MED, BRUCE RAPPAPORT INST RES MED SCI, CTR IMPLANT SURG, POB 4940, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL.",,,,,,,265,36,37,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

OPs initiate chondroblastic differentiation in pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, followed by the synthesis of new bone by endochondral ossification. OPs have the ability to induce healing of osteoperiosteal defects in several animal models, supporting a possible therapeutic role in the reconstruction of bone defects. OPs are responsible for the osteoinductive capacity of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) implants, which may also prove to be clinically useful. Preliminary studies using purified, naturally occurring human osteogenic proteins in the clinical management of non-unions have reported promising results. A prospective, randomized clinical trial is currently underway, comparing recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1) to autograft in the treatment of tibial non-unions.

The eventual retrieval and detailed analysis of implanted structures provides an invaluable opportunity to determine the characteristics of implant success or failure and to provoke the development of still better materials.",,"KAPLAN, SS (reprint author), UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,ROOM 5930,CHP MAIN TOWER, 200 LOTHROP ST, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM41734-04A1],,,148,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

A prospective study addressing these factors was therefore undertaken over an 11 month period. 51 patients presenting with significant capsular contracture, suspected prosthesis rupture or unrelieved implant-induced anxiety underwent revisional breast surgery after biochemical, haematological and immunological screening. Of these 51 patients (83 breasts), 14 (19 breasts) had ruptured implants (23% incidence). These were all smooth prostheses belonging to a cohort manufactured more than 10 years ago; their mean in situ duration being 12 years vs. 5.5 years for the intact group (p = 0.0024; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). There were no systemic complications from implant rupture and the mean blood silicon level was normal. One patient with pre-existing pernicious anaemia had elevated autoantibodies. The mean ESR in the ruptured implant group was 6 mm/hour. It is concluded that rupture of breast implants is not as uncommon as hitherto thought and is strongly correlated with their in situ duration. In this study implant gel leakage was not associated with serious systemic effects.","ST LUKES HOSP, DEPT RADIOL, BRADFORD BD7 1DP, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","MALATA, CM (reprint author), ST LUKES HOSP, DEPT PLAST SURG, BRADFORD BD7 1DP, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,69,29,29,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

In this study, microorganisms were isolated from biofilms on explanted prostheses after having been in place for various time intervals ranging from 1 to 67 d. The isolates were examined for their identity, adhesion to hexadecane and electrophoretic mobility. Bacteria from early (shorter than 8 d) and late (longer than 8 d) explants could not be classified according to their taxonomy, hydrophobicity or electrophoretic mobility. However, the yeasts clearly revealed a dominance of only hydrophilic Candida albicans isolates from early explants and only hydrophobic C. tropicalis isolates from late explants. These findings may be of significance for the development of strategies to control mixed biofilms on biomaterials.","UNIV GRONINGEN,MAT TECH LAB,9713 AV GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN,CTR BIOMED TECHNOL,9713 AV GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN,ENT DEPT,9713 AV GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS",,,,"Neu, Thomas/0000-0001-6990-8787",,,,16,19,19,0,3,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0891-060X,,,MICROB ECOL HEALTH D,Microb.

In a major focus of our research we have demonstrated an LB trough cassette approach to create ordered systems by using either a biotinylated lipid or a biotinylated polymer that first binds streptavidin protein. In a second step streptavidin binds added biotinylated phycoerythrin, a fluorescent antenna protein. For signal transduction possibilities, conducting polymers may be mixed with the biotinylated lipid in the LB monolayer film in this system. This cassette approach would allow the attachment and ordering of any biotinylated species. These techniques can yield ordered monolayer films possessing unusual optical and electronic properties for potential device applications.","USA,NATICK RES DEV & ENGN CTR,DIV BIOTECHNOL,NATICK,MA 01760; MOLEC TECHNOL INC,LOWELL,MA 01854; UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT PHYS,LOWELL,MA 01854","MARX, KA (reprint author), UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT CHEM,LOWELL,MA 01854, USA.",,,,,,,16,5,5,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0065-2393,,0-8412-2698-9,ADV CHEM SER,,,1994.0,240,,,,,,395,412,,,,,,18,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Chemistry,BB35X,WOS:A1994BB35X00015,,,,,2019-02-25

Two important aspects have been directly addressed. First, genetic engineering techniques have been used in conjunction with silane-based self-assembly systems to construct close-packed protein monolayers on optical substrates. The resulting structures have been characterized with immunological and surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy techniques. Recombinant DNA techniques have also been used to study the role of electrostatic forces in protein-protein interactions and may be used to gain control over the assembly of multicomponent protein thin films. In addition to these assembly considerations, protein engineering techniques can be used for a second purpose: the manipulation of optical and ET properties of heme proteins. Control over the heme absorption transition energies, redox potentials, and redox center composition can be realized through a combination of genetic engineering and protein. chemistry techniques. These experiments are aimed at producing multifunctional protein components with designed assembly and functional properties.","UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,URBANA,IL 61801",,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0065-2393,,0-8412-2698-9,ADV CHEM SER,,,1994.0,240,,,,,,475,490,,,,,,16,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Chemistry,BB35X,WOS:A1994BB35X00019,,,,,2019-02-25

The surface of all currently available biomaterials stimulate, microscopically or macroscopically, the host biological system when in direct contact. As a result, complement activation, blood coagulation, thrombus formation, encapsulation, and calcification take place. It has been shown that surface modification by grafting techniques can markedly reduce such stimulation, thus improving the interfacial biocompatibility of currently used biomedical polymers.

The shaft portion of these viral spikes is assembled from three identical protein strands and resembles a cylindrical or box beam on the molecular level. We report here the design, synthesis, and characterization of recombinant protein polymers based on multimers of 15 amino acid consensus sequences approximating the more complex natural protein. Spontaneous fibrillar aggregate formation in the genetically engineered analogs has been confirmed by various methods and the propensity of such aggregates to phase separate into liquid crystalline arrays has been observed. Moreover, it has been possible to spin filaments from liquid crystalline solutions and characterize their structure.
