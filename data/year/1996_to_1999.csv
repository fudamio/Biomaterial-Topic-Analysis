Although a periodontal connective tissue attachment offers distinct advantages, only osseointegration and fibro-osseous integration are at present clinically achievable. Recent studies indicate a periodontal regeneration-competent cell population and an appropriate biomaterial substrate both are required for periodontal connective attachment formation on biomaterial surfaces. We therefore have developed an in vitro model to characterize the effects of various biomaterial substrates on the early events of periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. Primary cultures of periodontal ligament and gingival connective tissue cells were cultured on uncoated (control) and coated (titanium- and hydroxyapatite-coated) tissue culture plastic, and the level of cell proliferation, collagen, and noncollagen protein synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity, and expression of a 42 kD cementum extracellular matrix protein were measured over 5, 7, and 9 days in culture. While all three substrates supported cell attachment, proliferation, and protein synthesis, only uncoated and titanium-coated tissue culture plastic supported expression of the cementum extracellular matrix protein after 9 days of culture. In addition, the levels of cell proliferation and collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis for cells grown on hydroxyapatite-coated surfaces lagged behind cells cultured on the control or titanium-coated surfaces at each of the three time points. These data suggest that biomaterial substrates markedly can influence the temporal sequence of extracellular matrix proteins associated with periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. In addition to surface composition (titanium versus hydroxyapatite), surface properties (e.g., topography) also may have an effect on periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. This model may be of use in designing biomaterials to support the formation of periodontal connective tissue attachment in vivo.

The experiments on the different samples are carried out using the same thermal history throughout the entire characterization process. The high-temperature current rise caused by the conductivity of the samples is studied with a simple model that utilizes an approximation of the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) relaxation time. The conductivity data is well reproduced except for temperatures well below the glass-transition temperature and for small currents. The glass-transition peak is modeled with a phenomenological expression valid near T-g, which is able to describe the glass relaxation with a minimum number of parameters. The conduction and the glass-transition relaxation are studied versus the structural changes for the different samples. It is found that the conductivity and the glass-transition temperature shift to lower temperatures as the methylene groups in the backbone increase. Furthermore, if the experimental data is presented as a function of the reduced temperature, the shape of the glass-transition relaxation for the different samples is independent of the polymer backbone length.

Mechanical testing of composite materials was performed using an Inova tensile/compression test machine. Bone/implant interaction and design parameters are also discussed. The structure of the TiNi alloy is modified in the casting process. Similar effects to those observed in the annealing process occurred in TiNi materials during casting and cooling of composites. The Ti-alloy matrix is composed of a mixture of cc and 13 phases. The interaction between the ceramic layer and the metallic components depends on the cooling rate in the casting process. Different reaction products were identified on the Al(2)O(3)/metal interface with dependence on the applied cooling rate of the composite. The fatigue life of the investigated composites is greater than 10(7) cycles, and mechanical properties are sufficient to carry loads expected in human medicine.

Optical characterization indicates a successful retention of protein conformation after encapsulation. The conformation retention is strongly correlated to both the rate of gelation and the subsequent drying speed. Using hemoglobin as a model protein, a higher colloidal solid concentration and a lower synthesis pH were found, both causing faster gelation, resulting in a better retention of conformation. Hemoglobin encapsulated in a thin film, which dries faster, also showed a better retention than in the bulk. This is attributed to the fact that when a protein is isolated, and especially when it is confined to a space close to its own dimensions, conformational changes are sterically hindered, hence the structural stability. Enzymatic activity of bovine liver catalase was also monitored and showed a remarkable improvement when encapsulated using the aqueous colloidal process, compared to using the conventional alkoxide-based process. Thus, the aqueous colloidal sol-gel process offers a promising alternative to the conventional sol-gel process for encapsulating biomolecules into transparent, porous matrices.

To design a biomedically useful polymer that is intrinsically infection-resistant, we have developed a ciprofloxacin-loaded polyurethane (PU) matrix that releases antibiotic locally at the implant surface, thereby minimizing bacterial accumulation. We report here the methods of fabrication and formulation for making such antibiotic-loaded devices, as well as evidence of their bactericidal properties. Specifically, various pore-forming agents and drug loadings were examined. An optimum formulation consisting of BIOSPAN(R) PU, poly(ethylene glycol) and ciprofloxacin offered the longest effective period of sustained release (5 days). The bactericidal efficacy of the released ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was four times that of the control PU without antibiotics. This bactericidal efficiency was due to an increase in the PA detachment from the surface. These observations suggested that the released ciprofloxacin was biologically active in preventing the bacteria from permanently adhering to the substratum, and thus decreasing the possibility of biofilm-related infection.

It is generally reported that the cytotoxicity of a chemical differs with cell lines. However, our previous study revealed a high correlation in the cytotoxicity of 43 metal salts between two murine cell Lines. If there is any generic tendency toward metal salt cytotoxicity for many kinds of cells, that information is helpful for the determination of the chemical composition of new metallic biomaterials that are expected to have lower cytotoxicity. In this study, the cytotoxicity of 12 metal salts was evaluated using four cell lines, and the results were compared, including those for two other cell lines obtained in our previous study. A metal salt concentration that reduced cell viability to 50% of that without any metal salt (IC50) was used as an index to compare the metal salt cytotoxicity between cell lines. The correlation was statistically proved by the IC(50)s of 12 metal salts among these cell Lines (p < 0.01), suggesting the existence of a generic tendency to metal salt cytotoxicity beyond cell lines. The metal salt order of toxicity from the highest was K2Cr2O7, AgNO3 VCl3, SbCl3,CuCl2,CoCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2,Cr(NO3)(3), FeCl3, TiCl4, and Al(NO3)(3).

Thus, lesions of this tissue are a pro-arthrotic factor, and up to now the conservative treatment of cartilage lesions and arthrosis does not yield satisfying results. Therefore, autologous transplantation of articular chondrocytes is being investigated in a variety of different assays. The aim of our study was to create a mechanically stable cell-matrix implant with viable and active chondrocytes which could serve to fill out articular lesions created in the knees of sheep. For this purpose, articular cartilage was collected from knee lesions, chondrocytes were liberated enzymatically and seeded in culture flasks and cultured till confluency. Cells were then trypsinized and grown on a type I/III collagen matrix (Chondro-Gide(TM) Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhusen, Switzerland) for 3, 6 and 10 days before being fixed and embedded for electron microscopy by routine methods. Scanning electron microscopy was performed after dehydration in acetone, critical point drying and sputter-coating with gold-paladium, Light microscopically, clusters of chondrocytes can be seen on the surface of the matrix with a few cells growing into the matrix. Transmission electron microscopic photographs yield a rather differentiated chondrocyte-like appearance, which is evidence of a matrix-induced redifferentiation after dedifferentiation during the growth period in the culture flasks. Scanning electron microscopic results show large, flattened chondrocytes without signs of differentiation on plastic, whereas chondrocytes grown on the Chondro-Gide(TM) sponge show a more roundish aspect wrapping firmly around the collagen fibrils, exhibiting numerous contacts with the matrix.

Despite widespread use of potent antibiotics, infections of artificial implants and catheters are of increasing concern. We tested whether local treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), long known as an inexpensive wound disinfectant, could prevent or reduce bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials. Methods. Two-centimeter-long pieces of polyurethane and silicone tubing were contaminated with a standardized solution of Staphylococcus epidermidis (10(5)/mL) and then rinsed and wiped with saline (0.9%) solution. Bacterial growth was assessed after incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Bacterial colonies were compared for the following treatments: wiping only with saline; wiping with 1.5%, 2%, or 3% H2O2; pretreating biomaterials with 3% H2O2 and subsequent contamination for 2 and 4 hours without treatment after contamination; and contamination of tubings I month after pretreatment with 30% H2O2. The effect of 3% H2O2 was also assessed on contamination with Escherichia coli. Results. Bacterial growth was reduced by more than 99% when the contaminated tubes were treated with 3% H2O2 compared with saline control (p < 0.001). Lower concentrations of H2O2 were less effective. The length of the contamination period had no influence on the effectiveness of H2O2 when used on polyurethane but did with silicone tubings. Pretreatment with H2O2 1 month before contamination still reduced bacterial growth rate by 90% on polyurethane and by 75% on silicone tubings. Comparable effects on bacterial growth rate were observed for staphylococci (-90%, p < 0.001) and escherichiae (-90%, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Local treatment with 3% H2O2 significantly reduced bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials even for I month after treatment. This finding might influence clinical strategies of prevention of foreign body infection.

Identically sized pins, prepared from poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), poly(DTH carbonate), and poly(DTO carbonate) were implanted transcortically in the proximal tibia and the distal femur of skeletally mature New Zealand White Rabbits. The tissue response at the bone-implant interface was characterized in terms of the absence of a fibrous capsule (direct bone apposition, indicative of a bone bonding response) or the presence of a fibrous capsule (referred to as the encapsulation response). The relative frequency of direct bone apposition versus encapsulation was recorded for each polymer throughout the entire period of the study. While all four polymers were tissue compatible, there was a correlation between the chemical structure of the pendent chain and the type of bone response observed, with poly(DTE carbonate) having the highest tendency to elicit direct bone apposition. Based on in vivo degradation data and the ability of moder polymers with carboxylate groups at their surface to chelate calcium ions, it is proposed that the ability of poly(DTE carbonate) to bond to bone is caused by the facile hydrolysis of the pendent ethyl eater groups which creates calcium ion chelation sites on the polymer surface. The incorporation of calcium chelation sites into the chemical structure of an implant material appears to be a key requirement if direct bone apposition/bone bonding is desired. This study demonstrates that very subtle changes in the chemical composition of an implant material can have significant effects on the long-term tissue response in a clinically relevant model.

In this paper, several in vitro and in vivo techniques from previously published results and current investigations are highlighted and presented to demonstrate means of delineating a part of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between biomaterials and macrophages. Complement component C3 was found critical in mediating the initial adhesion of human macrophages on medical-grade polyetherurethaneureas. From radioimmunoassay studies, the presence of a diphenolic antioxidant additive in polyetherurethaneureas increased the propensity for complement upregulation but did not affect adherent macrophage density. The subcutaneous cage-implant system was utilized to confirm the role of interleukin-4 in the fusion of adherent macrophages to form foreign body giant cells on polyurethanes in vivo. To probe the function-structural relationship of macrophage-active proteins, fibronectin was employed as a model in the formulation of synthetic oligopeptide mimetics. Peptides were grafted onto previously developed, non-cell adhesive polyethyleneglycol-based networks. The results indicate that grafted tripeptide RGD sequence supported higher adherent macrophage density than surfaces grafted with other peptides such as PHSRN and PRRAPV sequences. However, the formation of foreign body giant cells on peptide-grafted networks was highly dependent on the relative orientation between PHSRN and RGD sequences located in a single peptide.

Molecular analysis of the mechanism of enhanced migration on collagen-PLGA substrates showed that keratinocyte migration was sensitive to cell-derived fibronectin conditioning, but not to cell-secreted collagen conditioning. Fibronectin control of cell migration on collagen-PLGA was found to be both stoichiometric and biologically specific, mediated via adhesion involving keratinocyte alpha v integrin receptors. Based on our results, we propose a unique paradigm for induction of cell migration on a non-physiologic synthetic polymer using concerted interactions between primary, polymer-instructed matrix remodeling and secondary, cell-derived matrix remodeling.

To provide a more complete characterization of these interactions, analysis of lymphocyte migration on adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins must accompany the commonly performed adhesion studies. We report here a comparison of the migratory and adhesion behavior of Jurkat cells (a T lymphoblastoid cell line) on tissue culture treated and untreated polystyrene surfaces coated with Various concentrations of fibronectin. The average speed of cell locomotion showed a biphasic response to substrate adhesiveness for cells migrating on untreated polystyrene and a monotonic decrease for cells migrating on tissue culture-treated polystyrene. A modified approach to the persistent random walk model was implemented to determine the time dependence of cell migration parameters. The random motility coefficient showed significant increases with time when cells migrated on tissue culture-treated polystyrene surfaces, while it remained relatively constant for experiments with untreated polystyrene plates. Finally, a cell migration computer model was developed to verify our modified persistent random walk analysis. Simulation results suggest that our experimental data were consistent with temporally increasing random motility coefficients. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two-dimensional surfaces of poly(glycolide) (PGA), poly(L-lactide) (L-PLA), poly(D,L-lactide) (D,L-PLA), 85:15 poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (D,L-PLGA), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), 90:10 (D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (D,L-PLCL), 9:91 D,L-PLCL, 40:60 L-PLCL, 67:33 poly(glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PGTMC), and poly(dioxanone) (PDO) were made by spin-casting into uniform thin films. Adhesion kinetics were studied using TCPs and PCL films and revealed that the rate of chondrocyte adhesion began to level off after 6 h. Degree of HAC chondrocyte adhesion was studied on all the substrates after 8 h, and ranged from 47 to 145% of the attachment found on TCPS. The greatest number of chondrocytes attached to PGA and 67:33 PGTMC polymer films, and attachment to PCL and L-PLA films was statistically lower than that found on PGA (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between amount of chondrocyte attachment to the substrates and the substrates' water contact angle. Chondrocytes proliferated equally well on all the substrates resulting in equivalent cell numbers on all the substrates at both day 4 and day 7 of the culture. However, these total cell numbers were reached as a result of a 88- and 42-fold expansion on PDO and PLA, respectively, which was significantly higher than the Ii-fold expansion found on TCPS (p < 0.05). The greater fold expansion of the cells on PDO and L-PLA films may be attributed to the availability of space for cells to grow, since their numbers at the start of culture were fewer following the 8 h attachment period. This suggests that regardless of initial seeding density on these degradable polymer substrates (i.e., if some minimum number of cells are able to attach), they will eventually populate the surfaces of all these polymers given sufficient space and time.

The present study evaluated the adherence of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) to an acellular resorbable scaffold material derived from the small intestinal submucosa (SIS). HMECs were exposed to hydrated and dehydrated forms of SIS and to plastic surfaces coated with one of four different known components of the SIS extracellular matrix: collagen Type I, collagen Type IV, fibronectin, and laminin. Results showed that adherence of HMECs to hydrated SIS was greater than to any of the other tested surfaces (P < 0.05). Exposure of HMECs to either soluble collagen Type IV or soluble fibronectin prior to exposure of these cells to hydrated SIS showed only partial inhibition of HMEC attachment. We conclude that HMECs find hydrated SIS to be a suitable substrate for adherence and that dehydration of SIS adversely affects the ability of HMECs to adhere in vitro. The cause of HMEC adherence to SIS appears to be a combination of both its composition and architecture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition to acceleration of normal wound healing phenomena, endosseous implants should result in formation of a characteristic interfacial layer and bone matrix with adequate biomechanical properties. To achieve these goals, however, a better understanding of events at the interface and of the effects biomaterials have on bone and bone cells is needed. Such knowledge is essential for developing strategies to optimally control osseointegration. This paper reviews current knowledge of the bone-biomaterial interface and methods being investigated for controlling it. Morphological studies have revealed the heterogeneity of the bone-implant interface. One feature often reported, regardless of implant material, is an afibrillar interfacial zone, comparable to cement lines and laminae limitantes at natural bone interfaces. These electron-dense interfacial layers are rich in noncollagenous proteins, such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Several approaches, involving alteration of surface physicochemical, morphological, and/or biochemical properties, are being investigated in an effort to obtain a desirable bone-implant interface. Of particular interest are biochemical methods of surface modification, which immobilize molecules on biomaterials for the purpose of inducing specific cell and tissue responses or, in other words, to control the tissue-implant interface with biomolecules delivered directly to the interface. Although still in its infancy, early studies indicate the value of this methodology for controlling cell and matrix events at the bone-implant interface. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many cells on adhesive molecules will spread and form an organized actin cytoskeleton and complex transmembrane signaling regions called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions appear to function as both signaling and stabilizing components of normal adherent cell activity. To better understand adhesion formations between cells and their underlying substrata, we have designed, developed, and utilized a novel 'cytodetachment' methodology to quantify the force required to displace attached cells. We allowed bovine articular chondrocytes to attach and spread on a substratum of either fibronectin, bovine serum albumin, or standard microscope glass. The cytodetacher was then employed to displace the cells from the substratum. Our results demonstrate that a significantly greater force is required to detach cells from fibronectin versus the two other substrata, suggesting that a cell's actin cytoskeleton and perhaps focal adhesions contribute significantly to its mechanical adhesiveness. The cytodetacher allows us to directly measure the force required for cell detachment from a substratum and to indirectly determine the ability of different substrata to support cell adhesion.

Activation of the intracellular small molecular weight GTPase, RhoA, has recently been shown to play an essential role in controlling initiation of key integrin-mediated events in surface adhesion and proliferation. RhoA is interconvertible between an active, membrane-bound form and an inactive, cytosolic RhoGDI-bound form in response to integrin stimulation. This study reports the use of self-assembled functionalized organic alkylthiol monolayers (SAMs) as well-defined cell culture substrates to investigate the relationships between surface chemistry, RhoA activation and subsequent cell morphological and molecular level signal transduction responses in cells attaching to derivatized SAMs. Well-controlled alkylthiol surface chemistries were used to monitor and modulate the activation state of RhoA in attaching cells. Activation states were determined indirectly by fractionating cell lysates into membrane and cytosolic fractions by ultracentrifugation. Western blots were then performed, showing RhoA localization to be surface chemistry-dependent. RhoGDI levels and its intracellular localization were also shown to be surface-chemistry dependent. Cells cultured on -CH3, terminated SAMs, which normally exhibit a low-growth phenotype, were transfected with a constitutively active mutant form of RhoA. Subsequent cell morphological changes were observed on SAM surfaces by fluorescence microscopy. Results support surface chemistry influences on the activation state of RhoA mediated by adsorbed proteins and distinct changes in adherent cell morphology resulting from modulation of this activation state.

Upon gradual heating the enzyme in solution precipitates at 64 degrees C, whereas the encapsulated enzyme does not; it unfolds, with the nominal melting temperature of 51 +/- 3 degrees C. Even at 74.0 degrees C, the encapsulated enzyme is only similar to 77% unfolded, but it does not refold upon cooling. Upon treatment with guanidinium chloride, the degree of enzyme unfolding is 100% in solution but only similar to 83% within the silica matrix. Again, the enzyme does not refold upon removal of the denaturing agent from the glass. The glass matrix constrains the motions of the encapsulated protein molecules and prevents both their full unfolding and refolding. The former may be taken for ""stabilization"", the later for ""destabilization"" of the native conformation. Evidently, the effect of the glass on the encapsulated protein cannot be described in these general terms. The encapsulated enzyme obeys the Michaelis-Menten kinetic law as it catalyzes hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. The apparent Michaelis constant (K'(M)) is practically the same in the glass and in solution, but the apparent turnover number (k'(cat)) and specific activity for the encapsulated enzyme are only 1-2% of these values for the enzyme in solution. Because the substrate diffuses slowly into silica pores, most of the catalysis is due to the enzyme embedded near the surfaces of the glass monolith. Effect of encapsulation on structure and activity of proteins should be studied in quantitative detail before protein-doped glasses can be used as reliable biosensors, heterogeneous catalysts, and composite biomaterials.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50010 USA","Kostic, NM (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",,"Badjic, Jovica/H-9134-2013",,,,,42,81,81,0,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Ten specimens of each type (open and closed) of the three brands of elastic chains were included in the study (total of 60). All specimens were subjected to (a) optical transmission microscopy utilizing phase contrast and polarized light modes, (b) micro MIR FT-IR spectroscopy, and (c) scanning electron microscopy and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. Stretched elastomers demonstrated a honeycomb pattern of filament detachment corresponding to strained areas. The chains possessing a well-differentiated inter-modular link presented higher strain concentration gradients located in the link. Phase contrast imaging revealed that the stress adsorption mechanism of these materials involved macromolecular chain orientation and elongation co-axially to the applied load. The specimens retrieved after 24 hours had acquired a proteinaceous film rich in alcohol groups with minimal evidence of phosphate mineralization, while the 3-week retrieved specimens presented precipitation of Ca- and P-forming calcium phosphates. The high protein content of the biofilm organized on the surface of these materials, as well as the calcification pattern found, were similar to a non-specific mechanism of film adsorption of biomaterials exposed to body fluids. The results have clinical implications for aspects of retraction control through sliding mechanics with the use of elastomeric ligatures, and the potential detrimental effects on dental and periodontal tissues such as decalcification and gingival inflammation, respectively. In addition, the experimental protocols adopted for the in vitro study of the force decay of elastomerics should be modified to include parameters pertinent to adsorption phenomena and calcification processes documented to occur in vivo.","Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester M15 6FH, Lancs, England; Res Ctr Biomat, Athens, Greece","Watts, DC (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester M15 6FH, Lancs, England.",,"Eliades, Theodore/E-4959-2017","Eliades, Theodore/0000-0003-2313-4979; Watts, David/0000-0002-9105-2775",,,,22,51,56,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0141-5387,1460-2210,,EUR J ORTHODONT,Eur.

In practice, engineering strains are often used to calculate Poisson's ratio in place of the mathematically correct true strains with only very small differences resulting in the case of many engineering materials. The engineering strain definition is often used even in the inelastic region, for example, in metals during plastic yielding. However, for highly nonlinear elastic materials, such as many biomaterials, smart materials and microstructured materials, this convenient extension may be misleading, and it becomes advantageous to define a strain-varying Poisson's function. This is analogous to the use of a tangent modulus for stiffness. An important recent application of such a Poisson's function is that of auxetic materials that demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio and are often highly strain dependent. In this paper, the importance of the use of a Poisson's function in appropriate circumstances is demonstrated. Interpretation methods for coping with error-sensitive data or small strains are also described.","Univ Exeter, Dept Engn, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England","Smith, CW (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Dept Engn, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.",,"Smith, Christopher/A-3474-2009",,,,,23,50,50,3,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0014-4851,,,EXP MECH,Exp.

However, the use of these additives has some negative effects such as loss of mechanical properties, risk of release and bone resorption. The use of the monomer 2,5-diiodo-8-quinolyl methacrylate (IHQM), which shows adequate polymerization and radio-opacity properties, is proposed as a new X-ray opaque, methacrylate iodine-containing agent. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of this new radio-opaque agent on the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cements. The addition of the iodine-containing methacrylate provides a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength, fracture toughness and ductility, with respect to the barium sulphate-containing cement. This effect can be attributed to the fact that the use of a radio-opaque monomer eliminates the porosity associated with the barium sulfate particles, which show no adhesion to the matrix. However, some reinforcing effect must also be attributed to the iodine-containing monomer, since the tensile and fracture toughness values reached are even higher than those shown by the radiolucent cement.

Initial adhesion was measured using phosphate-buffered saline and subsequent surface growth of the adhering bacteria using nutrient broth as growth medium. Initial adhesion was twice as fast on the positively charged methacrylate than on the negatively charged copolymer. Surface growth, however, was absent on the positively charged copolymer, while on the negatively charged methacrylate the number of bacteria increased exponentially during surface growth with a generation time of 32 min.

Consequently, they may find a range of applications in the biomaterials field. This work evaluated the influence of HA fillers and of blowing agents (used to produce porous architectures) over the viscoelastic properties of SEVA-C polymers, as seen by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), in order to speculate on their performances when withstanding cyclic loading in the body. The composite materials presented a promising performance under dynamic mechanical solicitation conditions. Two relaxations were found being attributed to the starch and EVOH phases. The EVOH relaxation process may be very useful in vivo improving the implants performance under cyclic loading. DMA results also showed that it is possible to produce SEVA-C compact surface/porous core architectures with a mechanical performance similar to that of SEVA-C dense materials. This may allow for the use of these materials as bone replacements or scaffolds that must withstand loads when implanted.

A major problem in the measurement of protein adsorption kinetics in such systems is that the protein has to diffuse through a boundary layer to reach the surface. The thickness of such a boundary layer can be reduced by shearing the fluid phase. In the classical TIRF adsorption chamber only a unidirectional flow of buffer through the chamber is possible. In such a chamber the shear rates and shear stresses vary across the cross section and only low shear rates are obtainable. Therefore based on a rheological system for studying fluid shear stress on cultured cells a TIRF-chamber was constructed which allowed the installment of a rotating cone (max. rate: 1200 rpm) and plate viscometer-type variable shear device. In this case a flow field can be set up in which the shear rates and shear stresses are approximately constant. Cone angles (alpha) between 1.0-2.5 degrees allowed shear rates (gamma) between 0 and 7200 s(-1). The TIRF-rheometer can be employed in two different modes in the form of: (a) a closed system (no fluid flow through the rheometer chamber), (b) an open system with continuous buffer flow through the chamber. The flow conditions were checked by observing the dissolution of a small spot of dried Coomassie blue as a function of the shear rate and time. A significant secondary flow was found with all cone angles and was dependent on the square root of the shear rate. Ink injection studies demonstrate that mixing times in the chamber below two seconds are obtainable. The TIRF Rheometer thus provides a means for studying the shear dependence of the adsorption of blood proteins and the generation of thin to ultra thin boundary layers for the measurement of protein adsorption kinetics relevant to biomaterials.","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol Chem, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Munster, Inst Physiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Jennissen, HP (reprint author), Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol Chem, Hufelandstr 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,44,9,9,0,1,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Treatment options for full thickness cartilage defects are discussed in this paper. Poor biomechanical characteristics of the reparative fibrocartilage promoted by ""traditional resurfacing techniques"" provide only moderate clinical outcome in the treatment of such lesions. During the last decade several new efforts have been expressed to provide a hyaline or hyaline-like gliding surface for a full thickness defected area on the weight bearing surface. Among several surgical procedures, autologous osteochondral transplantation methods, including osteochondral mosaicplasty, chondrocyte transplantation, periosteal and perichondrial resurfacement and allograft transplantation are the favoured ""new methods"". Experimental background, operative techniques and clinical results of these new procedures are detailed in this overview. According to the early and medium term experiences of these methods it seems that a hyaline or hyaline-like resurfacement of the defected area can provide a more durable gliding surface and a better clinical outcome than the so called ""traditional resurfacing techniques"". Autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty - as an easy, one-step procedure, providing a relatively quick rehabilitation - can be an alternative in the treatment of small and medium sized lesions. Excellent clinical outcome, low costs of the treatment and short rehabilitation time represent the main advantages of this method. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be a promising option in the treatment of larger full thickness defects but requires relatively expensive two-step procedure and longer rehabilitation period. Both of the above mentioned techniques have femoral, tibial, patellofemoral and talar applications as well. According to the present recommendations transplantation of osteochondral allografts can be indicated at massive osteochondral lesions. There are less experiences with the clinical use of periosteal and perichondrial resurfacing techniques and biomaterials. Beside the promising early and medium term results of these methods the authors express that a successful treatment of the full-thickness cartilage damages of the weight bearing surfaces depends not only the way of the cartilage repair but on the treatment of the underlying cause as well. According to this statement for an effective treatment of full thickness defects on the weight bearing surfaces requires careful patient selection, complex operative plan and well organized treatment course.","Hop Uzsoki, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary","Hangody, L (reprint author), Hop Uzsoki, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Mexikoi Str 62, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary.",hangody@mail.matavnet.hu,,,,,,57,17,18,0,5,MASSON EDITEUR,MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9,"21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

A better knowledge of the HSC allows the control of their proliferation and differentiation, opening the field of ex vivo expansion. Very recently, new stem cells have been identified, establishing that a differentiated cell retain its totipotency: a nervous system cell can differentiate into HSC, which will further give hematopoiesis, mesenchymental cells or hepatocytes.

The frequency of transgenic lines established was 12%. High levels of soluble triple helical homotrimeric [(alpha 1)(3)] type I procollagen were detected (up to 8 mg/ml) exclusively in the milk of six out of 9 lines of lactating transgenic mice. The transgene-derived human procollagen chains underwent efficient assembly into a triple helical structure. Although proline or lysine hydroxylation has never been described for any milk protein, procollagen was detected with these post-translational modifications. The procollagen was stable in mil; minimal degradation was observed.

Based on transmission electron microscopy observations of glasses and glass-ceramics, a novel growth mechanism is proposed for cabbage-shaped mica crystal aggregates in machinable mica glass-ceramics. In this model, crystallization takes place along isocompositional lines at or not far from the surface of the liquid-liquid phase separation droplets. Due to high growth rates, diffusion has only little impact on the crystal growth. Finally, experimental reasons for earlier misinterpretations are discussed. (C) 1999 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

Ingrowth and organization of fibrovascular tissue inside polymer scaffolds lead to the occlusion of the regenerated blood vessel. In order to provide regulatory mechanisms to control the development of an inner capsule, endothelialization of these materials is necessary. To achieve this, we employed a novel ammonia plasma technique to surface modified PLLA substrates. Human endothelial cell (HUVEC) and rabbit microvascular endothelial cell (RbMVEC) growth was studied on modified PLLA and control PLLA. Our studies show that modified PLLA and fibronectin (Fn)-coated modified PLLA exhibited statistically significant improvement in HUVEC and RbMVEC growth (P < 0.001) when compared to PLLA and Fn-coated PLLA. Therefore, ammonia plasma treatment gives us the unique capability of modifying prosthetic biomaterials of various constructs with the eventual transplantation of mammalian cells to be used in tissue engineering or as biological implants.

It was discovered that biomolecules containing a primary amino group, secondary amino group, or hydroxyl group could be grafted into a polyurethane polymeric network via in situ polymerization reactions. With carboxyl groups, grafted material showed goon selectivity among a group of divalent metal cations, and a uranium-binding capacity of more than 10 mg/g of polymer.

A decrease in the peak temperature and an increase in the setting time was observed with the addition of the radiopaque monomer, however, the curing parameters did not appreciably change with the addition of the radiopaque compound to the solid phase. Swelling of the modified cements was in the same range as that of the radiolucent cement; however, the diffusion coefficients calculated according to the Fick's law were higher for the iodine-containing materials. The addition of 5 wt% of the iodine-containing methacrylate provided a significant increase in the tensile properties with respect to either control radiolucent formulations or BaSO4-containing formulations.

Protein adsorption on latex particles applied as model for intravenous drug carriers was analysed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The particles were incubated in citrated plasma, serum and heat-inactivated serum, respectively. Incubation in the various media resulted in clear differences in the protein adsorption patterns. Two characteristic protein spots were determined to be enriched on the 2-DE gels only after incubation of the particles in serum. Employing N-terminal microsequencing these protein spots were identified to be fragments of the complement protein C3. Enrichment of these particular spots was most likely a result of complement activation by the particles. Mechanism of C3 binding to the particle surface and subsequent inactivation by cleavage are discussed in order to explain the results. It could be demonstrated that 2-DE analysis provides the possibility to distinguish between adsorption and covalent attachment of C3 to particulate surfaces. The findings indicate that complement activation was caused by covalent binding of the C3 component C3b to the particles' surface. The influence of the incubation medium on the in vitro protein adsorption of particulate drug carriers has to be considered when a correlation between the protein adsorption pattern and the in vivo behaviour of the particles is approached.

In our work, three series of polyurethane/liquid crystal composite membranes based on three different kinds of liquid crystal compounds [N-(-4-methyoxybenzylidene)-4'-heptylaniline, 4-pentyl-4'-nitrile-biphenyl and cholesteryl oleyl carbonate] were prepared by casting on glass plates from a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of polymer and liquid crystal at room temperature. In our opinion, the formation of liquid crystal phase on the composite membrane surface is the basic requirement for getting better biomaterial. The result of this work is in accordance with our opinion. The effect of liquid crystal content on the formation of liquid crystal phase was identified by the observation of optical polarization microscopy (OPM). The results showed that the content of liquid crystal in composite membrane must be more than 30% (wt) in order to form liquid crystal phase on the composite membrane surface. The blood-compatibility of the composite membranes was assessed from SEM observation of the platelet's adhesion to membrane's surface, blood clotting time and haemolysis ratio. The observation of platelet's adhesion showed that the platelets gathered together on the pure polyurethane films, but the amount of platelets which were adherent on the surface covered by the liquid crystal phase was fewer than that of pure polyurethane film when platelet-rich plasma was allowed to be in contact with the membranes for Ih at room temperature. The determination of blood clotting time and haemolysis ratio showed that these polyurethane/liquid crystal composite membranes, in which the content of liquid crystal was more than 30% (wt), appear to be beneficial in improving the blood compatibility and reducing the thrombogenicity.

Forty four cavities were prepared in the upper lumbar vertebrae of 11 sheep using a biopsy trocar via a posterior-lateral extracanal percutaneous route and the location was monitored by radiology with a brilliance amplifier. The cavities were 3 mm in diameter. The histological study was performed on 15 cavities which were left empty to give reference data for the model. Histological and histomorphometry results showed that 67% of the surface area of the empty cavities was still empty 3 months after their preparation. Thus, the natural regenerative capacity of vertebral trabecular bone is limited. We performed preliminary percutaneous injections of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and nacre powder to assess whether this bone-defect model would be suitable for further studies on bone repair. Cavities were successfully filled with nacre powder (21 cavities) or PMMA (8 cavities) while monitoring the process by interventional radiology. The experimental sheep vertebrae defect system is reproducible and appears to be a suitable model for testing injectable biomaterials for treating bone loss. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The light-induced binding and dissociation of the biomaterials to and from the electrodes, respectively, are electronically transduced. Two systems,including the photostimulated binding and dissociation of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and of anti-DNP antibody to and from functionalized surfaces, are discussed. The application of the systems as optobioelectronic devices and reversible immunosensors is addressed. A mixed monolayer consisting of pyridine and nitrospiropyran (1a) photoisomerizable units assembled on a Au-electrode acts as a command interface for the light-controlled association and dissociation of Cyt c to and from the monolayer. Cyt c binds to the pyridine/1a-monolayer electrode, resulting in electrical contact between the redox protein and the electrode. Photoisomerization of the mixed monolayer to the pyridine/protonated merocyanine state (Ib) results in the electrostatic repulsion of Cyt c and its dissociation from the electrode support. This blocks the electrical contact between Cyt c and the electrode. By the cyclic photoisomerization of the mixed monolayer between the la and Ib states, reversible ""ON""-""OFF"" amperometric transduction of the affinity interactions between the redox protein and the interface is accomplished. Coupling of the photostimulated electrical contact between Cyt c and the electrode surface to the Cyt c-mediated bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of O-2 by cytochrome oxidase provides a means to amplify the transduced electronic signal. A photoisomerizable thiolated dinitrospiropyran (2a) monolayer, assembled on solid supports, acts as a light-active antigen interface that enables the photocontrolled binding and dissociation of anti-dinitrophenyl antibody (DNP-Ab) to and from the interface. The dinitrospiropyran (2a) layer acts as an antigen for the DNP-Ab, whereas the protonated dinitromerocyanine (2b) lacks antigen features for the DNP-Ab. By reversible photoisomerization of the monolayer between the 2a and 2b states, cyclic binding and dissociation of DNP-Ab to and from the monolayer interface is accomplished. The association and dissociation of the DNP-Ab to and from the 2a- and 2b-monolayer states are electronically transduced, using amperometric, Faradaic impedance and microgravimetric, quartz crystal microbalance analyses. The photostimulated binding of an antibody to a photoisomerizable antigen monolayer provides a novel method to design reversible immunosensor devices.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Willner, I (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",,,,,,,52,17,17,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",8756-7938,,,BIOTECHNOL PROGR,Biotechnol.

Functionally, craniosynostosis may be defined as the premature conversion of the dynamic region of growth and resorption between two adjacent bones of the cranium into a static region of bony union. Molecular analysis has blurred the traditional categories of nonsyndromic and syndromic synostosis to some extent, but, in general, the distinctions between the two groups still hold true. The complexity of the congenital anomalies may be limited with the former, whereas the latter usually requires reoperations and correction of the facial skeleton, This article briefly outlines the characteristic deformities produced from nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, Various approaches to surgical correction of the deformities are described.

Ten UCLA abutments were cast in each of 4 alloys: Type ill gold, ceramometal gold, commercially pure grade I titanium, and titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V); 10 ceramic abutments and 30 sterile Branemark System implants were also used. Five abutments of each material and 5 implants were incubated individually in rat bone marrow culture, as were 5 of each abutment attached to an implant; bone marrow cultures not containing test samples were used as controls. Following 17 days of culture, the solution potentials of individual abutments (except ceramic), the implant, and the implant-abutment couples were measured in the test medium. One dish of each group of 5 was then stained for bone nodule mineralization; the remainder were quantified by area for alkaline phosphatase staining. Statistical analysis of measured in vitro potentials showed that the uncoupled samples formed 2 groups, and coupled samples formed 3 groups. Analysis of variance for alkaline phosphatase-positive area values showed no significant differences between coupled or uncoupled groups and the control. Normal cell differentiation and morphology, as well as a lack of zones of inhibition, were observed. Bone nodule mineralization was evident in all groups. It was concluded that the presence of these commonly used implant abutment biomaterials coupled to titanium endosseous dental implants had no adverse effects on the in vitro capacity of preosteoblasts in marrow to differentiate and to form mineralized bone nodules, despite measured differences in solution potentials.","Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Prosthodont, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Natl Def Med Ctr, Canadian Forces Dent Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Halifax, NS, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Appl Oral Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Univ Maryland, Sch Dent, Adv Educ Program Prosthodont, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Taylor, JC (reprint author), 532 Montreal Rd,Suite 214, Ottawa, ON K1K 4R4, Canada.",,,,,,,57,6,6,0,5,QUINTESSENCE PUBL CO INC,CAROL STREAM,"551 NORTH KIMBERLY DR, CAROL STREAM, IL 60188-1881 USA",0882-2786,,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Anorganic bovine bone (Bio-Oss) has been reported to be osteoconductive, and no inflammatory responses have been observed with the use of this biomaterial. One of the main questions pertaining to Bio-Oss concerns its biodegradation and substitution by host bone. Some investigators have observed rapid replacement by host bone, while other researchers observed slow resorptive activity or no resorption at all. The aim of the present study was to conduct a long-term histologic analysis of retrieved specimens in humans where Bio-Oss was used in sinus augmentation procedures. Specimens were retrieved from 20 patients after varying peri ods from 6 months to 4 years and were processed to obtain thin ground sections. Bio-Oss particles were surrounded for the most part by mature, compact bone. In some Haversian canals it was possible to observe small capillaries, mesenchymal cells, and osteoblasts in conjunction with new bone. No gaps were present at the interface between the Bio-Oss particles and newly formed bone, in specimens retrieved after 18 months and 4 years, it was also possible to observe the presence of osteoclasts in the process of resorbing the Bio-Oss particles and neighboring newly formed bone. Bio-Oss appears to be highly biocompatible and osteoconductive, is slowly resorbed in humans, and can be used with success as a bone substitute in maxillary sinus augmentation procedures.","Univ G dAnnunzio, Sch Dent, Chieti, Italy; Univ Padua, Sch Dent, Padua, Italy; UCL Eastman Dent Inst Oral Hlth Care Sci, London, England","Piattelli, A (reprint author), Via F Sciucchi 63, I-66100 Chieti, Italy.",apiattelli@unich.it,"Orsini, Giovanna/B-5470-2016; Scarano, Antonio/F-6961-2017","Orsini, Giovanna/0000-0002-2641-0695; Scarano, Antonio/0000-0003-1374-6146; favero, gian antonio/0000-0002-9126-2393",,,,34,301,314,0,30,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Silanes on different PEG molecules formed covalent bonds by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation. Addition of monosilylated PEG resulted in the incorporation of dangling PEG chains, which increased the swelling ratio of the hydrogels slightly. PEG hydrogels in microspheres were prepared by emulsifying aqueous silylated PEG solution in oil followed by curing. Crosslinked PF127 hydrogels displayed inverse thermosensitivity. The previously swollen PF127 hydrogels shrank immediately at high temperatures (e.g., 60 degrees C), but the welling of shrunken hydrogels at low temperature (e.g., 5 degrees C) took much longer. The release of fluorescein from the PF127 hydrogels was dependent on the temperature of the environment. The release of fluorescein from the PF127 hydrogels was faster at 45 degrees C than at 5 degrees C. This was most likely due to shrinking of the hydrogels leading to squeezing of the incorporated fluorescein. The ability of hydrogel formation by simple sol-gel transition of silylated PEG can be used to prepare new drug delivery systems and biomaterials.","Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Park, K (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,18,2,2,1,10,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0883-9115,,,J BIOACT COMPAT POL,J.

Al though poly(NVP) is capable of absorbing relatively large amounts of water, it is not prone to hydrolysis. Yet intraocular degradation of several crosslinked poly(NVP) hydrogels has been reported recently, but some ambiguity remains about the exact mechanism of degradation of these materials. To date there is no biomaterial that combines the excellent intraocular biocompatibility on the one hand and controlled kinetics of degradation on the other hand. We attempted to design and prepare such materials through the chemical synthesis of a novel dimethacrylate crosslinker molecule. The essential feature of this molecule is that its core contains two carbonate groups, which are evidently susceptible to hydrolytic scission. We studied a series of 3-dimensional networks of poly(NVP), which were crosslinked by this molecule. This approach offers several advantages: the hydrolysis of the carbonate groups in the crosslinks leads to liberation of poly(NVP) and/or oligo(NVP) chains that can probably be cleared from the eye via phagocytosis; hydrolysis generates two alcohols and CO2 (i.e., there is no catalytic burst effect); when these materials are implanted in dry form, swelling and degradation will progress from the exterior of the material toward its interior. Therefore, these materials can be designed such that surface degradation rather than bulk degradation occurs; the hydrolysis rate can be controlled via the crosslink density or through synthesis of other crosslink molecules with either more (>2) or less (1) carbonate groups or alternatively with one or more other labile groups. We report on the chemical synthesis of the crosslinker molecule, as well, as the preparation and degradation of a series of poly(NVP)-based hydrogels in vitro and in vivo (rabbit eyes). We found that these materials indeed displayed excellent biocompatibility in the rabbit eye. Further, the experiments confirmed that degradation occurs without the burst effect. The results are in line with the idea that the rate of intraocular swelling and degradation depends on the crosslink density, but this is only a preliminary conclusion that must be strengthened by much more experimental work. Nonetheless, we foresee several applications of these or related materials in ophthalmology, for example, as biodegradable matrix materials for controlled drug delivery of ganciclovir in the vitreous body.

This study was performed to evaluate the inflammatory cell recruitment, distribution, and ex vivo metabolic activation of surfaces with different plasma protein adsorption and complement activation properties in vitro. The implants were (1) pure gold (reference), (2) albumin-precoated (3) IgG-precoated gold, and (4) 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol [mercaptoglycerol (MG)] and (5) glutathione (GSH) immobilized to gold. The implant disks were inserted subcutaneously in rats for 24 h, and the number of inflammatory cells that were recruited to the implant adjacent to the surrounding fluid phase (exudate) and the surfaces were quantified by DNA measurements. The oxidative burst was analyzed ex vivo using spontaneous and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated, luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). The in vitro surface-induced anti-rat C3 binding was evaluated by ellipsometry and antibody techniques after plasma incubations for 1 and 30 min. The ellipsometric results showed that immobilized mercaptoglycerol and IgG-coated, but not the immobilized glutathione or the reference Au, bound anti-C3. The in vivo results revealed that the largest amount of cells was associated with the IgG-coated surfaces, followed by immobilized GSH and MG, albumin-coated, and gold surfaces, respectively. No spontaneous es vivo luminol-enhanced CL was recorded from the cells irrespective of surface functionality or localization.

Crosslinking at pH 9.0 (BD90) or with successive epoxy and carbodiimide steps (BD45EN) resulted in a large increase in the shrinkage temperature (T-s) in combination with a clear reduction in amines. Crosslinking at pH 4.5 (BD45) increased the T-s of the material but hardly reduced the number of amines. Acylation (BD45HAc) showed the largest reduction in amines in combination with the lowest T-s. An evaluation of the implants showed that BD45, BD90, and BD45EN were biocompatible. A high influx of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages was observed for BD45HAc, but this subsided at day 5. At week 6 the BD45 had completely degraded and BD45HAc was remarkably reduced in size, while BD45EN showed a clear size reduction of the outer DSC bundles; BD90 showed none of these features. This agreed with the observed degree of macrophage accumulation and giant cell formation. None of the materials calcified. For the purpose of soft tissue replacement, BD90 was defined as the material of choice because it combined biocompatibility, low cellular ingrowth, low biodegradation, and the absence of calcification with fibroblast ingrowth and new collagen formation.

Setting: Central Hospital, Vaasa, and institute of Dentistry and Turku Center for Biomaterials, University of Turku, Finland. Methods: Rabbit corneal tissue cultures were set up on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), heparin-surface-modified (HSM) PMMA, silicone, acrylate, and hydrogel IOLs for 1 week. The tissue consisted of intact epithelium and half the thickness of the corneal stroma, which was placed against the IOL. The growth of the epithelium was examined by light microscopy to evaluate the attachment of the corneal explant to the IOL surface. Results: All tissue samples grew well under the culture conditions. When grown on PMMA, HSM PMMA, silicone, and hydrogel, the tissue did not attach to the IOL or the epithelium grew around the explant, suggesting that the attachment of the st,oma to the IOL was poor or nonexistent. Some explants on acrylate IOLs attached directly to the IOL surface with no epithelial ingrowth between the stroma and the IOL. Conclusions: This tissue culture method can be used to examine the behavior of corneal tissue in contact with different IOL materials. The results suggest that the acrylate IOL may have bioactive properties. This, with the lens optic's square edge, may hinder lens epithelial cell proliferation and thus prevent PCO.

In order to improve the mechanical properties and reliability of HAp based composites, the addition of selected polymers is highly recommended, The main objective of this work is to study the microstructural characteristics of HAp/poly-L-lactide (PLLA) composites obtained by cold or hot processing. The composites were prepared from a mixture of a chloroform solution of poly-L-lactide with granulated HAp. After elimination of chloroform by vacuum evaporation, dense compacts were obtained by cold or hot pressing. The pressing pressure ranged from 98.10 to 294.3 MPa for both cold and hot pressing, The hot pressing was performed in the temperature region 293-457 K for a time period of 15-60 min. Depending on the PLLA amount and the pressing procedure it is possible to obtain highly porous or nearly fully dense composites, The scanning electron microscopy examination of fracture as well as of free surfaces revealed that the final porosity and wetting are affected to a great extent by the synthesis conditions and amount of polymer added. An increase in temperature to 457 K for a longer period of time results in fully dense compacts, The formation of a nearly continuous polymer network that leads to the hardening of HAp has also been observed. However, it should be pointed out that some layers of HAp may be free of polymer film since PLLA penetrates more deeply into the porous HAp.","Serbian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Tech Sci, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Fac Technol & Met Belgrade, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Univ Nis, Univ Ctr Electron Microscopy, YU-18000 Nish, Yugoslavia; Univ Nis, Fac Elect Engn, YU-18000 Nish, Yugoslavia","Uskokovic, DP (reprint author), Serbian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Tech Sci, K Mihajlova 35-4, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia.",,"Ignjatovic, Nenad/C-4489-2008; Uskokovic, Dragan/B-4129-2008","Ignjatovic, Nenad/0000-0002-5749-094X; Uskokovic, Dragan/0000-0002-0421-4968",,,,13,42,42,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-2720,,,J MICROSC-OXFORD,J.

Because endotoxin has many of the same effects as have been reported for wear particles, we hypothesized that adherent endotoxin may be responsible for the biological responses induced by wear particles. We demonstrated the presence of significant levels of adherent endotoxin on commonly used preparations of titanium particles as well as on titanium and titanium-alloy implant surfaces. In contrast, supernatants obtained by centrifugation of particle suspensions contained approximately 1% as much endotoxin as did the particles. Therefore, it is erroneous to assume that particles do not contain endotoxin on the basis of data that it cannot be detected in their supernatants or filtrates. These results emphasize the importance of considering the potential role of adherent endotoxin when examining the in vitro effects of wear particles and the in vivo performance of orthopaedic implants. We also developed a protocol that removed more than 99.94% of the adherent endotoxin from the titanium particles without detectably affecting their size or shape. The removal of adherent endotoxin will allow comparison of the biological responses induced by particles with or without adherent endotoxin.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Greenfield, EM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR07505, AR43769]",,,54,137,140,1,8,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

For this purpose, (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid (H-AMPB-OH) and (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid (H-APB-OH) were synthesized and used to cyclize a bis-cysteinyl-octapeptide giving monocyclic derivatives in which additional conformational restriction could be introduced by conversion to bicyclic structures with a disulphide bridge. While synthesis with H-AMPB-OH proceeded smoothly on a chlorotrityl-resin with Fmoc/tBu chemistry, the poor nucleophilicity of the arylamino group of H-APB-OH required special chemistry for satisfactory incorporation into the peptide chain. Additional difficulties were encountered in the reductive cleavage of the S-tert-butylthio group from the cysteine residues since concomitant reduction of the azobenzene moiety took place at competing rates. This difficulty was eventually bypassed by using the S-trityl protection. Side-chain cyclization of the APE-peptide proved to be difficult, suggesting that restricted conformational freedom was already present in the monocyclic form, a fact that was fully confirmed by NMR structural analysis. Conversely, the methylene spacer in the AMPB moiety introduced sufficient flexibility for facile and quantitative side-chain cyclization to the bicyclic form. Both of the monocyclic peptides and both of the bicyclic peptides are photoresponsive molecules which undergo cis/trans isomerization reversibly.

Emission maxima for H2O2 and cumene-OOH were 670 nm, and emission maxima for MEK-OOH and tert-BuOOH were at 510 nm. The photon intensity from the gallic acid lipoxygenase system corresponded to the linoleic acid hydroperoxide value. A high correlation of photon intensity with hydroperoxide, including linoleic hydroperoxide was useful as a simple and sensitive method for the direct detection of hydroperoxides in biomaterials.

An alternative to synthetic materials would be a biomaterial that could be used in the design of a tissue-engineered graft. We demonstrate that a small-diameter (4 mm) graft constructed from a collagen biomaterial derived from the submucosa of the small intestine and type I bovine collagen has the potential to integrate into the host tissue and provide a scaffold for remodeling into a functional blood vessel. The results obtained using a rabbit arterial bypass model have shown excellent hemostasis and patency.

The possibility of inhibiting the initial adhesion of neutrophils to biomaterials has been studied extensively, but the problem remains unsolved. In this study, we investigated the effect of HK adsorption on polyurethane, a widely used component of extracorporeal and intracorporeal devices. HK and HKa were allowed to adsorb on 4 different charged polyurethanes: noncharged (PU), cationic (NR4), anionic (SO3), and zwitterionic (GPC) polyurethanes. The effect of kininogen adsorption on neutrophil adhesion, the surface density of the adsorbed kininogen, and the exposure of HK domains 3 and 5 (D-3 and D-5H) which are responsible for the binding of HK to the neutrophil integrin alpha(m)beta(2) or Mac-1, were examined. On PU, NR4, and SO3, kininogen adsorption reached 80% of monolayer coverage when 100 pmol/mL or higher concentration of protein solutions were used. The NR4 surface adsorbed the most kininogen along with a high exposure of D-3 and D-5H. The availability of D-3 and D5H allowed neutrophils to bind to the surface via the Mac-1 receptor; thus, on the NR4 surface, adsorbed kininogens lost their antiadhesive property, which resulted in a high degree of neutrophil adhesion. Increasing Mac-1 expression by exposure to fMLP increased the neutrophil adhesion on this surface. In contrast, exposure of D-3 and D-5H on SO3 was significantly less, because HK binds to anionic surfaces with similar protein sequences used for cell binding. This low binding site exposure preserved the antiadhesive property of HK. GPC was resistant to neutrophil adhesion even in the absence of adsorbed kininogens because of its phosphorylcholine moiety.

However, before these PPy-coated materials can be investigated for their capacity to generate endothelialized luminal surfaces, they must first be studied for their innocuousness in a living environment. The specific goal of the present study was to investigate the in vivo interactions of PPy-coated and noncoated woven polyester materials implanted subcutaneously in rats for prescheduled periods of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days. The in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times were computed for a small area of muscle tissue adjacent to the implants. A correlation was concurrently attempted with blood monocyte activation studies as well as histological observations of the tissue-material interface. The progressive pattern of the slower transversal relaxation time (T-2s) values revealed a more persistent tissue reaction for the most conductive PPy-coated materials and a shorter acute tissue response as the surface resistivity increased. Similarly, the blood monocyte activation studies indicated that the thickness of the PPy coating, which correlated with the conductivity, was directly related to tissue response. Furthermore, both the MR and biological studies showed that the PPy-coated material with a high surface resistivity displayed the lowest tissue reaction over the entire period of implantation. The results obtained from the blood monocyte activation studies and histological observations correlate well with the noninvasive MR measurements of the body's healing process. The conductive materials with high surface resistivities must be further investigated. Finally, the noninvasive nature of MR relaxometry reveals its outstanding potential for future in vivo investigations of the body's tissue interactions with polymers and nonferromagnetic biomaterials.","Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Quebec Biomat Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Rheumatol & Immunol Res Ctr, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,52,19,20,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

One hydroxyapatite ceramic (S-HA), macroporous implants with rough pore walls containing abundant micropores, was made by Sichuan Union University (Chengdu, China); the other hydroxyapatite ceramic (J-HA), porous implants with smooth macropore walls composed of regularly aligned crystal grains, was provided by Mitsubishi Ceramic Int. (Japan). Different tissue response was detected histologically and microradiographically after the ceramic samples had been implanted in dorsal muscles of dogs for 3 and 6 months. Bone formation was found in S-HA at 3 months, which increased at 6 months. In contrast, no bone formation was detected in J-HA at both 3 and 6 months. These results indicate that with the special architecture, calcium phosphate ceramic can induce bone formation in soft tissue. As both materials were very similar in their chemical and crystallographic structures, but varied in their microstructures, the latter seem to be an important factor affecting the osteoinductive capacity of calcium phosphate ceramics. These data suggest that, by controlling the preparation of calcium phosphate ceramic, bone substitutes with intrinsic osteoinductive property can be developed from calcium phosphates.

However, contraction or detachment of the capsule can lead to complications. Biocompatibility of biomaterials may be improved by the application of proteins regulating the differentiation or activation of(myo)fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, differentiating from fibroblasts can be identified by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SM actin). We investigated the influence of proliferation and quiescence on the differentiation of porcine dermal cells and whether transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in the differentiation of proliferating cells. Porcine cells were used because pigs increasingly function as in vivo models while little is known of the characteristics of their cells. Serum-free cultured, quiescent fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, while proliferating fibroblasts cultured in the presence of serum containing TGF-beta, formed alpha-SM actin-negative cell clusters. After reaching confluency, these clusters started to expressing alpha-SM actin. Moreover, these proliferating cells produced TGF-beta from day 4 onwards while bFGF did not. Differentiation into myofibroblasts was inhibited by bFGF and to an even greater extent by antibodies to TGF-beta. Further, two theories concerning the role of the myofibroblast in tissue contraction in view of two biomaterial application will be discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The reliability of the estimation by fluorescence image analysis was validated by comparison with visual counting and with results obtained by an electronic particle counter. In this way it was possible to demonstrate that the adhesive properties of bone cells are dependent on the type of substrate-enstatite (MgO, SiO2, CaO-P2O5-Al2O3), Thermanox(R) (modified polyethyleneterephthalate), or glass. In contrast, the spread of the cell cytoplasm, labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and measured by image analysis, does not vary significantly according to the substrate. The characterisation by SKIZ tessellation of the spatial cell arrangement shows that the bone cells have a random organisation on Thermanox(R) and glass, whereas they form aggregates on enstatite.

The new approach essentially rests upon photochemical immobilisation of the highly biocompatible polymer poly(N-vinylpyrrolidinone) (poly(NVP)) onto the biomaterial's surface. One of the key steps in the surface modification procedure is the preparation of a copolymer of NVP and the photoreactive building block 4-[4'-azidobenzoyl]-oxo-n-butylmethacrylate (1). This copolymer is first dissolved in a volatile solvent, then sprayed onto the biomaterial's surface, and subsequently immobilised via irradiation with ultraviolet light. The paper describes: (i) preparation of 1, (ii) preparation of the copolymer (NVP + 1), (iii) physico-chemical characterisation of the modified surfaces, and (iv) results of two in vitro haemocompatibility assays (i.e. thrombin generation and adhesion of blood platelets from recalcified human platelet-rich plasma). Furthermore, the surface modification was performed with a microporous polyurethane vascular graft (Chronoflex (R)), which is already in clinical use. The in vitro experiments revealed that significant improvement of the haemocompatibility of polyurethanes can be achieved through this method. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The most frequent causes are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Several studies have been devoted to identify adhesion mechanisms for these bacteria. Slime in particular has been extensively investigated. Recently, in Staphylococcus aureus species, considerable attention has been given to the host protein receptors that have been shown in in vitro assays to serve as substrates for bacterial adhesion. Collagen-rich tissues, as bone and cartilage, that are the preferential sites of staphylococcal infections, are also the tissues that harbour orthopaedic implants. These can be easily coated in vivo by collagen and thus become prone to adhesion of Staphylococci strains which carry the collagen adhesin gene (cna). In this study the frequency of cna was determined within a collection of 35 Staphylococcus aureus strains from orthopaedic prosthesis infections by a PCR method. Also the collagen-binding ability and slime forming capacity was evaluated. 29% of the strains were cna-positive and also able to bind collagen in vitro. 83% of the strains were slime forming. The results indicate that in the examined bacterial population slime-positive strains predominate over the cna-positive strains, with a striking association of the two adhesion mechanisms in cna-positive strains.

The promising area of tissue engineering represents a multidisciplinary approach aimed at solving some of the most perplexing biologic problems, namely, the creation of new tissues and organs similar to the original tissues and organs. In addition, strategies using new synthetic polymer formulations can facilitate tissue replacement and represent alternatives to tissue regeneration in certain conditions. Although biotechnology has broad application over many medical specialties, orthopaedics is receiving a large focus of the research effort devoted to techniques for developing bone, articular cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Because bioengineered tissue and/or techniques to stimulate tissue regeneration soon may be used clinically, orthopaedic surgeons should have a working knowledge of the basic concepts involved. Terms, such as biomaterial, biotechnology, matrices of synthetic or biologic polymers or both, adhesion, cohesion, porosity, induction, conduction, stem cell, progenitor cell, mesenchymal cell, tissue growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, mitogenic and chemotactic factors, and numerous other terms will become part of the working language of clinicians of the twenty-first century.","So Calif Ctr Sports Med, Long Beach, CA USA","Jackson, DW (reprint author), 2760 Atlantic Ave, Long Beach, CA 90806 USA.",,,,,,,35,40,40,1,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Little is known, however, about the contributions of these novel repair strategies to restoration of normal meniscal function. Biomechanical factors play a role in the design and synthesis of tissue engineered biomaterials and bioreactors, and also are important for evaluating the efficacy of these new strategies for restoring normal meniscal function. In this report, an overview Is presented of biomechanical factors that are critical to meniscal function followed by a review of biomechanical considerations for the design and evaluation of tissue engineered strategies for meniscal repair.

Catheter thrombogenicity was evaluated in humans during angiographic procedures by their tendency to become occluded. Characterization of catheters was achieved using roughness measurements, FTIR with ATR, DSC and ESCA. The catheters were 5 commercially available catheters, made mainly of polyethylene, Pebaux(R) or polyamide sterilized and ready for clinical use. Thirty-one patients due to have an angiographic procedure and with normal blood and hemodynamic parameters were included in the study. The 50 cm catheter test sample was inserted through an introducer into the femoral artery at the beginning of an angiographic procedure. The outcoming blood flow rate (BFR) was continuously monitored by a special computerized device for 15 min or until the total amount of blood reached 30 ml. The angiographic procedure was then normally resurned. DSC and FTIR showed results consistent with the expected composition of catheters. ESCA results showed very high Si/C ratios and could not be explained in all instances. Occlusion of the catheters occurred in 44 % of the cases and the average time to obtain occlusion was 8.5 min (3-15 min). Values of the decrease rate of BFR in ml/min(2) allowed separate of the catheters into 3 groups of low, medium and high thrombogenicity. However, occlusion occurred at least one time for each type of catheter. Blood volume and BFR curves vs. time allowed the determination of 3 main types of thrombotic behavior: type I shows no significant reduction of BFR; type II shows a progressive decrease in flow rate; type III is much less frequent and shows an abrupt decrease of BFR either quickly followed by a compensatory increase and resuming of a steady flow or by abrupt occlusion. in type N curves the pattern of occlusion follows a classical diffusion model because the Peclet number is greater than I and then the classical Higble solution for diffusion could be used (33). The most thrombogenic material was the smoothest. There was no correlation between surface chemical composition and thrombogenicity. However, catheters that were based on PE appeared less thrombogenic than PA catheters in this study.","Univ Paris 11, Ctr Etud Pharmaceut, Lab Biomat & Polymers, URM 8612, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; Claude Bernard Res Fund, Lab Neuroradiol & Therapeut Angiog, Paris, France; Hop St Francois Assise, Inst Biomat Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Lab Biorheol Hydrodynam & Physiochem, Paris, France","Lautier, A (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, Ctr Etud Pharmaceut, Lab Biomat & Polymers, URM 8612, 5 Rue JB Clement, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France.",,,,,,,44,8,8,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0391-3988,1724-6040,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

As these applications involve surgical insertion of gels, the effect of cross-linking on mechanical properties is relevant. The effect of cross-linking on the gel water uptake is also relevant for the kinetics of drug release. Equally important is the influence of initial amounts of gelatin in the gelling solutions. We investigated the influence of cross-linking (with glutaraldehyde) and of gelatin content upon the equilibrium water content and tensile properties of resulting gels. A range of gels was prepared with gelatin contents of 10 to 40% wt, and cross-linked with 2.5 to 50% wt glutaraldehyde. The increase in gelatin content and degree of cross-linking reduced the water uptake of gels from about 60-65% wt to about 50% wt. The tensile characteristics were differentially affected. While the increase of cross-linking induced a decrease of toughness and elasticity and an increase of stiffness, it did not affect the ultimate strength of gels. On the contrary, the increase of gelatin content induced a definite increase of the ultimate strength but did not significantly affect the other properties.","Univ Western Australia, Dept Biomat & Polymer Res, Lions Eye Inst, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Ctr Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",,,"Lou, Xia/A-7333-2010","Lou, Xia/0000-0002-4052-8200",,,,23,32,34,3,18,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0885-3282,,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

As there is no effective method currently available to prevent such biomaterials from calcifying, a practical solution is to use only materials with a relatively high resistance to calcification, to extend ventricular durability and ensure a longer functional life for the manufactured device. In the present study, an in vitro calcification protocol was used to determine the relative resistance to calcification of six different polyurethanes, namely, Carbothane(R) PC3570A, Chronoflex(R) AR, Corethane(R) 80A, Corethane(R) 55D, Tecoflex(R) EG80A, and Tecothane(R) TT1074A, The results demonstrated that all sis polyurethanes did become calcified during the 60-day incubation period in the calcification solution, The degree of calcification was found to be associated,vith the surface chemistry of the particular polyurethane, with the Tecothane TT1074A exhibiting the highest level. The Corethane 80A and 55D polymers showed a relatively low propensity to calcify. These two membranes can, therefore, be considered as the most appropriate materials for the fabrication of ventricles for a totally implantable artificial heart. In addition, since the calcification occurred primarily at the surface of the membranes, without affecting the bulk microphase structure, the issue of modifying the surface chemistry to reduce the incidence of calcification is discussed.

Macrophages phagocytose orthopedic debris and release the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2. In addition, other immunologic-agents, such as interferon-gamma, are present in tissues harvested from the bone-implant interface of failed orthopedic implants. The present study examined the effects of interferon-gamma on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particle-challenged monocyte/macrophages in vitro. The effects of interferon-gamma were determined by measuring interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release by primary human monocyte/macrophages following exposure to PMMA particles. Exposure of the monocyte/macrophages to PMMA particles resulted in a dose-dependent release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at 48 h. The interleukin-6 release in response to PMMA particle challenge was stimulated by 76% and 127% in the presence of 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL of interferon-gamma, respectively. Interferon-gamma challenge alone did not alter interleukin-6 release relative to controls. In contrast to interleukin-6, interferon-gamma challenge stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha release in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of particles, addition of 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL of interferon-gamma resulted in 17% and 171% increases in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, respectively, relative to cultures challenged solely with particles. Blocking antibody to IFN-gamma inhibited the effect of IFN-gamma on particle-induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release. The data presented in this study demonstrate that the immunologic modulator interferon-gamma exacerbates monocyte/macrophage release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to PMMA particle challenge in vitro.

Polymyxin B (PMB) is a polypeptidic antibiotic which undergoes thermodamage above 60 degrees C. The dynamic compaction method was developed to consolidate the drug load on CaP powder without external heating. Two projectile velocities (50 and 25 m/s) were used here to achieve powder consolidation. Among the different techniques used to associate therapeutic agents with CaP, wet adsorption was performed before the dynamic compaction process. The PMB release profile was measured by a capillary electrophoresis technique, CaP crystallography was studied by x-ray diffraction, and Cap physicochemical analysis was performed by infrared spectroscopy. The biological activities of PMB-loaded compacted CaP were determined by the effect of the antibiotic and monocyte/macroyhage degradation on compact surfaces. PMB release began after 2-3 days of incubation for blocks compacted at 25 m/s velocity and on day 5 for those compacted at 50 m/s velocity, a discrepancy was noted between the amounts of PMB released (0.5-2.1 mg) and the amounts initially compacted (2-8 mg) with CaP powder.

Thus, dynamic compaction allows PMB to be used with Cap ceramics without any loss in its integrity and biological effects.

These biomaterials were obtained by associating a biphasic calcium-phosphate (BCP) ceramic mineral phase with a 3% aqueous solution of a cellulosic polymer (hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose). Both materials were injected for periods of 2, 3, 8, or 12 weeks into bone defects at the distal end of rabbit femurs. Quantitative results on new bone formation, BCP resorption, and staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity were studied for statistical purposes. Measurements with scanning electron microscopy and image analysis showed that the final rates of newly formed bone were similar for both tested IBS after 12 weeks of implantation. Bone colonization occurred more extensively during early implantation times for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500. For the latter, BCP degradation occurred regularly throughout the implantation period, whereas it was very intensive during the first 2 weeks for IBS 40-80. Positive TRAP-stained degradation cells were significantly more numerous for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500 regardless of implantation time. With the granulometry of either mineral phase, both tested IBS supported extensive bone colonization, which was greater than that previously reported for an equivalent block of macroporous DCP. The resorption-bone substitution process seemed to occur earlier and faster for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500. Both tested IBS expressed similar biological efficiency, with conserved in vivo bioactivity and bone-filling ability.

To find new synthetic absorbable polymers with plastic nature that can be used as BMP-carrier materials, six types of poly-D,L-lactic acid-polyethylene glycol block copolymer (PLA-PEG) with various molecular weights of PLA and PEG were synthesized. These were PLA6,500-PEG3,000 (P-1), PLA11,500-PEG3,000 (P-2), PLA17,500-PEG3,000 (P-3), PLA6,500-PEG1,000 (P-4), PLA15,000-PEG8,000 (P-5), and PLA8,500-PEG1,000 (P-6). Fifty milligrams of these polymers was mixed with 0 mu g (control) or 5, 10, or 20 mu g of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2). These pellets were implanted into the dorsal muscle pouches of 144 mice (six pellets consisting of the same polymer and dose of rhBMP-2 for a specific group). Three weeks aft-er surgery, the pellets were harvested and examined by radiographic and histological methods. All P-1 pellets with 10 or 20 mu g of rhBMP-2 showed bone formation with hematopoietic marrow and bony trabeculae, as did one third of those with 5 mu g of rhBMP-2. The incidence of new bone formation with P-2 pellets or that of P-5 pellets was lower than that of P-1 pellets. No bone was formed in any other type of pellet. These results indicated that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 polymer with plastic properties was found to work well as a BMP carrier.

Endothelial cell cultures represent a valuable tool not just in haemocompatibility testing, but also in the concept of designing hybrid organs. In the past endothelial cells (EC) have frequently been used in cytotoxicity testing of materials, especially polymers, used in blood-contacting implants, as well as for investigating seeding technologies for vascular prostheses. At present the exponential development both in theory and practice of cell and molecular biology of the endothelium offers great promise in the biomaterial field. Up until now this EC research field has mostly been non-biomaterial orientated. Nevertheless, the relevance for biomaterial research is apparent. Four aspects will be concisely reviewed under the headings inflammation, with special reference to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and cytokines, angiogenesis, focusing on the healing response, signal transduction, presenting examples from cytokine- and metal ion-induced up-regulation of genes coding for CAMs, and, finally, endothelial functionality, with emphasis on the principal characteristics of the physiological endothelial phenotype. Finally, the application of these fields to three foci of biomaterial research will be discussed, emphasizing the role of EC culture techniques in controlling the host response to biomaterials (microvascular EC), controlling EC functionality (promoting positive effects and down-regulating negative effects), and tissue engineering (integration of EC into hybrid organs/biosensors). The need for more co-culture and three-dimensional models will be stressed and data from the authors' laboratory presented to illustrate these principles.

In an attempt to understand some of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of the control of cell differentiation in the presence of two different materials, Chronoflex (CH) and plasma treated Chronoflex coated with Hyaluronan (CH-HA), we used primary cultures of human myogenic cells, a model that encompasses cell proliferation, migration, fusion, and differentiation dependent gene activation. By testing both the material samples on the growth of human myoblasts in primary cultures, we demonstrated that both CH and CH-HA substrates were able to support the cell growth since they did not affect cell count and DNA synthesis. On the contrary, the degree of myoblast differentiation, assessed as a function of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity on living cells, was completely different on the two biomaterials. Indeed, the amount of CPK increased on CH-HA cultured cells as a result of myotube formation, while CH grown myoblasts remained unfused and displayed no increase on the CPK activity even after 12 days culture. Moreover, the expression level of MyoD and myogenin mRNA, both related to myogenic cell differentiation, appeared extremely low in CH-grown cells, while they were rapidly induced in CH-HA cultured myoblasts.

In this paper, several in vitro and in vivo techniques are presented to demonstrate means of delineating a part of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between biomaterial and macrophage adhesion and phenotypic development. The following conclusions were reached: (1) using radioimmunoassay, complement component C3 was found to be critical in mediating human macrophage adhesion on polyurethanes. (2) The presence of a diphenolic antioxidant additive in polyurethanes increased the propensity for complement upregulation but did not affect adherent macrophage density. (3) The subcutaneous cage-implant system was utilized to delineate interleukin-4 participation in the fusion of adherent macrophages to form foreign body giant cells in vivo in mice. The injection of purified interleukin-4 neutralizing antibody into the implanted cages significantly decreased the giant cell density; conversely, the giant cell density was significantly increased by the injection of recombinant interleukin-4 when compared with the controls. (4) The RGD and PHSRN amino acid sequences of the central cell binding domain and the PRRARV sequence of the C-terminal heparin binding domain of human plasma fibronectin were utilized to study the structure-functional relationship of protein in mediating macrophage behavior. Polyethyleneglycol-based networks grafted with the RGD-containing peptide supported higher adherent human macrophage density than surfaces grafted with other peptides. The formation of foreign body giant cell was highly dependent on the relative orientation between PHSRN and RGD domains located in a single peptide.

In vitro models include the use of bone explant cultures, fetal rat calvarial-derived osteoblast cells, primary stromal populations, transformed and non-transformed cell lines and immortalized osteoblast cell lines. However, these assessments are limited by the extent of osteogenic differentiation and bone formation that can be observed in vitro, species differences and phenotypic drift of cells cultured in vitro. The use of in vivo experimental systems such as the segmental/calvarial bone defect model, the subcutaneous implant model and the diffusion chamber implantation model circumvent some of these issues and, in the appropriate model, provide data on efficacy, biocompatibility and osteointegration of a biomaterial. The combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches together with the development of new cell labeling techniques, in particular the ability to genetically mark and select specific human bone cell populations provides new avenues for their potential evaluation in combination with appropriate biomaterials for clinical use. These in vitro and in vivo techniques are reviewed and those recently developed for assessment of human osteogenic cells should be applicable to many other cell systems where knowledge of specific human tissue or cell interactions with biomaterials is required.

This paper describes the development of a series of clinically reflective in vitro assays for assessing the potential ocular compatibility of novel intraocular lens materials. Staphylococcus epidermidis attachment, fibrinogen adsorption, mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 adhesion and proliferation, primary rabbit lens cell adhesion, human peripheral blood macrophage adhesion and granulocyte activation tests were employed to evaluate two widely used intraocular biomaterials poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone, and a novel biomimetic phosphorylcholine-based coating (PC). The performance of these materials in the in vitro assays was compared to their ability to reduce postoperative inflammation in vivo in a rabbit model. The results demonstrated that the in vitro assays described here are predictive of in vivo ocular compatibility. These assays offer a more relevant means of assessing the ocular compatibility of biomaterials than those presently required by the authorities for regulatory approval of medical devices and implants.

In this study, we address the use of a degradable gelatin DDS, for the combined release of therapeutic levels of both gentamicin and growth hormone (GH). An initial bolus release was observed during the first 24 h followed by a reduced, but sustained, release for both drugs up to 14 days. Bioactivity of gentamicin was demonstrated by growth inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus for over 96 h with a mean zone of inhibition of 29.4 mm (+/- 0.19) for the time period studied. Furthermore, GH was shown to have a direct effect on primary human osteoblast-like (HOB) cells, stimulating proliferation and enhancing their differentiation. Site-specific drug delivery offers the advantage of localizing a drug directly at the target site, thus minimizing systemic effects. The results of this study suggest that gelatin is a good DDS for the combined release of drugs. In addition, gelatin is both biocompatible and biodegradable, thus making it a promising DDS for the management of acute and chronic bone and tissue infection such as osteomyelitis.

The availability of appropriate biomaterial devices is essential to allow in vitro cultured cells to behave as in the original tissues in vivo. In our studies we utilized a seminatural biomaterial made up by the benzyl ester of hyaluronan to grow keratinocytes, fibroblasts and chondrocytes. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were isolated from human foreskin. Cells were separately cultured on two different hyaluronan based biomaterial devices for the first 15 days and then co-cultured for an additional period of 2 weeks. Keratinocytes gave rise to a well-differentiated epithelial layer, while fibroblasts were able to synthesize all the main extracellular molecules inside the biomaterial spaces, forming dermal-like tissues. When these two tissues were co-cultured, a skin equivalent was formed with a dermal-epidermal junction. Chondrocytes were obtained from chick-embryo sterna and cultured for 21 days inside a non-woven scaffolding made up of a hyaluronan-based biomaterial. Cells were able to organize themselves into nodules embedded in a dense metachromatic substance in which type II collagen was present. Data from this study suggest that this novel class of hyaluronan derived biomaterials is suitable for different cell culture and in vitro tissue reconstruction.

Critical limitations inherent in traditional therapies call for novel tissue and organ replacement strategies. This paper discusses development of biomaterials for conductive, inductive and cell-based tissue replacement strategies. Biodegradable polymer scaffolds can be used as space-filling matrices for tissue development and barriers to migration of epithelial cells in tissue conductive approaches. Inductive approaches involve sustained delivery of bioactive factors, such as protein growth factors and DNA, to alter cell function in localized regions. Factors can be released from highly porous polymer scaffolds to allow factor delivery and tissue development to occur in concert. Cell-based approaches involve seeding of cells onto polymeric scaffolds in vitro and subsequent transplantation of the scaffold. New scaffold materials are being developed that address specific tissue engineering design requirements, and in some cases attempt to mimic natural extracellular matrices. These strategies together offer the possibility of predictably forming specific tissue structures, and may provide solutions to problems such as periodontal ligament detachment, alveolar bone resorption and furcation defects.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Mooney, DJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, 2300 Hayward St,3074 HH Dow Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Murphy, William/I-4096-2014",,,,,50,84,88,1,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0022-3484,,,J PERIODONTAL RES,J.

For this report, the Gemini, a new sampling device for Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflection (HATR) and Diffuse Reflectance (DR) FTIR spectroscopy was evaluated as an option for the study of bovine hides, in successive stages of chrome tanning. Specifically, raw, pickled and chrome sulfate-treated bovine hides were subjected to HATR FTIR analysis so that changes in collagen structure as a function of chemical treatment could be observed. Also, freeze dried hides were examined by DR FTIR in order to detect the presence and structure of collagen-chromium complexes. Comparisons of HATR and DR FTIR show that the expected chemical changes in the hide can be observed. The quality of the spectra obtained is comparable to that reported by biomedical research groups. The GEMINI shows excellent versatility for in-processing hide sampling, enabling the detailed study of many truly unique chemical and biochemical phenomena of the tanning process.","Texas Tech Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; Texas Tech Univ, Leather Res Inst, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; ARS, USDA, Eastern Reg Res Ctr, Wyndmoor, PA 19038 USA","Shelly, DC (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",,,,,,,14,6,6,0,4,AMER LEATHER CHEMISTS ASSN,CINCINNATI,"ROOM 5 CAMPUS STATION-14 TANNER RES LAB, CINCINNATI, OH 45221 USA",0002-9726,,,J AM LEATHER CHEM AS,J.

However, in some applications it is necessary to treat ultra-fine sub-micron particles that have been purposely aggregated to increase their apparent size in order to make centrifugal separation feasible. For some time the possibility of processing of slurries containing aggregates (eg ceramics, minerals, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, biomaterials, etc) has been considered doubtful since it was presumed that shear forces within the hydrocyclone would tend to render such operations ineffective by breaking up the aggregates. The complex mechanisms involved in the separation of aggregates have not allowed a clear understanding of the breakage-separation process, and no model has been available that considers the breakage and separation of particles simultaneously. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of processing dilute suspensions of aggregates using small diameter hydrocyclones by presenting a critical assessment of previous work, and new experimental measurements employing in-situ particle size, density and mass flow measurements for the process streams coupled with robust data reconciliation procedures. A model to describe the breakage-separation phenomenon is proposed and tested. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cells growing from 4 days after subculture (DAS) to 9 DAS and from 16 DAS to 19 DAS showed a diauxic growth, and then growth rapidly decreased with further culturing. The AsA content slowly increased to 19 DAS, reached a maximum at 21 DAS (ca 120 mu g/g dry cell mt), and then rapidly decreased with further culturing. GLDase and ASO activity were well correlated with the cell growth curve, showing a maximum at 19 DAS, whereas APX activity showed a good correlation with the changes in AsA content, showing a maximum at 21 DAS, The total ascorbate contents (reduced form, AsA, and oxidized form, dehydroascorbate, DHA) were markedly enhanced at 10 DAS when L-galactose and L-galactono-1,4-lactone (25 mM) were added to SH medium supplemented with 20 g/l sucrose at 9 DAS, by 5.5 and 6.8 times, respectively.

In addition, 2D macromolecular ordering is of fundamental interest in the areas of phase behavior and complex fluids. Our work involves the growth of 2D streptavidin crystals to examine protein self-assembly at an interface. Streptavidin molecules bound to a biotinylated lipid monolayer self-assemble into ordered arrangements, creating 2D crystals with distinct macroscopic morphologies and lattice configurations. In this paper, we highlight previous work examining the effects of intermolecular interactions on molecular organization and macroscopic properties in ordered protein arrays. We also describe our recent progress using streptavidin mutants to study specific protein-protein interactions and their effects on crystal properties. We show that specific changes in intermolecular interactions give alternate morphological, crystallographic, and thermodynamic properties in ordered monolayers. We introduce an additional growth direction in a crystal with oblique P1 symmetry by engineering extra hydrogen bonds. These extra interactions kinetically trap the crystal in a less-ordered paracrystalline state; however, a solid-solid phase transition to the more-ordered, thermodynamically favored form occurs over time. Removal of this interaction enables molecules to directly form the more-ordered P1 configuration. The introduction of repulsive forces at this site inhibits P1-crystal formation such that crystals with P2 symmetry grow at conditions normally resulting in P1 crystals. Our results confirm that macrosopic and microscopic changes in 2D crystalline properties can be elicited by selectively altering specific intermolecular interactions. Such specific engineered alterations are useful in producing desired crystals and to further our understanding of protein interactions and assembly.","Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gast, AP (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,89,19,19,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5647,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

This model combines the effects of cells (macrophages), transition metal ions (Fe2+), and polymer stress to promote material biodegradation. The cell and material effects of DEX, either in solution or incorporated into a polyetherurethane matrix (DEX/PEU), were monitored. Cell morphology and hydroperoxide formation in the polymer during cell culturing were characterized. After a subsequent treatment with FeCl2 the development of environmental stress cracking in the polymer was evaluated. We attempted to duplicate the biodegradation of PEU in terms of environmental stress cracking (ESC). Our results support the direct involvement of macrophages in polyetherurethane oxidation, probably by inducing hydroperoxide formation in the polymer structure. Under the influence of stress or strain, polymers with sufficient hydroperoxides degrade in the presence of Fe2+ metal ions in a manner that closely resembles the stress cracking that is observed in vivo. By contrast, polymers treated with either agents that inhibit cell activation and/or the oxidative burst, or with cells with no oxidative burst did not show signs of the biodegradative process. We demonstrated a reduction in hydroperoxide formation and no later ESC development in macrophage-cultured PEU in the presence of DEX in solution or in DEX-loaded PEU. We believe the prevention of initial polymer oxidation by reducing the cell's potential to produce oxidative stress at the tissue-biomaterial interface can directly inhibit the ESC degradation of chronically implanted polymers. The in vitro macrophage-Fe-stress system is a valuable tool for reliable assessment and cost-effective evaluation of biomaterials.

Using a rotating disk system, we investigated Staphylococcus epidermidis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to a polyetherurethane urea (PEUU-A') under shear stress (0-17.5 dynes/cm(2)) for time periods up to 6 h. In addition, the superoxide (SO) release capacity of PMNs after transient exposure to PEUU-A' under shear stress was determined. Bacterial adhesion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed a linear shear dependence, decreasing with increasing shear stress. Overall adhesion in PBS decreased with time. However, bacterial adhesion in 25% human serum was similar for all time points up to 360 min. Adhesion was observed at all shear levels, displaying no shear dependence. In contrast, PMN adhesion demonstrated a strong shear dependence similarly for times up to 240 min, decreasing sharply with increasing shear stress. Although PMNs preexposed to shear stress showed a slightly diminished SO release response compared to fresh cells for all stimuli, it was not statistically significant regardless of the stimulus. We conclude that circulating leukocytes are unable to adhere in regions of high shear which may contain adherent bacteria. In addition, exposure to PEUU-A' and shear stress (in the range 0-18 dynes/cm(2)) is insufficient to cause a depression in the oxidative response of PMNs.

In many cases it is not sufficient to just have the three-dimensional structure of a protein in H2O or in the crystalline state. Often information on the structural properties of a protein is required in the presence of organic solvents, detergent micelles, phospholipid membranes and so on. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been identified as one of the few techniques that can be applied for structural characterisation of proteins in such environments. Here we discuss how this technique is being used to obtain information on protein structure and stability in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. Examples are drawn from our studies of water soluble proteins and membrane proteins. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The changes in molecular weights and thermal properties of PDLLA were studied as a function of the superoxide ion concentration, hydrolysis time, and hydrolysis temperature. The superoxide ion induced fragmentation of PDLLA yielded a mixture of various species with different chain length. A combined size exclusion chromatography (SEC) method with a chemical tagging by phenyl isocyanate revealed that the structure of the oligomer species with the lowest molecular weight formed in the superoxide ion induced degradation mixture was linear. The significant reduction in T-g was consistent with the significant reduction in the molecular weight; of PDLLA, The linear low molecular fragments (dimers and trimers) in the reaction mixture could act as an internal plasticizers to enhance the T-g reduction by increasing the free volume of chain ends. The relationship of T-g with molecular weight of PDLLA followed the general theory of Fox-Flory. The mechanism of simple hydrolysis of ester by superoxide ion proposed by Forrester et al. was modified to interpret the data obtained from the synthetic biodegradable polymers.

Posterolateral lumbar transverse process fusion using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 carried by sintered bovine bone and Type I collagen complex was compared with fusion achieved using autogenous bone graft or sintered bovine bone alone. Objectives. This study examined the efficacy of sintered bovine bone coated with Type I collagen as a carrier of rhBMP-2 for lumbar intertransverse process arthrodesis. Summary of Background Data. Posterolateral intertransverse process arthrodesis using osteoinductive growth factors is performed experimentally in the lumbar spine. The previous studies revealed the efficacy of osteoinductive factors applied to carriers having no bony structures, such as collagen sheet or polylactic acid polymer, for the spinal fusion. However, in their studies, a large amount of osteoinductive proteins have been applied for the spinal fusion. We used the sintered bovine bone ""True Bone Ceramics"" (TBC; Koken Co., Tokyo, Japan) coated with type I collagen as the carrier. True Bone Ceramics is the only biomaterial possessing a natural trabecular structure and an organized crystal of bone minerals. Methods. Twenty-two adult rabbits underwent bilateral lumbar intertransverse process arthrodesis at L4-L5. The animals were divided into four groups and had materials implanted as follows: autologous bone group, grafted autologous corticocancellous bone harvested from the posterior iliac crest; implanted TBC group; TBC collagen group, implanted TBC coated with Type I collagen infiltrating into the porous space; and BMP group, implanted sintered bovine bone coated with Type I collagen infiltrated with 100 mu g of rhBMP-2. Spinal fusion was evaluated by radiographic analysis, manual palpation, biomechanical testing, and histologic examination 6 weeks after surgery. Results. Two rabbits were killed because of infection and lumbar plexus palsy. Radiographs of the BMP group showed a homogeneous fusion mass at the intertransverse area, and stability was confirmed by dynamic radiographs at 3 and 6 weeks after surgery. In the BMP group, a bony mass in the intertransverse a rea was more prominent than in the other groups. The BMP group had a higher fusion rate based on manual palpation than the-other groups, and BMP fusions showed significantly higher tensile strength and stiffer fusion. The histologic findings in the BMP group demonstrated membranous bone and endochondral bone formations between the transverse process and the fusion mass. In the other groups, continuous trabecular bone formation was observed in the:area surrounding the transverse process, but gaps between grafted fragments and less mature bone formation were present in the intertransverse area. Conclusions. Sintered bovine bone coated with Type-1 collagen and rhBMP-2 resulted in a higher fusion rate than the autograft and can be used as a carrier for rh-BMP-2 in spinal fusion.","Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, Wakayama 6410012, Japan","Minamide, A (reprint author), Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 6410012, Japan.",minamide@wakayama-med.ac.jp,,,,,,46,35,50,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0362-2436,1528-1159,,SPINE,SPINE,SEP 15,1999.0,24,18,,,,,1863,1870,,10.1097/00007632-199909150-00002,,,,8,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,238BV,WOS:000082691800001,10515009.0,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies focused on hexafluoroethane (C2F6, HFE) and tetrafluoroethylene (C2F4, TFE) as the monomer precursor have shown such surfaces to exhibit unique protein binding capabilities. In this study, slow, surface directed deposition of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6, HFP) films is shown to confer surface functional group presentation that promotes high protein retention. The surface chemistry is controllable over a range of values, and C3F6 films prepared by RF-glow discharge are smooth, homogeneous, and defect free. Surface patterns of the fluoropolymer can be created by direct or photolithographic techniques. Scanning probe microscopic analysis indicates a surface modulus in the range of 1.2 < E-HFP < 5.5 GPa. These results are discussed in terms of the applicability of C3F6 films for coating biomaterials. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

To understand the conformation change under different forces, Glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergilius Niger was used as a protein model. Eight glycolipids(1,2-o-dialkyl-3-o-beta-D-glycosylglycerols and alkyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside) were used as the matrixes for this investigation. It was observed that the GOD can penetrate into neutral glycolipid monolayer and change its conformation in favor of the alpha-helix formation. Moreover, GOD strongly adsorbed to the positive charged glycolipid monolayer and change its conformation in favor of the beta-sheet formation. Enzymatic activity measurements showed that the more the alpha-helix conformation content is in the GOD, the higher activity the GOD will be. This fact suggested a new way to mediate the conformation of protein in organized molecular assemblies, and provided a new thinking for the preparation of biomimetic film and biosensor.

At pH values > 8.0, epoxide groups of BDDGE will react with amine groups of collagen. The effects of BDDGE concentration, pH, time, and temperature were studied. Utilization of a 4-wt % BDDGE instead of 1-wt % resulted in a faster reaction. Whereas similar values of shrinkage temperature were obtained, fewer primary amine groups bad reacted at a lower BDDGE concentration, which implies that the crosslinking reaction had a higher efficacy. An:increase in pH from 8.5 to 10.5 resulted in a faster reaction but reduced crosslink efficacy. Furthermore, an increase in reaction temperature accelerated the reaction without changing the crosslink efficacy. Crosslinking under acidic conditions (pH < 6.0) evoked a reaction between epoxide groups and carboxylic acid groups of collagen. Additional studies showed that no oligomeric crosslinks could be formed. However, hydrolysis of the epoxide groups played a role in the crosslink mechanism especially under acidic reaction conditions. The macroscopic properties of these materials were dependent on the crosslinking method. Whereas a flexible and soft tissue was found if crosslinking was performed at pH < 6.0, a stiff sponge was obtained under alkaline conditions. Reaction of DSC with a monofunctional compound (glycidyl isopropyl ether) led to comparable trends in reaction rate and in similar macroscopical differences in materials as observed with BDDGE.

Design: Five-year retrospective review of clinical cases with at least 2-year follow-up. Patients: A cohort of 60 consecutive private patients with complaints of malar hypoplasia or facial asymmetry. Setting: A plastic surgery clinic. Intervention: Silastic midfacial malar implants were fitted in each patient. Most underwent implantation via the canine fossa approach and in conjunction with another facial plastic procedure. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective patient satisfaction, photographic grading using a visual analog scale, and complications. Results: Of the 60 patients, 51 (85.0%) reported an excellent result after at least a 2-year follow-up. Ten patients (16.7%) had some form of undesirable sequelae; however, only 4 (3.4%) of 118 implants had to be revised. Photographically, all 60 patients graded postoperative improvement. Conclusions: Findings support the contention that the Silastic midfacial malar implant is a safe and effective alloplastic alternative to treat malar hypoplasia and facial asymmetry. The complication and revision rates are acceptable. Relative technical ease of insertion makes malar augmentation an excellent adjunct for rhytidectomy and rhinoplasty.","Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Div Facial Plast Surg, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; McCollough Plast Surg Clin PA, Birmingham, AL USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Lexington, KY USA","Metzinger, SE (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, 2020 Gravier St,Suite A, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",,,,,,,15,21,21,0,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0886-4470,,,ARCH OTOLARYNGOL,Arch.

However, in the case of the blended membrane, the density of the adsorbed proteins decreased compared with that of original PSf membrane. That is, the MPC polymer blended in the membrane could function as a protein-adsorption-resistant additive. The number of platelets adhered on the PSf membrane was reduced, and change in the morphology of adherent platelets was also suppressed by the modification with the MPC polymer. Therefore, the PSf/MPC polymer blend membrane had improved blood compatibility compared with the PSf membrane. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The properties of glass polyalkenoate cements based on the generic glass composition (6 + X)SiO2 . (4 - X)Al(2)O(3)1.5P(2)O(5) . 4CaOCaF(2) with varying aluminium to silicon ratio were studied. Setting and working times of the cement pastes, compressive strength, un-notched fracture strength, Young's modulus, fracture toughness and toughness were evaluated for the cements. In contrast to previous studies the aluminium to silicon ratio was not found to influence the cement properties significantly. The high phosphorus content of the glasses studied is thought to reduce the influence of the aluminium to silicon ratio of the glass, as a result of phosphorus locally charge balancing four coordinate aluminium ions in the glass network, as well as providing an additional mechanism of degradation in the form of hydrolysable phosphorus-oxygen bonds.

Bioglass(R) discs were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to preform a calcium phosphate surface layer and subsequently immersed in blank, bovine serum albumin (BSA)- and rM179-containing supersaturated calcification solutions (SCSB, SCSBSA and SCSrM179), respectively. Calcium phosphate layers formed on all the treated samples and were characterized to be apatite by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transmission infrared spectrophotometry. Under scanning electron microscopy, plate-shaped crystals (similar to 50 nm thick and 300-600 nm across) were observed on the samples after PBS incubation. The crystals grown from SCSB were of the typical plate shape except for an increased thickness, while needle-shaped crystals (200-300 nm long and 50-70 nm thick) were precipitated on the SCSBSA-immersed samples. Interestingly, it was found that the crystals deposited on the SCSrM179-immersed samples adopted an elongated, curved shape (similar to 500 nm long and similar to 120 nm thick). Further TEM observations showed that the crystals generated by the SCSrM179 immersion appeared to be composed of bundles of lengthwise crystals (15-20 nm thick) orientated parallel to one another, much alike the long and thin crystals observed in the very early stage of enamel formation. The significant modulation by the rM179 protein of apatite crystal growth is quite different from the overall inhibition observed by BSA and most likely is relevant to the specific function of the amelogenin matrix in controlling enamel crystal growth in vivo.

In particular, an ideal bone-biomaterial would support the activity of osteoblasts in the development of new bone, while simultaneously being resorbed by osteoclasts as part of the lifelong orderly process of bone remodelling. Such resorbable calcium phosphate-based thin films and bulk ceramics have now been created by the high-temperature processing of a fine precipitate, formed from a colloidal sol and stabilized using an additive such as silicon. The materials have two characteristic features: a phase composition which is a mixture of calcium hydroxyapatite and a silicon stabilized tricalcium phosphate, and a microporous morphology based on inter-connected particles (0.2-1 mu m in diameter). X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and light scattering experiments indicate that the characteristic phase composition arises during sintering through substitution reactions where silicon enters the calcium phosphate lattice under conditions of high chemical reactivity. The crystallographic features are linked through the glaserite form of the apatite structure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods: Resins contained one of the epoxies: diglycidyl ether Bisphenol A (GY-6004); 3,4-epoxycyclohexanemethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (UVR-6105); vinyl cyclohexane dioxide (ERL-4206) or the three-epoxy mixture (Epoxy-M). The SOC was t/t-2,3,8,9-di(tetramethylene)-1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane (SOC). The polyols were polytetrahydrofuran (p-THF-250) and polycaprolactone triol (TONE-301). The photoinitiator (4-octylphenyl)phenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate and camphorquinone were used for light curing the resins. Four types of resins (epoxy, SOC/epoxy, polyol/epoxy and SOC/polyol/epoxy) were evaluated for cytotoxicity as solids in the agar diffusion assay and as aqueous extracts in the MTT assay using L929 cells. Results: In agar diffusion analysis, ERL-4206 and UVR-6105 resins were severely cytotoxic (+ + +), but the addition of SOC changed them to non-cytotoxic (-). Addition of 1-3% SOC changed Epoxy-M from mild (+) to non-cytotoxic. Adding SOC changed GY-6004 from moderate (+ +) to mild (-) cytotoxicity. Generally, addition of SOC did not change cytotoxicity when added to polyol/epoxy combinations. Either polyol produced resins with reduced cytotoxicity when added to UVR-6105, but the opposite occurred when added to Epoxy-M resins. In MTT analysis, percent cell survival from 100 mu l resin extracts were statistically compared (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Epoxy-M and GY-6004 resin extracts were significantly less cytotoxic than UVR-6105 and ERL-4206 resin extracts were. Overall, the SOC component reduced the cytotoxicity of all SOC/epoxy combinations, except SOC/ERL-4206, which was significantly more cytotoxic than ERL-4206 resin extract. This may be the result of cell fixative effects observed for SOC/ERL-4206 in agar diffusion analysis. Addition of SOC produced significantly less cytotoxic SOC/polyol/Epoxy-M resins when compared to its non-SOC counterpart. The contrary result was obtained with SOC/polyol/UVR-6105 resin combinations. Consistent with agar diffusion results, adding polyol significantly decreased cytotoxicity of UVR-6105 resins. The cytotoxicity of these resins may be related to the 50% cytotoxicity (TC50) of their components as leachates. The TC50 values of the individual components were compared to BISGMA. Polyols, epoxy monomers, SOC monomer and camphorquinone were significantly(p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than BISGMA. Significance: Addition of SOCs and polyols in the formulation of epoxy-based resins may contribute to development of biocompatible dental composites. (C) 1999 Academy of Dental Materials.

Collagen type I revealed thick fiber bundles, and collagens type Zn and V were distributed as fine fibrils or small bundles throughout the culture system. Frequently, the fibers were oriented parallel to the long axis of the cells, Type VI collagen formed thin fibers and revealed a reticular pattern.

A new method for in vitro calcification is employed, in parallel with an in vivo (subcutaneous animal) model. The nature of crystal phases grown by both methods on porcine bioprosthetic heart valves was investigated. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and stoichiometric chemical analysis were used as tools for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the calcification process. Photomicrographs from leaflets calcified early in vitro (24-48 h) and in vivo (5-10 days) confirmed that calcification initiated in the central region of the tissue, mainly in fibrosa, and extended with time (after 28 and 56 days) in vivo towards the outer surface of the tissue. SEM micrographs from tissue sections of early in vivo and in vitro calcified leaflets showed coexistence of different sizes (1-30 mu m) of crystal phases in contact with tissue fibers. EDS analysis confirmed that the deposits were calcium phosphate salts. Chemical analysis of samples calcified in vivo for longer time periods, showed that the content of the salts was mainly calcium and phosphate with a Ca/P molar ratio 1.78 and 1.94 after 28 and 56 days, respectively. These results suggested that the calcification process is followed by a sequential hydrolytic transformation of CaHPO4. 2H(2)O (DCPD) to Ca4H(PO4)(3). 2.5H(2)O (OCP) and to Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH (HAP). Calcium phosphate crystal phases grown in vitro under controlled conditions and at constant super-saturation provide a successful simulation of the calcification process in the animal model and may be applied in screening new biomaterials with respect to their potential for calcification.

The aim of the study was to investigate the features of titanium oxide and titanium nitride layers produced on titanium alloy by plasma nitriding and oxidizing under glow discharge conditions and their biocompatibility in in vitro tests. The plasma nitriding and oxidizing techniques essentially improved the properties of titanium alloys. Their microstructure and the results of hardness, wear and corrosion resistance tests are presented. In the investigations of the, cellular responses of human fibroblast cells to these layers, three aspects were considered: the number of growing cells, their morphological features and their biological corrosion resistance. Nitriding and oxidizing under glow discharge conditions have provided new possibilities of producing non-toxic, human fibroblast-compatible surface layers on parts made of titanium alloys with sophisticated shapes, Uniform surface layers having a controlled microstructure and phase composition can contribute to the opening of a wider application range of titanium alloys as biomaterials.

Ultraviolet light irradiation under sequential charge of vinyl monomers, such as acrylic acid (AA), n-butyl methacrylate (BMA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] acrylamide (DMAPAAm), or styrene (ST), produced block-grafted surfaces, in which different polymer blocks were sequentially formed on polyST (PST) partially derivatized with N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate groups. Examination of a cross-sectional view under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed a bilayered structure of the PST-b-PDMAAm block-graft copolymer. Three different AB-type block-graft-copolymerized surfaces were prepared for biomedical applications, where block A was the bottom layer and block B the top layer: (1) For heparin immobilization, a polyPDMAPAAm (PDMAPAAm) (A)-polyDMAAm (PDMAAm) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block A layer contained ionically immobilized heparin and the block: B layer functioned as a protective layer to suppress protein adsorption and cell adhesion. (2) For protein immobilization, a PDMAAm (A)-polyAA(PAA) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block B layer covalently fixed the protein and the block A layer functioned as a protective layer to prevent contact of the protein with the substrate. (3) For a drug-releasing surface, a PDMAAm (A)-polyBMA (PBMA) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block A layer contained the drug and the block B layer functioned as a barrier to regulate drug release. These macromolecularly designed surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the immobilization of heparin and protein was visualized by light microscopy, after staining with toluidine blue (for heparin), and fluorescence microscopy (for protein).","Natl Cardiovasc Ctr, Res Inst, Dept Bioengn, Suita, Osaka 5658565, Japan","Matsuda, T (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maedashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.",,,,,,,36,57,59,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,AUG 17,1999.0,15,17,,,,,5560,5566,,10.1021/la981581x,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,228EV,WOS:000082124900022,,,,,2019-02-25

Viability was determined before and after freeze-drying and after heat treatment (100 min at 70 degrees C). Freeze-drying with trehalose, PVP, maltose or 1.8-kDa maltodextrin, and mixtures of maltodextrin/ trehalose increased viability in comparison with controls. The 3.6-kDa maltodextrin was ineffective at protecting the cells during freeze-drying. The glass transition temperature (T-g), which depends on moisture content, was indicated as a possible factor to determine the stability of labile materials. Protective effects of the excipients during thermal treatment were analysed in relation to the physical changes (collapse or structural shrinkage) which were dependent on the T-g of the systems. The presence of a certain amount of amorphous disaccharides during freeze-drying and heating was found to be a critical factor for ensuring cell viability, which was protected even in rubbery (above T-g) matrices.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ind, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Quim, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Buera, MP (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ind, Ciudad Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Buera, Pilar/0000-0001-9290-7299",,,,32,58,63,1,10,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0175-7598,,,APPL MICROBIOL BIOT,Appl.

Granules of natural coral of specific diameter, between 100 and 500 mu m, having high content of calcium (> 98%) and a homogeneous surface adsorb glycosaminoglycans with different capacity. Heparin (maximum adsorption 1.29 +/- 0.10 mg/20 mg of coral, 6.45% w/w) is adsorbed more than highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate species (maximum adsorption of 0.90 +/- 0.06 mg/20 mg of coral, 4.50% w/w), chondroitin sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.72 +/- 0.06 mg/ 20 mg of coral, 3.60% w/w), dermatan sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mg/20 mg of coral, 3.50% w/w) and heparan sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.72 +/- 0.07 mg/20 mg of coral, 3.60% w/w). Hyaluronan is not adsorbed onto granules of coral. The percentage adsorption of polyanions onto coral depends mainly on their charge density, with sulfate groups being more important than carboxyl groups. This study found no evidence that iduronic acid is more important than glucuronic acid and no role of molecular mass on the adsorption of polysaccharides onto coral was found. The adsorption of glycosaminoglycans is driven by electrostatic interactions with calcium sites of coral that are dependent on pH and blocked in the presence of large amounts of salt. Due to these peculiar properties, the combination of granules of natural coral with glycosaminoglycans makes this material potentially useful in osseointegration in bone metabolism or periodontal therapy.

Because polydimethyl siloxane surfaces have good hemo- and bio-compatibility, it is generally believed that surface biocompatibility may be improved by modifying biomaterial surfaces with silicone-like properties. For this, we developed a series of polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone (PDMS-PCL) copolymers. By mixing the substrate material-polyvinyl chloride-with law concentrations (1.2 and 2.4%) of the PDMS-PCL copolymer, we generated materials with silicone-like surface properties as reflected by increased surface silicon content and surface contact angles. We assessed the biocompatibility of these surfaces in vitro and found that the addition of PDMS-PCL significantly reduced the percentages of surface-'denatured' fibrinogen, a critical element of genesis of many adverse responses to implanted biomaterials. Indeed, using an animal implantation model, we find that PDMS-PCL-blended materials triggered significantly weaker inflammatory responses than did polyvinyl chloride, the substrate control. The results from these experiments suggest that the use of PDMS-PCL additives (2.4%) in polymer blends is a useful means of camouflaging the substrate surface properties and improving the biocompatibility of biomaterials.

However, knowledge of the origins and phenotypic characteristics of these progenitors and the controlling factors that govern bone formation and remodeling to give a functional skeleton adequate for physiological needs is limited, Practical methods are currently being investigated to amplify in in vitro culture the appropriate autologous cells to aid skeletal healing and reconstruction. Recent advances in the fields of biomaterials, biomimetics, and tissue engineering have focused attention on the potentials for clinical application, Current cell therapy procedures include the use of tissue-cultured skin cells for treatment of burns and ulcers, and in orthopedics, the use of cultured cartilage cells for articular defects. As mimicry of natural tissues is the goal, a fuller understanding of the development, structures, and functions of normal tissues is necessary. Practically all tissues are capable of being repaired by tissue engineering principles. Basic requirements include a scaffold conducive to cell attachment and maintenance of cell function, together with a rich source of progenitor cells. In the latter respect, bone is a special case and there is a vast potential for regeneration from cells with stem cell characteristics. The development of osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipoblasts, myoblasts, and fibroblasts results from colonies derived from such single cells. They may thus, theoretically, be useful for regeneration of all tissues that this variety of cells comprise: bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendons, and ligaments. Also relevant to tissue reconstruction is the field of genetic engineering, which as a principal step in gene therapy would be the introduction of a functional specific human DNA into cells of a patient with a genetic disease that affects mainly a particular tissue or organ, Such a situation is pertinent to osteogenesis imperfecta, for example, where in more severely affected individuals any improvements in long bone quality would be beneficial to the patient. In conclusion, the potentials for using osteogenic stem cells and biomaterials in orthopedics for skeletal healing is immense, and work in this area is likely to expand significantly in the future, (Bone 25:5S-9S; 1999) (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Three delays (12, 24, and 52 weeks) were used. Before death, a double label of oxytetracycline and alizarine was made intravenously, The distribution of implants was randomized, histomorphometric evaluation was performed and compared with micrographic observation, and optical microscopy of stained sections was performed either under visible, ultraviolet, or polarized light, The results were compared with spontaneous healing of empty defects and with a control group of normal cancellous bone from sheeps of the same age. No significant difference has been observed between premolded and injected implants. In the sheep model, the degradation and new bone formation rates are three times slower, compared with those observed previously in rabbits. New bone formation increased from 5.9% (12 weeks) up to 11.0% (24 weeks) in the empty defect group. In the cement groups, 28.3% new bone was obtained at 12 weeks, which seemed then to level off (27.8% new bone at 24 weeks), Cement residues appear as radio-opaque cylinders on microradiographs, In all cases, a radiolucent layer was observed at the cement/bone interface at 24 weeks, Stained sections showed the formation of a fibroconnective capsule around the residual cement, which presumably slows down new bone formation.

However, apatite-copolylactic solids can he steam sterilized without deterioration. Gelatin has been used as a natural polymer to bind apatite particles.

A large part of the studies has investigated PEG coatings. Nevertheless, there is still controversy about what exactly the properties and modes of action of an 'ideal' PEG coating should be. While some studies have reported no irreversible protein adsorption, other, very similar coatings appear less able to resist bioadhesion. Of great interest are results showing that PEG surfaces with very short chains are capable of rejecting proteins. As it is very difficult to obtain direct information about the microstructure of the coatings, studies typically employ plausible models to interpret observations. New analytical techniques and the direct measurement of interfacial forces between proteins and surfaces open up the possibility of improved, guided design and feedback in the optimization of surfaces intended to resist bioadhesion.

A novel function estimation method was used to extract the material functions from experimental shear data obtained at one strain rate, and the model was used to predict the material response at different strain rates. In general, experiments and predictions were in good agreement, the larger discrepancies being in the prediction of peak stresses and hysteresis in cyclic shear. In shear, Jived tissues are stiffer (mean initial shear modulus, 13 kPa versus 427 Pa), take longer to relax to steady state (mean tau(2) 4,736 s versus 1,764 s) with a slower initial relaxation rate (mean magnitude of (G) over dot(0), 1 s(-1) versus 5 s(-1)) and relax to a lesser extent than fresh tissues (mean percentage stress remaining after relaxation, 60 versus 45 percent). All differences were significant at p = 0.04 or less, except for the initial relaxation slope.

The paraffin processing caused shrinkage and degradation of the polymer, and staining dissolved the remnants. The glycol methacrylate processing minimized damage to the polymer even after staining.

These soluble macromolecular compounds, which are substituted with specific chemical functional groups, are designed to interact with living systems. By analogy with glycosaminoglycan heparin, a natural highly charged anionic polysaccharide that exerts: a variety of biological effects, vpe postulated that CMDBS compounds also possess binding sites capable of specific interactions with biological constituents, depending on the overall composition of the polymer. The synthesis and heparin-like properties of these CMDBS have been extensively investigated. Thus, it appears that dextran derivatives can mimic the action of heparin in regard to its interactions with antithrombin and serine proteases involved in blood coagulation. Other derivatives interact with various components of the immune system or with adhesive proteins such as fibronectin in modulating the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus. Because they are able to stimulate wound healing in various in vivo models, these polysaccharides may also constitute a family of tissue repair agents because of their protecting and potentiating effects with heparin binding growth factors, Moreover, dextran derivatives in contact with cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or tumoral cells can affect both cell proliferation and metabolism. IL appears that these bioactive polymers are also efficient tools to investigate the precise mechanism of action of individual biological activities by contrasting their mode of action to that of heparin, In addition to their numerous biological properties and biospecificity, functionalized dextrans are relatively simple to manufacture and exempt of donor contaminant, which make them attractive in a variety of clinical applications.

We recently demonstrated that the erythroleukemic cell line K562, which normally grows in suspension, can be induced to grow attached to a polylysine-coated solid surface in an anchorage-dependent manner. In this study, the effects of the growth of K562 cells onto polylysine were further investigated utilizing 500 MHz H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The NMR results showed that when K562 cells are grown attached to a positively-charged polylysine surface, there are alterations in lipids and energy metabolism. In particular, there was a 31% increase in phosphatidylcholine and a 15% decrease in each of its two precursors, glycerophosphatidylcholine and choline, as well as a 20% increase in CH2 lipids and a 7% decrease in CH3 lipids in treated cells compared to the controls. These results suggest that adhesive growth can induce strong variations in membrane structure, including the membrane fluidity of K562 cells. In addition, in cells attached to polylysine there was about a 10% decrease in creatine (together with phosphocreatine), a 20% increase in gamma-glutamate, a 15% increase in beta-glutamate, and a 24% decrease in lactate. This second set of results, which is closely related to energy metabolism, indicates that not only does adhesive growth induce changes in K562 cell membrane structure, but also in the utilization of energy in these cells. The data are discussed in view of the possible role played by surface charge in affecting cell structure and function in cells that come into direct contact with charged biopolymers.

A quadratic response-surface model was developed in order to study the effects of treatment time and temperature (in the range of 1000 degrees C to 1250 degrees C) on scale thickness. The obtained model adequately represents the experimental response and shows that the thickness gradients of the layer increase with the temperature for each exposure time and decrease steadily to zero as the treatment time increases. The microstructural characterization reveals that the alumina scale formed at or above 1000 degrees C consists of an alpha-alumina phase. Treatments at temperatures above 1150 degrees C give rise to an alumina scale with some defect probability. An increase in the temperature up to 1200 degrees C gives rise to the appearance of some blistering of the superficial scale. An oxidation treatment of 100 h at 1100 degrees C was found to be the best for guaranteeing the formation of a defect-free, compact, adherent, and continuous oc-alumina scale thick enough to support satisfactory wear and biological conditions.

Both were two-part epoxies cured at room temperature for 24 h, with material 1 (Ampreg 26; SP Systems Limited, Cowes, UK) postcured at 110 degrees C (T-g similar to 80 degrees C) and Material 2 (CG5052; Ciba Geigy Limited, Cambridge, UK) at 125 degrees C (T-g similar to 120 degrees C). Implantation in dead rabbit bone was performed to provide mechanical baseline levels. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and conventionally HA-coated titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) were used as control materials. In the biological study, different fluorescent dyes were used to label newly formed bone. After 6 weeks of implantation, results from mechanical pushout tests showed that the interfacial shear strength (ISS) values were significantly higher than for dead bones with each of the different implants (p < .01-.001). HA-coated material 2 showed a significantly higher ISS value than the uncoated material (p <.05) after 6 weeks' implantation. However, the ISS value for the uncoated material 2 was significantly higher than for PMMA controls (p <.05). No significant differences in the TSS values were shown between HA-coated materials 1 and 2 and Ti-6Al-4V on in vivo implantation for 6 weeks. Failure points of the pushout test from the three HA-coated materials were defined by scanning electron microscopy. Specimens implanted with both HA-coated epoxies were fractured within the HA-coatings or the bone, while with HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V cracked between the coating and metal implant. The percentage of bone in contact with the implant surface was obtained by image analysis which showed that there were no significant differences between different materials after short time implantation (up to 6 week). Longterm implantation of the HA-coated material 2 showed that the percentage of bone contact had increased from 52.8 +/- 1.1% (6 week) to 80.0 +/- 0.3% (3 months) (p <.01) and remained at 81.0 +/- 0.8% (6 months). Measurements of bone mineralization rate (BMR) showed that after 3 weeks of implantation, there were no significant differences between PMMA and uncoated materials 1 and 2. After 6 weeks, the BMRs in animals implanted with either HA-coated material 1 or 2 were significantly higher than with HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V (p <.05-.0001 in both cases), but with HA-coated material 2 was lower than with this material uncoated (p <.05-.001). No significant differences were found between the two HA-coated epoxy materials. In addition, there were always lower BMRs during the third week of implantation than other periods regardless of biomaterial implanted. The study indicated that the adhesively bonded HA-coated novel epoxy materials were superior to conventional plasma-sprayed Ti-6Al-4V implants with respect to both BMR and bone integration with the implant surfaces. Adhesively bonded HA-coated epoxy materials had similar ISS values to HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V, but the former failed within the bone and coating, while the latter showed splitting between coating and metal.

In the present study, are evaluated histologically and mechanically the effect of alumina crystallinity on the osteoconductivity and bone-bonding strength of the composite. AL-P was manufactured by fusing crushed alpha-alumina powder and quenching it. The AL-P was composed mainly of amorphous and delta-crystal phases of alumina. Its average particle size was 3.5 mu m, and it took a spherical form. Another composite (alpha ALC), filled with pure alpha-alumina powder (alpha AL-P), was used as a referential material. The proportion of powder added to each composite was 70% w/w. Mechanical testing of ABC and alpha ALC indicated that they would be strong enough for use under weight-bearing conditions. The affinity indices for ABC, determined using male Wistar rat tibiae, were significantly higher than those for alpha ALC (p < 0.0001) up to 8 weeks. Composite plates (15 x 10 x 2 mm) that had an uncured surface layer on one side were made in situ in a rectangular mold. One of the plates was implanted into the proximal metaphysis of the tibia of a male Japanese white rabbit, and the failure load was measured by a detaching test 10 weeks after implantation. The failure loads for ABC on its uncured surface [1.91 +/- 1.23 kgf (n = 8)] were significantly higher than those for alpha ALC on its uncured surface [0.35 +/- 0.33 kgf (n = 8); (p < 0.0001)], and they also were significantly higher than those for ABC on the other (cured surface) side (p < 0.0001). Histological examinations using rabbit tibiae revealed bone ingrowth into the composite only on the uncured surface of ABC. This study revealed that the amorphous phase of alumina and formation of an uncured surface layer are needed for the osteoconductive and bone-bonding ability of ABC. ABC shows promise as a basis for the development of a highly osteoconductive and mechanically strong biomaterial.

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London, United Kingdom. Methods: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (Alcon Surgical, model MC60BM) and AcrySof (Alcon Surgical, model MA60BM) IOLs were incubated in physiological concentrations of radiolabeled albumin or fibronectin at 37 degrees C for periods between 5 minutes and 1 week. The IOLs were removed and rinsed in buffered saline, and the amount of adsorbed protein was calculated by measuring the radioactivity with scintillation spectrometry. Results: The adsorption of both proteins occurred rapidly over the first 2 hours; the rate of adsorption was concentration dependent. Quantitative differences were found: PMMA lenses bound significantly greater quantities of albumin. initial fibronectin adsorption to both materials was similar, but increased adsorption to AcrySof IOLs was found at days 1 and 7. Conclusions: The differences in protein absorption to PMMA and AcrySof IOLs in vitro may contribute to the differences in the biological response to these IOLs, including the lower rates of posterior capsule opacification associated with acrylic lenses.

At pH 2.0, these biomass types were capable of sequestering up to 8.0 mu mol g(-1), 7.2 mu mol g(-1) and 3.2 mu mol g(-1), respectively. An adverse effect of increasing solution ionic strength (NaNO3) on gold biosorption was observed. Gold-loaded biomass could be eluted with 0.1 mol dm(-3) NaOH with efficiencies higher than 90% at PPI 5.0 at the Solid-to-Liquid ratio, S/L, =4 (gdm(-3)). Cyanide mass balances for the adsorption, desorption as well as for the AVR process indicated the stability of the gold-cyanide which did not dissociate either upon acidification or upon binding by biomass functional groups. Gold biosorption mainly involved anionic AuCN2- species bound by ionizable biomass functional groups carrying a positive charge when protonated. FTIR analyses indicated that the main biomass functional groups involved in gold biosorption are most probably nitrogen-containing weak base groups. The present results confirmed that waste microbial biomaterials have some potential for removing and concentrating gold from solutions where it occurs as a gold-cyanide complex.

Intervention: Groups of simulated periarticular tibia fractures were stabilized with one of six different hybrid external fixator designs. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness of each specimen was measured in compression, torsion, flexion bending, extension bending, and varus/valgus bending. Results: Fixators with multiple levels of fixation in the peri articular fragment, regardless of design, were stiffer than those with one level. Specifically, the EBI Ring Connector fixator was stiffer than all others in all modes of testing. The Ace, Synthes, Smith & Nephew Richards, and Howmedica fixators were mechanically similar. The Zimmer Torus fixator was the least stiff fixator tested. Conclusions: Fixators with multiple levels of fixation in the periarticular fragment, regardless of design, were stiffer than those with one level. The: choice of which hybrid external fixator to use should be made based not only on stiffness but also on ease of clinical application, patient comfort, customer support from the manufacturer, and cost.

While this is a simple matter when working with free weights and machines, it becomes more difficult with plyometric training, especially in the case of the upper body. Weight training is often performed at intensities approaching 100%. Plyometric training must be performed at an intensity high enough to cause adaptation in the relevant biomaterials but not at intensities so great as to prolong amortization and to compromise the use of the serial elastic component and stretch reflex. Research recommendations exist for lower-body plyometrics, such as the depth jump, that suggest an optimal range of jump heights. Nonetheless, recommendations often do not consider the subject's body mass and impact force. Training loads for upper-body plyometrics performed with medicine balls have not been quantified. This study determines the vertical impact forces of the medicine ball (MB) for the purpose of quantifying training loads of MB drills with a vertical component. Based on results of the regression analysis, the following model was developed: vertical impact force [(height{cm} x 5.58) + (mass {kg} x 59.65)] - 468.30. The regression equation, expressed in pounds, is as follows: vertical impact force = [(height {in.} x 3.19) + (mass {lb.} x 6.09)] - 105.37. The model is highly accurate, as evidenced by the high multiple R (R = 0.98) and low standard error of estimate (SEE) (37.4 N; 8.409 Ib.). Recommendations are made to employ MB training loads of approximately 30% of 1 repetition maximum of biomechanically comparable weight-training exercise.","Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; No Michigan Univ, US Olymp Educ Ctr, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; No Michigan Univ, Dept Hlth Phys Educ & Recreat, Marquette, MI 49855 USA","Ebben, WP (reprint author), Marquette Univ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",,,,,,,13,10,10,0,3,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1064-8011,,,J STRENGTH COND RES,J.

Methods: A prerequisite for guided tissue regeneration is the availability of materials with suitable physicochemical and bio-compatibility properties for the preparation of the devices. We investigated bone and peripheral nerve guided tissue regeneration, making two conduits from poly[L-lactide-co-6-caprolactone] (PLLC - peripheral nerve) and with poly [DL-lactide] (PDLLA - bone) with different features. After the polymer synthesis and chemical characterization, the conduits were evaluated in vivo in rat sciatic nerve gaps and in rabbit radius defects, Results: The results demonstrated good biocompatibility of both polymeric conduits, A good axonal regeneration and the restoration of the nerve trunk continuity, similar to that observed with autologous grafts has been obtained with PLLC conduits, that slowly degrade in about 6 months, PDLLA conduits protected the bone defect against the invasion of surrounding soft tissues; an effective bone growth bridging the defect was observed in their lumen. Conclusion: These results confirm the versatility of polylactides as biomaterials and will encourage further investigations on hard and soft tissues.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Giardino, R (reprint author), Codivilla Putti IOR Res Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,30,23,26,0,7,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1079-6061,,,J TRAUMA,J.

Bone is thereby formed without exogenous bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), well-characterized inducers of bone formation. Monolithic discs of sintered hydroxyapatite, fabricated with concavities of 800 and 1600 mu m diameter on both planar surfaces, were implanted in the rectus abdominis of the baboon (Papio ursinus). Histology on days 30 and 90 revealed de novo generation of bone exclusively within the concavities of the substratum. Porous hydroxyapatites were subsequently fabricated by impregnating polyurethane foams with slurry preparations of powdered hydroxyapatite, so that porous spaces formed by the coalescence of repetitive sequences of concavities. Artefacts were sintered in rod and disc configurations for implantation in heterotopic intramuscular sites and orthotopic calvarial sites, respectively. In four specimens, bone had formed in concavities of the substratum 30 days after implantation in the rectus abdominis. On day 90, bone morphogenesis with associated marrow had occurred in 33 specimens (41 %). Calvarial specimens showed substantial bone formation, culminating in complete penetration of bone within the porous spaces. On day 30, the immunolocalization of BMP family members (BMP-3 and OP-1/BMP-7) in cellular material at the hydroxyapatite interface suggests that the sintered ceramic may act as a solid-state matrix for adsorption of endogenously produced BMPs. These experiments demonstrate intrinsic osteoinductivity by monolythic and porous sintered hydroxyapatites implanted in heterotopic sites of adult primates, and that the geometry of the substratum profoundly regulates the expression of the osteogenic phenotype. The incorporation of specific biological activities into biomaterials achieved by manipulating the geometry of the substratum, defined as geometric induction of bone formation, will help engineer morphometric responses for therapeutic osteogenesis in clinical contexts.","Univ Witwatersrand, Bone Res Unit, MRC, Sch Med, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa; CSIR, Div Mat Sci & Technol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Bone Res Unit, MRC, Sch Med, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",177ripa@chiron.wits.ac.za,"Rohlf, F/A-8710-2008",,,,,56,114,128,0,11,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Using cell cultures the changes of cell functions induced by artificial materials may be evaluated. In screening rests the effect of biomaterials on functions common to all cell types is investigated through both continuous lines and primary cultures. In supplementary tests the effect of biomaterials on specific functions is studied, employing cells of the same type of those which will be in contact with the device in vivo. Osteoblasts, either From primary culture or an established line, are used to study the interaction with materials for bone implants. We evaluated whether dental cements affect the replication cycle of osteoblast-like cells MG63. The S phase was inhibited by the cements with a phenolic group, even though to a different extent. Mononuclear cell cultures are used to investigate the immune response, which is important in the host reaction to implant. We investigated whether the chromium ions released in a biological fluid may induce PBMC to produce cytokines involved in bone resorption. Chromium extract did not impair TNF alpha release significantly, but inhibited IL-6 release significantly in stimulated PBMC. Endothelial cell cultures are useful to the evaluation of materials for vascular grafts. We studied the influence of some types of Dacron on endothelial functions. Collagen-coated Dacron decreased significantly the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F-1 alpha.

Afterwards, the shape memory of the composite material was tested by performing a set of simple experiments based on deformation and heating of test pieces, their subsequent cooling and deformation force removing, and their repeated heating or water swelling, during which the residual elongation was measured and calculated. The composite material shaped in this way resumes its original shape if it is again heated above T-g of the crosslinked polyacrylamide or allowed to swell in distilled water. There exists a limiting concentration of hydrogel phase (approx. 30 phr), which is limited by good dispersion and good contact of hydrogel particles within the silicone matrix, under which the shape memory does not occur, and above which it exists.","Inst Chem Technol, Dept Polymers, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic","Hron, P (reprint author), Inst Chem Technol, Dept Polymers, Technicka 5, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,10,9,9,0,5,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0003-3146,,,ANGEW MAKROMOL CHEM,Angew.

These parameters are estimated for platelet deposition onto a collagen substrate for simple parallel-plate how of whole blood in both the presence and absence of thrombin. One set of experimental results is used as a benchmark for model-fitting purposes. The ""trained"" model is then validated by applying it to additional test cases from the literature for parallel-plate Poiseuille flow over collagen at both higher and lower wall shear rates, and in the presence of various anticoagulants. The predicted values agree very well with the experimental results for the training cases, and good reproduction of deposition trends and magnitudes is obtained for the heparin, but not the citrate, validation cases.

Morphologic changes of cells that were contacted biomaterials or biomaterial extracts indicate their toxicity. However, information on cytotoxic effects is still obtained by subjective visual inspection of microscopic samples. In this article, a novel computer assisted method is introduced. The automatic analysis of digitized micrographs is achieved in several stages: segmentation, separation, classification, and measurement The segmentation of the image is provided by a new local adaptive thresholding technique, which adapts the threshold window sizes onto local gray level distribution and yields optimal window sizes. The actual threshold is obtained by maximizing interclass variances and minimizing intraclass variance. For the separation of connected cells, the binarized samples are cleaned from ""false"" markers by morphologic filtering. The subsequent separation is a two phase approach. Information levels are generated top-down by successively applying an enhanced erosion operator, which yields markers and filters noise usually evolving from multiple erosions. The converse bottom-up integration of the eroded markers is performed by successively applying an enhanced dilation operator, which reconstructs the cells and prevents merging of already separated objects. The subsequent measuring provides quantitative parameters of the distribution of size and compactness of the cells contained within the sample. The method was evaluated by L-929 fibroblasts that were in contact with 0%, 5%, and 10% concentrations of ethanol. For each concentration, 268 images of the cell populations were captured. The obtained quantitative parameters are highly correlated to the common verbal description of morphologic changes. Therefore, the proposed automatic method has several advantages compared with subjective examinations. The re suits allow an objective comparison of the quantification of phenomena; the subjective influence of the observer is eliminated; and the laboratory staff is relieved of time consuming routine work.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Med Informat, D-5100 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Physiol, D-5100 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res Biomat, D-5100 Aachen, Germany","Metzler, V (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, TZL, Inst Signalverarbeitung & Proze, Seelandstr 1A, D-23569 Lubeck, Germany.",,,,,,,27,17,28,0,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-AUG,1999.0,45,4,,,,,264,271,,10.1097/00002480-199907000-00004,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,220RQ,WOS:000081681600004,10445730.0,,,,2019-02-25

The system possesses a computerized user interface for controlling a linear displacement pulsatile pump in a controlled flow loop format to emulate in vivo cardiovascular characteristics. Evaluation of the pump system consisted of comparing its aortic pressure and flow profiles with in vivo rhesus hemodynamic waveforms in the time and frequency domains. Comparison of aortic pressure and flow data between the pump system and in vivo data showed good agreement in the time and frequency domains, however, the pump system produced a larger pulse pressure. The pump system can be used for comparing cardiovascular parameters with predicted cardiovascular model values and for evaluating such items as vascular grafts, heart valves, biomaterials, and sensors.

The new lipids were shown to be at least equivalent to MePEGA-2000-DSPE in assays designed to evaluate the effectiveness of polymers as steric barrier molecules in liposomes. Liposomes containing 1-5% of ATTA8-DSPE (octamer) showed comparable long circulation behavior relative to PEG-2000-DSPE analogues. Surprisingly, the shorter ATTA4-DSPE (tetramer) appeared to be quite effective in reducing clearance. Liver enzyme levels and systemic single dose tolerability of ATTA8-DSPE liposomes were comparable to controls, suggesting that the new materials are nontoxic. Prolonged exposure of ATTA8-DSPE liposomes to splenocytes in vitro showed no evidence of mitogenicity relative to controls or MePEGA-2000-DSPE liposomes. ATTA8-DSPE was as effective as MePEGC-2000-DSPE in preventing complement activation by cationic liposome systems. Repeat dosage in vivo regimes in ICR mice using DSPC/cholesterol liposomes, with and without 5% ATTA8-DSPE and MePEGC-2000-DSPE, showed no evidence of enhanced clearance on successive doses. Splenocytes recovered after repeat doses showed no significant evidence of mitogenicity on restimulation with liposomes. Cellular differentiation and activation marker levels in splenocytes recovered after the fourth in vivo administration were at normal levels. These results suggest that ATTAn oligomers do not induce an immune response in isolation. It was demonstrated that ATTA8-DSPE could be used to replace PEG-lipids in the formulation of doxorubicin, plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides using a variety of formulation techniques. The study demonstrates that ATTAn oligomers can be safely and effectively used in place of poly(ethylene glycol) as well-defined biomaterials in liposomal applications where reproducible behavior is critical.","Inex Pharmaceut Corp, Burnaby, BC V5J 5J8, Canada","Ansell, SM (reprint author), Inex Pharmaceut Corp, 100-8900 Glenlyon Pkwy, Burnaby, BC V5J 5J8, Canada.",,"Hankins, Jane/N-3362-2018",,,,,37,8,9,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1043-1802,,,BIOCONJUGATE CHEM,Bioconjugate Chem.,JUL-AUG,1999.0,10,4,,,,,653,666,,10.1021/bc990005p,,,,14,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Organic",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,219QC,WOS:000081617100015,10411464.0,,,,2019-02-25

Cells were cultured in the presence of Laddec(R) (a highly purified bovine xenograft) and Bio-Oss(R) (natural bone mineral). Optical microscopic observations showed that osteoblasts attached on the plastic culture dishes and formed close contact with biomaterial particles. By day 5, the osteoblasts formed a confluent monolayer. A cytozymatic method showed intense alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining around and between the substrate granules of the two materials. By day 14, inverted phase microscopic observations showed that osteoblasts formed bone nodules around and between substrate particles, In addition, at this time, the Von Kossa staining was positive. Using a conventional assay, ALP specific activity was higher in the presence of Laddec(R) than in the presence of Bio-Oss(R). A quantitative morphological method using image analysis showed that the proportion of mineralized bone formed around biomaterial particles in relation to total bone was increased with Laddec(R) (15% more than with Bio-Oss(R)). Ultrastructural observations by TEM showed the presence of an electron dense collagen-free layer at the biomaterial/bone interface and a collagenous matrix deposited at the periphery, indicating the bioactivity of the biomaterials. These results indicated that Laddec(R) increased the expression of ALP in osteoblast cultures and facilitated the formation of multiple cell layers, providing a culture environment suitable for mineralization.

The results obtained highlighted different electrophoresis profiles between nonencrusted and encrusted stents. Western blot showed the ubiquitous presence of albumin, while Tamm-Horsfall Protein and al-microglobulin adsorption was limited to nonencrusted devices. By an in vitro dynamic model in which, artificial urine was flowed through the lumen of control and retrieved nonencrusted stents, we demonstrated that the organic layer remarkably enhanced crystal precipitation and aggregation events on the surface.

Infections constitute one serious complication which may lead to the removal of the implant. In contrast to infections around polymer implants, infections around skin-penetrating titanium implants anchored in the temporal bone are often cured by local treatment. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common etiological agents in infections related to polymers whereas Staphylococcus aureus is considered as the main pathogen in infections around metallic implants, Microbial adhesion is a prerequisite for an infection. In the present study, the cell surface of microbes isolated from the skin around skin-penetrating titanium implants, with and without signs of infection, was characterized with respect to expression of cell surface hydrophobicity and to binding of immobilized fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen type 1 which could mediate adhesion. Expression of protein binding was similar in strains isolated from the two groups. No strain expressed a hydrophobic cell surface as determined by two-phase separation, and we conclude that the microenvironment around a titanium implant promotes expression of a hydrophilic rather than a hydrophobic cell surface which in turn makes many infections around a titanium implant curable by local treatment.

Each type of microcapsules has a membrane of different composition. Using three kinds of monomers, N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), 4-(aminomethyl)styrene (AmSt), and N,N-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide (DMAPAA), one type of aqueous copolymer having primary and tertiary amino groups was obtained. By the polymerization of three kinds of monomers, DMAAm, AmSt, and 2-[(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium-chloride (METAC), another type of aqueous copolymer having primary and quaternary ammonium groups was also obtained. Two more types of copolymers were synthesized by copolymerization of alpha-acryloxy-omega-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (a-PEG) with the above two kinds of monomer mixture. These copolymers were polymerized with terephthaloyldichloride at the water/oil interface to prepare Pour types of microcapsules containing water, i.e., poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAA-co-AmSt-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAA-co-AmSt-co -PEG-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, poly (DMAAm-co-METAC-co-AmSt-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, and poly (DMAAm-co-METAC-co-AmSt-co-PEC-alt-tefephthalic acid) microcapsules, which will be abbreviated to MC 1, MC 2, MC 3, and MC 4, respectively. It has been predicted that the microcapsule membranes are hydrophilic and soft and have two-sublayer structures from electrophoretic mobility measurements and from the analysis of the data with Ohshima's electrokinetic theory for soft particles. The outer sublayers of MC 1 and MC 2 are negatively charged and those of MC 3 and 4 are slightly positively charged. Also, the surfaces of MC 1 and MC 2 are harder than those of MC 3 and 4. By PEGylation, the surface charge density in the membranes decreases and the surface becomes softer. It has been found that the membrane of red blood cells (RBC) is also soft and is composed of two-sublayers, the outer sublayer of which is negatively charged and the inner one is positively charged. The interaction of four types of microcapsules with RBC has been studied. It was found that microcapsules with soft surfaces (MC 3 and MC 4) do not interact with RBC, even though the microcapsule surfaces are positively charged and the surface of RBC is negatively charged. On the other hand, microcapsules with negatively charged but harder surfaces (MC 1) interact with RBC to introduce hemolysis. The membrane surface of MC 2, which is obtained by PEGylation of MC 1, becomes softer than that of MC 1 so that the interaction with RBC was weakly suppressed. From these, it was concluded that the dominant factor to control the interaction between synthetic polymer surfaces and biological cell surfaces is not the surface charges carried by the polymer surfaces but the softness of the polymer surfaces.

In this study, we present a detailed morphological and functional characterization of covalently side-bound dextran layers by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS). The surface chemistry was monitored step-by-step by ellipsometric characterization of the surface loading. Dextrans of various molecular masses (10-2000 kD) were immobilized leading to surface loadings between 3 and mm(-2). The refractive indices of the covalently attached dextran layers under atmospheric conditions (n(D) = 1.51) ng mm were very close to the refractive index of a spin-coated dextran layer (n(D) = 1.52) indicating dense and homogeneous coverage achieved by the coupling chemistry. Under buffer solution, refractive indices between 1.34 and 1.365 and thicknesses between 20 and 40 nm of these dextran layers were determined. A dextran concentration in the hydrated layers of 0.05-0.21 g cm(-3) was estimated from the refractive index. The density and the thickness of the hydrated layers increased with molecular mass of the dextran. Non-specific binding was strongly reduced by the dextran layers and decreased with increasing thickness and density of the layer. Specific antibody binding to haptens immobilized in the dextran layer lead to an increase of both the density and the thickness of the layers. Time resolved detection by RIfS indicated significant decrease of protein mobility in the dextran layer. From these results we conclude that the functional properties of dextran layers with respect to protein interactions are determined by their effective pore-size, which is controlled by the number of bonds, the surface loading and the concentration of charged groups in the polymer.

This technique was compared to three traditional methods: mineralisation with acid digestion (method A) also known as ""wet method"", dry ashing (with or without oxygen) (method B); classic Kjeldaal (method C). The new approach (method D) modifies the mineralisation phase and the instrument operating instructions. Al, Na, Cr, K, Ni, Co, Ti, Fe, Hg, Pb, V, Sb and Cu levels were tested with the four methods on bane, muscle, cartilage, skin, brain, lymph nodes, blood, urine, and hair. Test results were checked by the addition method Results demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of Al, Cr, Ni, Ti and Hg recovery with the new approach. The advantages of method D are no residue, no redox reaction, insignificant loss of analytes and enhanced sensitivity (at ppb level vs ppm of the other methods). This approach should be considered especially when testing heavy metals and complex matrices. Its disadvantages are that it is more time consuming and requires the presence of an operator.","Inst Ortoped Rizzoli, Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, Serv Chirurg Sperimentale, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Dept Forens Med, Bologna, Italy; Maris Adelaide Inst, Turin, Italy; Univ Bologna, Sch Med, Bologna, Italy","Fini, M (reprint author), Inst Ortoped Rizzoli, Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, Serv Chirurg Sperimentale, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969; Brayda-Bruno, Marco/0000-0002-8608-0114",,,,49,2,2,0,6,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Despite the large number of experimental studies, there is a lack of fundamental information on SIS anisotropic mechanical behavior and how this behavior changes postimplantation. As a first step in our study of remodeling biomaterials, we performed biaxial mechanical testing to quantify the anisotropic mechanical behavior and used small-angle Light scattering (SALS) to quantify the gross fiber structure of fresh, unimplanted SIS. Structural results indicate that SIS displays primarily a single, continuous preferred fiber direction oriented parallel to the long axis of the intestine. Occasionally, two distinct fiber populations oriented at similar to+/-280 with respect to the longitudinal axis could be distinguished. Consistent with this structure, SIS exhibited a nonlinear, anisotropic mechanical response with higher stresses along the longitudinal axis. Further, the circumferential stress-strain response was strongly affected by the maximum longitudinal strain level, but the maximum circumferential strain level only weakly affected the longitudinal stress-strain response. This asymmetric mechanical coupling suggests strong mechanical interactions on a fiber level. SIS stress-strain response also was similar to glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium, attesting to the substantial strength of SIS in the fresh, untreated state. The results of this study will provide a basis for a future analysis of the structural and mechanical changes during the remodeling process.

These materials have application as injectable cardiovascular implants;cytotoxicity due to leachable products, as well as inflammation caused by the biomaterial itself, may ultimately affect the biocompatibility of the implant. We utilized a 7-day in vitro cytotoxicity assay to quantify cell density and cellular proliferation in the presence of copolymer films. The copolymer films exhibited slight to moderate cytotoxicity toward cultured endothelial cells, showing 20-86% viability relative to controls. Cell viability increased with an increasing weight percent of PEG or, to a lesser extent, the molecular weight of PEG. In vivo biocompatibility was assessed using a cage implantation model over a 21-day time period. This system was used to characterize the local cellular and humoral inflammatory response in the surrounding exudate, as well as the size and density of macrophages adherent to the material itself. All copolymer formulations exhibited excellent biocompatibility relative to controls with no significant differences in total leukocyte count among the different formulations. The in vivo inflammatory reaction displayed normal wound healing over 21 days as shown by a progressive decrease in both leukocyte concentration and enzymatic activity. The surface coverage of the copolymer films remained relatively constant from 7 to 21 days; There were no cells larger than 0.003 mm(2),which was previously shown to be the threshold value for foreign-body giant cells.,These data suggest that P(PF-co-EG) hydrogels have potential for use as injectable biomaterials.

They are now accepted as a prime component of signal transduction. Because focal adhesions also play an important role in cell morphology and migration, it can be argued that their presence is indicative of healthy cells. This has been the reason for several research groups to conclude that biomaterials sustaining focal adhesion assembly are biocompatible. In this study we demonstrate that cells under cytotoxic stress may still be able to retain their focal adhesions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells at passage 2 were exposed to nickel and zinc ion solutions ranging from 1 to 0.01 mM for 4 and 24 h. Cells were seeded on fibronectin precoated glass slides or in tissue culture quality 96-well plates. MTT conversion with 1 and 0.5 mM nickel and zinc was strongly depressed, indicating that these concentrations are cytotoxic. Proliferative activity was also affected by these concentrations. Cells exposed to zinc typically retracted and detached from the surface, whereas cells exposed to nickel remained on the surface without signs of retraction. Nevertheless, cells exposed to nickel were impaired to reach con fluency, which was determined by cadherin-5 expression. All these data indicate that nickel ions at a sufficient concentration influence cells in a cytotoxic way. Despite this apparent cytotoxicity, focal adhesion distribution as visualized by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin was not affected. With zinc the morphological changes were accompanied by apparent fusion of focal adhesions during retraction and finally dissolution. These data indicate that the mere presence of focal adhesions does not allow a reliable statement about the functional status of a fell. On the other hand, when focal adhesions are affected it is an excellent monitor of disturbed cell function.

This is the first report on the observation of platelets adhered to opaque biomaterials in real time under shear flow conditions. The direct observation of platelet adhesion to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) as an opaque biomaterial revealed that the kinetics of platelet adhesion to ePTFE depended greatly on shear stresses, showing that the shear stress of 5.0 dyne/cm(2) induced higher adhesiveness of platelets to ePTFE than that of either 0.1 or 15 dyne/cm(2). The observation also showed a difference in platelet adhesiveness among ePTFEs with different fibril lengths-0, 3.2, 18, and 35 mu m-indicating that ePTFEs with shorter fibril length had lower adhesiveness of platelets under a shear stress of 5.0 dyne/cm(2). It is indispensable for analyzing the phenomena of platelet adhesion to opaque biomaterials to observe in real-time rolling, adhesion, and detachment of platelets under shear stresses without disturbing shear flow conditions. The results showed that the mechanical and optical design of the system could serve this purpose.

These substitutes lack the osteogenic and osteoinductive properties of bone autograft, A direct approach would be to stimulate osteogenesis in these biomaterials by the addition of fresh bone-marrow cells (BMC). We therefore created osteoperiosteal gaps 2 cm wide in the ulna of adult rabbits and either bridged them with coral alone (CC), coral supplemented with BMC, or left them empty, Coral was chosen as a scaffold because of its good biocompatibility and resorbability, In osteoperiosteal gaps bridged with coral only, the coral was invaded chiefly by fibrous tissue. It was insufficient to produce union after two months. In defects filled with coral and BMC an increase in osteogenesis was observed and the bone surface area was significantly higher compared with defects filled with coral alone. Bony union occurred in six out of six defects filled with coral and BMC after two months. An increase in the resorption of coral was also observed, suggesting that resorbing cells or their progenitors were present in bone marrow and survived the grafting procedure. Our findings have shown that supplementation of coral with BMC increased both the resorption of material and osteogenesis in defects of a clinical significance.","Univ D Diderot, Lab Rech Orthoped, UPRES A 7052, CNRS, F-75010 Paris, France","Petite, H (reprint author), Univ D Diderot, Lab Rech Orthoped, UPRES A 7052, CNRS, 10 Ave Verdun, F-75010 Paris, France.",,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060",,,,29,39,43,2,3,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND WC2N 6ET",0301-620X,,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

We constructed a closed loop in vitro heparinized whole human blood circulation model for testing hemocompatibility of coronary stents, This model allows evaluation of human blood activation by blood-stent interaction in a well-controlled setting, Until now these interactions were studied in the highly coagulable pig coronary artery model. Methods: We evaluated activation of the coagulation system and blood components by uncoated, heparin-coated, and silicon-carbide coated tantalum stents, The effects, measured by biochemical assays, were compared with stainless-steel stents, Also the inhibitory effect on platelet activation by indomethacin equal to the oral effect of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily, was measured and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Both activation of the coagulation system and platelets were counteracted by indomethacin, suggesting an important role for platelets in activation of the coagulation system in this model. Despite platelet activation by all stents, the SiC-coated tantalum stent demonstrates a significantly lower GpIIIa receptor-mediated platelet adhesion at the stent surface (21.7 X 10(3) counts per second/mg stent weight) compared to all other stents (stainless-steel 54.0, heparin-coated 95.7 and uncoated 76.2 X 10(3) cps/mg). Also activated leukocytes demonstrated a significantly loner CD11b receptor-mediated adhesion at the SiC-coated stent (37.0 X 10(3) cps/mg) than at the stainless-steel stent (114.5 X 10(3) cps/mg).

Single EPD coatings cracked during sintering owing to the 15-18% sintering shrinkage, but the HAp did not decompose. The use of dual coatings (coat, sinter, coat, sinter) resolved the cracking problem. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) inspection revealed that the second coating filled in the ""valleys"" in the cracks of the first coating. The interfacial shear strength of the dual coatings was found, by ASTM F1044-87, to be similar to 12 MPa on a titanium substrate and similar to 22 MPa on 316L stainless steel, comparing quite favorably with the 34 MPa benchmark (the shear strength of bovine cortical bone was found to be 34 MPa). Stainless steel gave the better result since alpha-316L (20.5 mu m mK(-1)) > alpha-HAp (similar to 14 mu m mK(-1)), resulting in residual compressive stresses in the coating, whereas alpha-titanium (similar to 10.3 mu m mK(-1)) < alpha-HAp, resulting in residual tensile stresses in the coating.

We investigated the possibility of using a modified cellulosic membrane for continuous therapies, assessing the hydraulic characteristics and clearance performances of high-flux cellulose triacetate hemodiafilter (0.7 m(2)) in vitro and in vivo. The flowdynamic characteristics of the filter suggest its optimal use in veno-venous pump-drive techniques. Efficiency was excellent, with urea daily clearances as high as 50 liters or more. The high permeability and porosity of the membrane also increased the clearances of larger solutes such as creatinine and inulin.

Osteoblasts cultured with true bone ceramic exhibited greater increases in DNA and collagenous protein synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity than those cultured with hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, expression of mRNA for type-I collagen and osteocalcin, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was higher in cultures grown on true bone ceramic or hydroxyapatite than in those grown with glass fragments, and levels of gene expression in true bone ceramic and hydroxyapatite cultures were at almost the same level. These findings indicate that osteoblasts cultured with true bone ceramic increase their activity, suggesting that true bone ceramic may be a more favorable substrate than hydroxyapatite for growth and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells.","Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, Wakayama 640, Japan; Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Lab Med, Wakayama 640, Japan","Matsumoto, T (reprint author), 27,7 Bancho, Wakayama 6408156, Japan.",tac@wakayama-med.ac.jp,,,,,,25,17,25,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0736-0266,1554-527X,,J ORTHOP RES,J.

Many studies have show that various growth factors enhance wound healing in animal models. However, growth factors are expensive and complex and their wound pharmacokinetics are unknown. The cinical trials with growth factors in the treatment of chronic wounds have produced unsuccessful results. A viable alternative to growth factors may be certain biomaterials such as hydrophilic, carbohydrate beads. Materials and Methods. Positively charged, negatively charged, or uncharged beads were applied to paired 6-cm rat incisions. The following key aspects of the wound healing process were examined: wound breaking strength and histological analysis. Results. Our data show that wounds treated with positively charged, DEAE Sephadez beads had a 46-50% (P < 0.001) increase in breaking strength over untreated control wounds. A variety of other positively charged, anion exchange materials also elicited a wound healing response, despite the fact that the positively charged chemical moieties as well as the bead matrix were different, hi conjunction with the increase in wound breaking strength, an increase in wound macrophage was observed in wounds treated with anion exchangers (P < 0.01). Negatively charged or uncharged beads showed no significant difference from the untreated controls. Conclusion. We conclude from this study that the enhancement of wound healing seen with positively charged beads is due principally to the positive charge on the beads; we postulate that the anion exchange between the positively charged beads and tissue is responsible for this enhancement.

Looking at the bio-joint mechanism, the solid-fluid composite structure of the cancellous bone is likely to play a great important role in the load transmission. So, the solid-fluid composite model equal to the cancellous bone was made by using honeycomb structure. Static indentation testing was carried out, and in-plane deformation conditions of the solid-fluid composite specimens were measured quantitatively. Experimental results illustrated that the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid phase greatly influenced on the in-plane deformation condition of the solid phase. Consequently, as for the solid-fluid composite models, the compressive load dispersion by the solid-fluid phase interaction was expected.","Doshisha Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 6100321, Japan; Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd, Hydraul Excavator Dev Ctr, Akashi, Hyogo 6748686, Japan","Katayama, T (reprint author), Doshisha Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 6100321, Japan.",,,,,,,15,3,3,0,1,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"SHINANOMACHI-RENGAKAN BLDG, SHINANOMACHI 35, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 160, JAPAN",1340-8046,,,JSME INT J A-SOLID M,JSME Int.

Methods: Viscoelastic shear properties of various implantable biomaterials (Teflon, gelatin, collagen, fat, hyaluronic acid, and hyaluronic acid with fibronectin) were measured with a parallel-plate rotational rheometer, Elastic and viscous shear properties were quantified as a function of oscillation frequency (0.01-15 Hz) at 37 degrees C. Results: The shear properties of hyaluronic acid were relatively close to those of human vocal fold mucosal tissues reported previously. Hyaluronic acid at specific concentrations (0.5%-1%), with or without fibronectin, was found to exhibit viscous shear properties (viscous shear modulus and dynamic viscosity) similar to those of the average male and female vocal fold mucosa. Conclusions: According to a theory that establishes the effects of tissue shear properties on, vocal fold oscillation, phonation threshold pressure (a measure of the ease of phonation) is directly related to the viscous shear modulus of the vibrating vocal fold mucosa. Therefore, our findings suggest that hyaluronic acid, either by itself or mixed with fibronectin, may be a potentially optimal bioimplant for the surgical management of vocal fold mucosal defects and lamina propria deficiencies (e.g., scarring) from a biomechanical standpoint.","Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Denver Ctr Performing Arts, Wilbur James Gould Voice Res Ctr, Denver, CO USA","Chan, RW (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, 330 WJSHC, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",roger-chan@uiowa.edu,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [P60 DC00976],,,39,82,85,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-852X,1531-4995,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,JUL,1999.0,109,7,1,,,,1142,1149,,10.1097/00005537-199907000-00026,,,,8,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,212YC,WOS:000081244400026,10401858.0,,,,2019-02-25

Various biomaterials are used for reconstruction of the anophthalmic orbit, often with unsatisfactory long-term results. Implants have been placed between the periorbital and the orbital floor. The authors describe a new material composed of hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP) in the form of ceramic blocks, to be placed into the orbital fat as a new surgical site. Methods: Ten patients with PESS underwent surgery to compensate the volume deficit of the anophthalmic orbit. Blocks of HA-TCP were created by fragmentation of a larger piece, tailored as needed, and implanted in the orbital fat. The patients were monitored regularly with clinical and radiologic examinations to evaluate the behavior of the implants. Results: The volume of the HA-TCP was measured in 5 cases (mean, 2.95 +/- 1.08 ml). A significant reduction of enophthalmos was obtained: mean Hertel exophthalmometry measured 12.7 +/- 2.5 mm preoperatively and 14 +/- 2.4 mm postoperatively (P < 0.05). The average prosthesis volume was significantly reduced in the cases measured: 2.7 ml +/- 0.94 ml preoperatively and 1.8 +/- 0.7 ml postoperatively (p < 0.02). There was a negative correlation between the HA-TCP implant volume and postoperative prosthesis volume (correlation coefficient = -0.925; p < 0.05). According to photographic evaluation, correction of the enophthalmos and of the superior sulcus depression were obtained in 70% and 90% of cases, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging seems to demonstrate that the blocks become well integrated into the surrounding orbital tissue. Conclusion: The HA-TCP blocks correct some anomalies of PESS. Placement of the blocks directly into the orbital fat is a promising alternative to the traditional subperiosteal location.","Ctr Hosp Univ Dupuytren, Dept Ophthalmol, Limoges, France","Adenis, JP (reprint author), CHRU Dupuytren, Serv Ophtalmol, 2 Ave Martin Luther King, F-87042 Limoges, France.",,"ROBERT, Pierre-Yves/O-8597-2016",,,,,26,14,16,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0740-9303,,,OPHTHALMIC PLAST REC,Ophthalmic Plast.

The mechanism for this is unknown. During the initial phase of bone implantation the biomaterial comes into direct contact with whole blood. In this study we use a newly developed in vitro chamber model to compare different commonly used biomaterials in contact with whole blood. These materials were selected with respect to their different osteointegrating properties in order to correlate these properties with the response to whole blood. In the presence of 3 IU/ml of heparin only titanium induced macroscopic clotting. This was reflected by the generation of thrombin-antithrombin which was much increased in blood in contact with titanium compared with steel and PVC. The coagulation activation caused by titanium was triggered by the intrinsic pathway because the generation of FXIIa-AT/C1 esterase inhibitor paralleled that of thrombin-antithrombin, and both thrombin-antithrombin complex and FXIIa-AT/C1 esterase inhibitor generation were abrogated by corn trypsin inhibitor, which is a specific inhibitor of FXIIa. The binding of platelets was increased on the titanium surface compared to the other biomaterial surfaces and the state of platelet activation was much more pronounced as reflected by the levels of beta-thromboglobulin and PDGF. This study indicates that titanium is unsuitable as a biomaterial in devices which are in direct contact with blood for a prolonged period. Furthermore, PDGF and other alpha-granule proteins e. g. TGF-beta, are known to be potent promoters of osteogenesis which suggests that the pronounced thrombogenic properties of titanium might contribute to the good osteointegrating properties.","Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Mat Sci, Angstrom Lab, Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Kalmar, Dept Nat Sci, Kalmar, Sweden","Nilsson, B (reprint author), Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012; Andersson, Joakim/A-3017-2009; Nilsson Ekdahl, Kristina/B-5301-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730; Andersson, Joakim/0000-0003-2991-1927; ",,,,42,129,132,0,6,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-6245,2567-689X,,THROMB HAEMOSTASIS,Thromb.

These changes have been shown to be dependent on the biomaterials, techniques, and devices used. In this study the influence of a new cell separator (AMICUS) and storage container (PL-2410) on platelet glycoproteins was analyzed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During plateletpheresis and storage, the levels of platelet glycoproteins and binding of fibrinogen were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: During apheresis, mean channel fluorescence intensity of GD41a did not change significantly (p = 0.06). A small increase was evident in CD42b mean channel fluorescence intensity, which rose from a baseline level of 178.6 +/- 68.3 to 231.5 +/- 97.9 at the end of the procedure (p<0.05); in CD62p-positive platelets, which increased from 2.0 +/- 0.9 percent to 9.9 +/- 3.9 percent (p<0.05); in CD63-positive platelets, which increased from 1.7 +/- 0.7 percent to 7.9 +/- 2.6 percent (p<0.05); and in the binding of fibrinogen, which increased from 1.9 +/- 0.8 percent positive platelets to 10.5 +/- 2.6 percent (p<0.05). During storage, the mean channel fluorescence intensity of CD41a and C-D42b, the percentage of CD62p- and GD63-positive platelets, and the binding of fibrinogen to platelets showed no significant change. CONCLUSION: These studies show that alterations in platelet antigens and platelet activation occur to a small degree during apheresis and storage. These findings demonstrate generally good biocompatibility of this new cell separator.","Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Transfus Med Transplantat Immunol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Hemostaseol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; Baxter Res & Dev Europe, Nivelles, Belgium","Gutensohn, K (reprint author), Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Transfus Med Transplantat Immunol, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,45,6,7,0,1,AMER ASSOC BLOOD BANKS,BETHESDA,"8101 GLENBROOK RD, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2749 USA",0041-1132,,,TRANSFUSION,Transfusion,JUL,1999.0,39,7,,,,,742,747,,10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39070742.x,,,,6,Hematology,Hematology,216EK,WOS:000081428100012,10413282.0,,,,2019-02-25

These structures are primarily adapted to the variety of mechanical functions that bone fulfills. Here we review the structure-mechanical relations of one bone structural type, lamellar bone. This is the most abundant type in many mammals, including humans. A lamellar unit is composed of five sublayers. Each sublayer is an array of aligned mineralized collagen fibrils. The orientations of these arrays differ in each sublayer with respect to both collagen fibril axes and crystal layers, such that a complex rotated plywood-like structure is formed. Specific functions for lamellar bone, as opposed to the other bone types, could not be identified. It is therefore proposed that the lamellar structure is multifunctional-the ""concrete"" of the bone family of materials. Experimentally measured mechanical properties of lamellar bone demonstrate a clear-cut anisotropy with respect to the axis direction of long bones. A comparison of the elastic and ultimate properties of parallel arrays of lamellar units formed in primary bone with cylindrically shaped osteonal structures in secondary formed bone shows that most of the intrinsic mechanical properties are built into the lamellar structure. The major advantages of osteonal bone are its fracture properties. Mathematical modeling of the elastic properties based on the lamellar structure and using a rule-of-mixtures approach can closely simulate the measured mechanical properties, providing greater insight into the structure-mechanical relations of lamellar bone. a 1999 Academic Press.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mat & Interfaces, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Weiner, S (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DEO6954],,,56,379,392,3,136,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1047-8477,,,J STRUCT BIOL,J.

Peptide bond cleavage of the modified inteins generated an N-terminal cysteine and a C-terminal thioester on the same protein, These complementary reactive groups underwent intra- or intermolecular condensation to generate circular or polymeric protein species with a new peptide bond at the site of ligation, Three cyclic peptides, BBP, an organ specific localization peptide; RGD, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation; and CDR-H3/C2, which inhibits HIV-1 replication, were isolated using the two-intein system.

Our study is aimed at developing technology designed to alter the outer atomic layers of a material to give the desired compatibility with the tissue while retaining the properties of the bulk substratum. Materials used in this study were titanium vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) and cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy (Co-Cr). Soda Lime glass discs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) acted as controls. A cathode of either Ti-6Al-4V or Co-Cr was used to simultaneously deposit and implant identified substrata. The attachment of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) to various materials was determined using radiolabeling or colorimetric assays. Results show that HBDC adhere preferentially to the unmodified surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-4V on glass compared to the unmodified Co-Cr surfaces and to that of the Co-Cr on glass. Depositing Ti-6Al-4V on Co-Cr gives significantly better attachment of HBDC than when depositing Co-Cr onto Ti-6Al-4V. While cellular attachment to the created surfaces reflects that of the cathodic materials, it is not identical to these materials. Ion deposition/implantation is capable of creating permanent surfaces which reflect the adhesion of source materials not bulk substrata.

Histiocytes were markedly accumulated around the particles of UHMWPE (11 mu m), Co-Cr (3.9 mu m), SUS316L (3.9 mu m), Co-Cr (0.03 mu m), and titanium alloy (0.03 mu m). Around the UHMWPE particles (99 mu m), a slight histiocytic reaction and bone formation were observed. Particles of alumina ceramics (3.9 mu m) and titanium alloy (3.5 mu m) which were in phagocytosable sizes also had few histiocytic reactions. Statistically, the material difference was more strongly related to the histiocyte reaction than to the particle size and calculated total surface area of particles.

The toxicity of forms of the individual elements released from ASTM F75 Co-Cr-Mo (Co-Cr-Mo), F138 316L stainless steel (316L), and F136 Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-6Al-4V) was first determined, and a mathematical model was developed to predict the toxicity of mixtures of these ions. Aqueous metal solutions were then mixed according to the proportions of the ions found in these alloys, and their toxicity was measured with Microtox. Mixture behavior was classified as synergistic, antagonistic, or additive by comparing measured toxicity to predicted toxicity. Since relating these tests to actual implant corrosion processes can be con founded by selective leaching, the predicted and measured toxicity of aqueous metal solutions mixed according to proportions representative of selective leaching were next determined, and the mixture behaviors were classified as before. The most toxic individual alloying elements were found to be hexavalent Cr, Ni, and Co, in that order: a finding in accord with prior biocompatibility research. Co-Cr-Mo was found to be the most toxic alloy mixture of both those combined according to alloy composition and those combined to reflect selective leaching. The Ti-6Al-4V mixtures were found to behave synergistically, while the Co-Cr-Mo and 316L mixtures behaved antagonistically. By providing insight into degradation product toxicity and elemental interaction, these experiments demonstrate the utility of employing bioluminescent bacterial assays to investigate biocompatibility of implant materials. Further studies to more closely simulate in vivo conditions, though, are required to fully gauge their potential in this regard.

The difference of the binding behavior of protein with that of the immobilized metal ions is also discussed. For the immobilized Fe(III), ITC results show that the adsorption enthalpy at a constant pH value decreased as the NaCl concentration increased and also decreased with the pH values at constant NaCl concentrations. The adsorption enthalpy become negative under higher pH values or higher salt concentrations indicating the adsorption process is partly driven by the enthalpy. The enthalpy of lysozyme with Fe(III) is higher than that with Cu(II) implying that the heat required for the dehydration of Cu(II) is lower than for the dehydration of Fe(III) and/or that the heat generated from the formation of the coordination with Cu(II) is higher than with Fe(III). In addition, the comparison of different immobilized metal ions corresponding to the equilibrium binding affinity suggests that the binding force of lysozyme with Cu(II) is higher than with Fe(III). This study presents the chemical differences between the binding affinity and the adsorption enthalpy of lysozyme interacting with the immobilized metal ions. The binding and thermodynamic data presented in this study elucidate the mechanism and process of lysozyme binding with immobilized metal ions. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristic functions provide valuable information enabling a more thorough understanding of protein adsorption at the immobilized metal ion affinity surface.

Resorption of the ceramic coatings has raised some concern about the behavior of the bone-implant interfaces after the coating disappearance. Substitution of the OH- ions by fluoride in the hydroxylapatite (HA) lattice makes the calcium phosphate more stable. We investigated the degradation rate of dental implants with 50- and 100-mu m coatings of HA, fluorapatite (FA), or fluorhydroxylapatite (FHA), The implants were inserted in dog jaws and retrieved for histological analysis after 3, 6, and 12 months. The thickness of the calcium phosphate coatings was evaluated using an image analysis device. A relative resorption index and its standard deviation were studied. HA and FA coatings (even at 100-mu m thickness) were almost totally degraded within the implantation period. In contrast, the FHA coatings did not show significant degradation during the same period. The standard deviation showed that the resorption process for FHA with thicknesses of 50 or 100 mu m was the same, Such a difference was not observed between the 50- and 100-mu m thick coatings of FA and HA.

They contain various resins that improve their mechanical properties. These modifications, however, may also affect their biocompatibility, We compared the cytotoxicity of seven biomaterials (five RM-GICs, one metal-reinforced GIC (M-GIC), and a zinc-oxyphosphate cement) using an assay of pulp cell viability in vitro (MTT assay). The most toxic materials appeared to be the M-GIC Hi-Dense and the RM-GIC Vitremer, The less toxic ones appeared to be the RM-GICs Compoglass and Photac-Fil, Attempts made to identify the factors responsible for their cytotoxicity indicated that in vitro cytotoxicity did not seem to be caused by any change in pH of the biomaterial eluates. Adsorption of biomaterial eluates on dentin powder significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of all biomaterials. The concentration of F-, Sr2+, and Al3+ (major ionic elements present in GICs) in the eluate of six glass ionomer containing biomaterials was too low to be cytotoxic, However, Cu2+ and Ag+ (present in alloys of M-GIC) were present in toxic concentrations in Hi-Dense eluates, Unpolymerized monomers leached from resins were identified by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy in biomaterial eluates, The monomers hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), and poly(acrylic) acid were identified in eluates of Vitremer, Compoglass, and Hi-Dense, respectively, After ethanol elution of HEMA and TEGDMA from Vitremer and Compoglass, respectively, the cytotoxicity of these two RM-GICs was drastically reduced. Our results suggest that the principal compounds responsible for cytotoxicity are unpolymerized resin monomers in the two RM-GICs and Cu2+ and Ag+ in the M-GIC, (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Fac Chirurg Dentaire, Lab Biol & Physiopathol Craniofaciale, F-92120 Montrouge, France; Univ Paris 06, LASIR, CNRS, Thiais, France","Stanislawski, L (reprint author), Fac Chirurg Dentaire, Lab Biol & Physiopathol Craniofaciale, 1 Rue Maurice Arnoux, F-92120 Montrouge, France.",,,,,,,17,60,64,1,8,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Six different CFRCs of constant pore size (about 30 mu m) were fabricated that had 9, 12, and 17% porosity with 2-nm(3) matrix crystallites and 6, 12, and 20% at 25 nm(3). They were implanted as femoral transverse diaphyseal pins that were 1.5 mm in diameter. At 5 and 45 weeks, implant and bone histologic specimens were evaluated histologically and by a scanning electron microscope and an electron microprobe, Also, regional lymph nodes and spleens were examined. By 45 weeks, direct implant-bone contact was observed over most of the interface in most specimens, At the implant surface, there was partial replacement of CFRC with host tissue. However, the microprobe showed that the implant-bone interface was chemically abrupt with no cross-diffusion of ionic species. Besides the surface effects, there was partial filling of the implant pores with tissue, including bone organized de novo deep within, This was observed histologically and confirmed by microprobe. Lymph nodes and spleens were histologically normal, and no carbon particles were found. None of the results were influenced by porosity or matrix crystallite size over the ranges studied. In summary, these porous CFRCs are partially degraded when in contact with bone and appear substantially tissue compatible. They may be useful as scaffolds for regrowth of bone.

The swelling behavior of the hydrogels in water, alkaline, and acidic media showed a slight decrease in the equilibrium water content with the content of V in the copolymer although in all cases it was superior to an EWC > 20%. The diffusion mechanism followed a Fickian behavior in all media. The values of the diffusion coefficients were in the range 2.5-1.6 10(-7) cm(2)/s. The states of water in the hydrogels were determined by DSC. A decrease in the content of freezing water was obtained with the V content for all media, and for all compositions lower values of freezing water were obtained in acidic or basic pHs than in distilled water. The copolymeric xerogels, analyzed by contact angle measurements, deviated from those expected taking into consideration those of the homopolymers and the average fraction of the monomers in the copolymer. The polar contribution dropped with the introduction of a small content (4 wt %) of the vitamin E-containing monomer, and it reached a value similar to that of poly-V for a composition of 49 wt % of V in the copolymer. This behavior is accounted for by the segregation of the macromolecular chains of both kinds of monomers, due mainly to differences in their polarity, molecular weights, and the reactivity of both monomers. Finally, thermogravimetric analysis showed a higher thermal (antioxidant) stability of the poly-V with respect to poly-H, giving rise to a residue of 18 wt %. The V-containing copolymers also showed an improved stability (antioxidant behavior), indicating the possibility of the V unit's interfering with the oxidative process, based on free-radical species, and, therefore, with the aging process at the cellular level.

As the principal formed element in a thrombus, platelets play a major role in determining the hemocompatibility of mechanical heart valves and other high-shear-rate cardiovascular devices. Since larger animals are required to test many such devices, sheep and porcine platelet responses were compared to humans. Adhesion, spreading, and the formation of thrombilike structures were examined in vitro on pyrolytic carbon mechanical heart valve leaflets, National Institutes of Health-reference polyethylene and silicone rubber, and Formvar. Principal findings were that platelet responses are strongly dependent upon the biomaterial and the species: Porcine and human platelets spread extensively on pyrolytic carbon, formed thrombuslike structures on Formvar, and were least active on silicone rubber. Human and porcine platelets responded differently to polyethylene: Human platelets spread extensively, while porcine platelets remained pseudopodial. In contrast sheep platelets attached much less, never reached fully spread shapes, and were far less active overall. Since porcine responses were generally similar to humans, pigs may be a useful predictor of in vivo platelet-biomaterial interaction in humans. Conversely, as ovine platelets were much less active, this must be accounted for in the evaluation of cardiovascular devices tested in sheep.

We hypothesized that potential for S. aureus to cause an ocular infection would be enhanced if these bacteria are able to adhere to the biomaterials used in contact lenses. In turn, bacterial adhesion could also be influenced by other factors, such as properties of contact lenses and the absorbance of some tear components. We investigated the effect of the tear protein lysozyme on S. aureus adhesion to contact lenses and its effect on production of toxins or enzymes. Methods: Bacterial adhesion on contact lenses was determined by counting the total number of bacteria as well as viable bacteria on iysozyme-coated or non-coated lenses, and by counting bacteria grown in the presence or absence of lysozyme in the medium. Toxin and enzyme production was assessed by haemolysis and proteolysis assays. Results: Our results indicate that adhesion was significantly increased in the presence of lysozyme, both in the medium and coated onto contact lenses (P = 0.04). The presence of lysozyme did not alter the production of alpha- or beta- toxins. However; the presence of lysozyme inhibited elastase activity. Conclusion: These results indicate that lysozyme deposition on contact lenses promoted S. aureus adhesion. The tear protein lysozyme might modify elastase activity and thus modulate the production of corneal degradation resulting from the action of this enzyme.","Univ New S Wales, Cornea & Contact Lens Res Unit, Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Thakur, A (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Cornea & Contact Lens Res Unit, Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,,"willcox, mark/0000-0003-3842-7563",,,,21,20,21,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0814-9763,,,AUST NZ J OPHTHALMOL,Aust.

The resulting matrix is a three-dimensional scaffold consisting of interconnected pores with an average size of 40 mu m and a high pore volume/surface area ratio. The covalent nature of the bond between the collagen fibers and the modified hyaluronate was demonstrated by extended elution with phosphate buffered saline and by extraction in increasing ionic gradients. The fraction of covalently bound hyaluronate in the matrix ranged from 5 to 25 w%. The total hyaluronate content of the COL/HA matrix affected both the in vitro non-enzymatic and enzymatic degradation as well as the in vivo turnover. When implanted in cranial defects in rats, the COL/HA matrix demonstrated good biocompatibility and exhibited greater osteoconductive potential than matrices composed of either cross-linked collagen or cross-linked hyaluronate alone.

Because the fibrinogen bound to them is functional in the classic sense of fibrin gelation, the coated microparticles may have potential as vehicles for the targeted delivery of various molecules to sites of fibrin(ogen) deposition in vivo. So that we could assess directly this potential, we first established a method for eliciting reproducibly a focal, fibrin(ogen)-rich, inflammatory lesion in a hind footpad of mice. We then monitored the tissue distribution of fibrinogen-coated microparticles following their injection into the tail vein of mice bearing this well-defined lesion. As happens with most microparticles following their intravenous administration, liposomes and oil droplets, whether coated with fibrinogen or not, accumulate rapidly in the liver and spleen of treated animals, Indeed, in the case of oil droplets, accumulation of fibrinogen-coated microparticles in those organs and in the lungs is even greater than that of fibrinogen-free microparticles, However, as distinct from fibrinogen-free liposomes and oil droplets, fibrinogen-coated microparticles also accumulate in the inflamed hind footpad. We conclude that fibrinogen-coated liposomes and oil droplets do have potential as vehicles for delivering molecules to sites of fibrin(ogen) deposition in vivo.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA","DeAnglis, AP (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",,,,,,,49,6,6,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-4513,1470-8744,,BIOTECHNOL APPL BIOC,Biotechnol.

Methods Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation was conducted by one surgeon on 86 subjects (aged 50-89 years) with cataracts. Of these subjects, 67 completed the study. Subjects were implanted either with a foldable IOL (n = 38) or a rigid IOL (n = 29), Best corrected Snellen visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (2-28 cycles/degree) were measured approximately 2 months postoperatively. Comparisons were made between the pseudophakic groups and an additional group of 28 age-matched, normal subjects (aged 58-81 years). Non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U) as well as parametric (ANOVA and Pearson) statistics tests were used in the analysis of results. Results All pseudophakes had corrected visual acuity of 6/9 or better. There were no significant differences in visual acuity (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.61) or contrast sensitivity (ANOVA, p = 0.33) between the three groups. The mean residual refractive error of the foldable IOL group was hypermetropic in comparison with the rigid IOL group but not significant at the 99% level of probability (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in astigmatism between the groups. Conclusions Implanting a foldable acrylic IOL gave no post-operative benefit in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity to pseudophakes over a less expensive rigid PMMA IOL, within this post-operative period. This study did not provide a comparison between the two lenses regarding post-operative complications, in particular the important long-term complication of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Until and if any particular advantage of a given IOL in reduced incidence of PCO is confirmed, it appears more economical to implant the conventional rigid PMMA IOL using small-incision surgery.","Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Vis Sci, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Birmingham, Acad Unit Ophthalmol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; So Gen Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Glasgow G51 4TF, Lanark, Scotland","Afsar, AJ (reprint author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Vis Sci, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,27,18,18,1,4,ROYAL COLL OPHTHALMOLOGISTS,LONDON,"17 CORNWALL TERRACE, LONDON NW1 4QW, ENGLAND",0950-222X,,,EYE,Eye,JUN,1999.0,13,,3A,,,,329,335,,,,,,7,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,215GV,WOS:000081374300009,10624427.0,,,,2019-02-25

Indeed, such polymers, which can be synthesized through different chemical and biological routes, have cleavable ester beads in their backbone for hydrolytic degradation, stereogenic centres in the monomers units for controlling the macromolecular structure, bioassimilable or non-toxic repeating units and lateral chemical functions which can be adapted to specific requirements. The strategy for building such complex architectures, with one or several specific pendant groups, is based on the anionic ring-opening polymerization or copolymerization of the large family of malolactonic and 3-alkylmalolactonic acid esters. Because we are able to control the monomer synthesis and the polymerization step, we have been able to prepare different degradable materials for the biomedical field; such as: degradable associating networks made up by the association of random copolyesters containing a small percentage of hydrophobic moieties and beta-cyclodextrin copolymers; degradable macromolecular micelles constituted by degradable amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(beta-malic acid) as hydrophilic segments and poly(beta-alkylmalic acid alkyl esters) as hydrophobic blocks; and degradable nanoparticles made up by hydrophobic poly(beta-malic acid alkyl esters) derivatives. We have also prepared a terpolymer which exhibits growth factor-like properties in vivo. Finally, poly-(beta-malic acid) has been used as an additive in the preparation of peritoneal dialysis bags.

A finite element analysis was used to determine the stress distribution along the cavo-surface margin which results from occlusal loading of each restoration. The cyclic crack growth rate of sub-surface flaws located along the dentinal cavo-surface margin were determined utilizing the Paris law. Based on similarities in material properties and lack of fatigue property data for dental biomaterials, the cyclic fatigue crack growth parameters for engineering ceramics were used to approximate the crack growth behavior. It was found that flaws located within the dentine along the buccal and lingual margins can significantly reduce the fatigue life of restored teeth. Sub-surface cracks as short as 25 mu m were found capable of promoting tooth fracture well within 25 years from the time of restoration. Furthermore, cracks longer than 100 mu m reduced the fatigue life to less than 5 years. Consequently, sub-surface cracks introduced during cavity preparation with conventional dental burrs may serve as a principal source for premature restoration failure.

A mixed amelogenin preparation extracted from porcine developing enamel matrix (containing ""25K,"" 7.4%; ""23K,"" 10.7%; ""20K,"" 49.5%; and smaller peptides, 32.4%) was dissolved in dilute formic acid and reprecipitated by adjusting the pH to 6.8 with NaOH solution. Amelogenin gels were formed in vitro by sedimenting the precipitate in microcentrifuge tubes. The gels were fixed with Karnovsky fixative at 4 and 24 degrees C, which was found to preserve their corresponding clear (4 degrees C) and opaque (24 degrees C) states. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were employed for the microstructural characterization of the fixed clear and opaque gels. The amelogenin gel matrix was observed to possess a hierarchical structure of quasi-spherical amelogenin nanospheres and their assemblies. The nanospheres of diameters 8-20 nm assemble to form small spherical assemblies of diameters 40-70 nm that further aggregated to form large spherical assemblies of 70-300 nm in diameter. In the clear gel, most of the large assemblies are smaller than 150 nm, and the nanospheres and assemblies are uniformly dispersed, allowing an even fluid distribution among them. In the opaque gel, however, numerous spherical fluid-filled spaces ranging from 0.3 to 7 mu m in diameter were observed with the majority of the large assemblies sized 150-200 nm in diameter. These spaces presumably result from enhanced hydrophobic interactions among nanospheres and/or assemblies as the temperature increased. The high opacity of the opaque (24 degrees C) gel apparently arises from the presence of the numerous fluid-filled spaces observed compared to the low-temperature (4 degrees C) preparation. These observations suggest that the hydrophobic interactions among nanospheres and different orders of amelogenin assemblies are important in determining the structural integrity of the dental enamel matrix.

Upon confluency, the cell density was calculated and cell viability determined. All monolayers were stained with phalloidin-rhodamine for F-actin and antibodies to the tight junction (zonula occludens) protein, ZO(1), to demonstrate the presence of tight junctions. The final cell density of human RPE monolayers on PLLA films was 2950 cells/mm(2) (+/-185).

F-actin staining revealed a circumferential ring of actin filaments in all of the cells grown on substrates.

With the development of new disciplines within biomaterials research such as tissue engineering and cellular therapy, information at molecular and structural levels is needed in order to conceive and design biomaterials that elicit specific, functional cell responses. In this study we determined the formation of focal adhesions and fibronectin fibrillar structures by human fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells adhered to fibronectin-precoated, smooth, and textured silicones as a function of time. Textures consisted of parallel ridges and 0.5 mu m deep grooves with a width of 2, 5, and 10 mu m. In addition, pillar and well constructs were used. Cells assembled focal adhesions within the first 24 h of adhesion. Fibronectin production and assembly resulted in a dense fibrillar network at day 6. Initial focal adhesion density and size were dictated by the presence of the texture. Topography also influenced initial fibronectin deposition, although the differences did not result in apparent differences in fibronectin networks after 6 days of incubation. Without fibronectin preadsorption, cells did not proliferate on the silicone surfaces. Cells adhered to glass removed all the preadsorbed fibronectin, whereas on silicone they did not. The present study shows that different textures initially give rise to differences in focal contact and fibronectin fibril assembly. The effects of the small, initial in vitro differences on in vivo tissue biocompatibility remains to be studied.","Univ Groningen, Dept Biomed Engn, Groningen, Netherlands; Ohio State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,,,,,,70,51,51,0,13,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-4947,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,JUN,1999.0,5,3,,,,,223,240,,,,,,18,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,211UC,WOS:000081179400004,10434070.0,,,,2019-02-25

Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells. Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues. The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems. The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly a-hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA). Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells. The pre shaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step. Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4 mm, articular joint defects of rabbits. Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix. 80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo. However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue. These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction. The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.","Dept Rheumatol Charite, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; German Rheumatism Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; German Rheumatism Res Ctr, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Dept Orthoped Charite, D-10098 Berlin, Germany","Sittinger, M (reprint author), Dept Rheumatol Charite, Tucholskystr 2, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,21,52,59,0,11,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,DARMSTADT,"PLATZ DER DEUTSCHEN EINHEIT 25, D-64293 DARMSTADT, GERMANY",0340-1855,,,Z RHEUMATOL,Z.

The presence of an amino group also makes it one of the most straightforward to functionalize. Unfortunately however, it tends to form micelles and hexagonal clusters instead of forming lamellar systems such as sheets and vesicles (liposomes), key supramolecular structures for a variety of biomedical and other technical applications. This has been overcome by synthesizing a dimeric phosphatidyl ethanolamine molecule in which the acyl chains at the 2-position of glycerol are joined at their termini by a carbon-carbon bond, thus resulting in a trans-membrane type fatty acyl linkage. Such tail-to-tail bipolar transmembrane lipids are found in the membranes of thermophilic and other extremophilic bacteria. The dimeric phosphatidyl ethanolamine readily forms very uniformly flat self-assembled lamellar supramolecular arrays and liposomes that are stable at temperatures up to 80 degrees C. The planar systems formed by the new lipid were characterized by atomic force microscopy, and the uniformity of the vesicles was observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, The thermal stability of the phospholipid and the vesicles formed was examined by NMR spectroscopy including proton T-1 measurements as a function of temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated a much greater order of the alkyl chain in the dimer than in phosphatidyl ethanolamine. This extremely stable and readily functionalizable dimeric phospholipid has potential uses in the fabrication of biomaterials, stable membrane models, and liposome drug-delivery systems.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Hollingsworth, RI (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,40,26,26,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0022-3263,,,J ORG CHEM,J.

The stability of these systems, however, is compromised when operating above the phase transition temperature of the lipid component, as well as in the presence of albumin.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Lab Biomol Mat Res, Dept Surg, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Chaikof, EL (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Lab Biomol Mat Res, Dept Surg, 1364 Clifton Rd,NE,Box M-11, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,36,32,32,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 25,1999.0,15,11,,,,,3866,3874,,10.1021/la980990q,,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,201RY,WOS:000080610400026,,,,,2019-02-25

Much work has been done on the use of a wide variety of cryoprotectant compounds for these types of processes. Chief among these compounds are the saccharides. They have been found to protect proteins during freezing and drying stresses as well as prevent membrane damage during cooling of cells. Trehalose, a naturally occurring disaccharide of glucose, has been found to be a particularly effective cryoprotectant. Although there are several prevailing structural and thermodynamic arguments as to why molecules such as trehalose act as cryoprotectants, little fundamental work has been done to corroborate or refute these hypotheses. To address this issue, our work has focused on the structural and dynamic simulation of this promising cryoprotective system. In this work, we have implemented fully flexible, all-atom models for water and trehalose and used both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics algorithms to calculate various macroscopic properties of trehalose solutions over a wide range of concentration. We have also studied the glass transition behavior at various concentrations and compared it to experimental data. We have observed the existence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which has been invoked to explain compressibility and molar volume data for concentrated solutions of trehalose. We have studied the diffusivity of water molecules in concentrated trehalose solutions and found a gradual transition from continuous motion through the matrix in more diluted systems to cavity-hopping motion in concentrated and near-glassy cases. Our diffusivity results have been analyzed in terms of the Williams-Landel-Feny equation; good agreement is found with published glass transition data.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","de Pablo, JJ (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem Engn, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,44,113,115,2,27,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5639,,,J PHYS CHEM A,J.

The effect of HA loadings and various thermal processing conditions on the crystallinity of the PEEK polymer and its composites were investigated using two different methods, i.e, density analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). From density analysis, it was observed that HA loadings did not influence the crystallinity of the composites as compared to DSC, which indicated that the crystallinity increased slightly with IIA loadings. Thermal processing parameters such as melt temperature, residence time and cooling rate was found to influence the structural characteristics of HA reinforced PEEK composites. In general, increasing the thermal processing parameter resulted in a decrease in crystallinity. A similar trend was observed for both the techniques used. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

These materials are chosen because they are widely used in the held of orthopedic surgery. Contact angles (sessile drop) and surface tension (du Nouy's ring method) are measured in standardized conditions which take into account the various parameters disturbing wetting phenomena. An original cumulative deposits method (CDM) described here permits observation of the evolution of the wettability and allows estimation of the protein adhesion rate. Two families of materials emerge according to their behavior when they are in contact with the protein solution. One set (a chromium cobalt alloy and two polyethylenes) presents no detectable adhesion. The other set (stainless steel, zirconia, alumina, virgin and nitrogen implanted titanium alloy) shows a cumulative adhesion of proteins. We propose to adopt a BSA buffered solution as a referential sensor to characterize solid surfaces. From the CDM, the practical parameter P*, called the adhesive wettability power, can be used in order to analyze and classify biomaterials.

Attachment of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may add to these characteristics and valorize collagen. In this study, porous type I collagen matrices were crosslinked using dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment and/or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), in the presence and absence of chondroitin sulphate (CS). EDC covalently attaches CS to collagen. DHT crosslinking preserved a porous matrix structure. However, attachment of CS to DHT-treated matrices using EDC, resulted in collapsed surfaces, CS located only at the matrix exterior. EDC crosslinking resulted in a partial matrix collapse. This could be prevented if crosslinking was carried out in the presence of ethanol. Matrix porosity was then preserved. The presence of CS during EDC crosslinking resulted in covalent immobilization of CS throughout the matrix. The amount of CS incorporated was increased if crosslinking was performed in the presence of ethanol. EDC-crosslinked matrices, with and without CS, had increased denaturation temperatures and decreased flee amine group contents. The susceptibility of these matrices towards degradation by proteolytic enzymes was diminished. Immobilized CS increased the water-binding capacity and decreased the denaturation temperature and tensile strength. Immobilized CS bound anti-CS antibodies and was susceptible to chondroitinase ABC digestion, demonstrating its bioavailability. The modified matrices were not cytotoxic as was established using human myoblast and fibroblast culture systems. It is concluded that the use of ethanol during EDC crosslinking offers an elegant means for the preparation of defined porous collagenous matrices containing bioavailable, covalently attached CS.

BD90 had a tensile strength of 2.6 MPa and an elongation at break of only 93%. To improve the resistance to enzymes and to retain the favorable tensile properties, BD45 was post-treated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to give BD45EN. Additional cross-linking via the formation of amide bonds took place as indicated by the T-s of 81 degrees C and the residual number of amine groups of 19 (n/1000). BD45EN was stable during exposure to both collagenase and pronase solutions. The tensile properties (tensile strength 7.2 MPa, elongation at break 100%) were comparable to those of BD45 and glutaraldehyde treated controls (G-DSC). Acylation of the residual amine groups of BD45 with acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (HAc-NHS) yielded BD45HAc with a large reduction in amine groups to 10 (n/1000) and a small reduction in T-s to 62 degrees C.

Every one of these procedures requires some period of contact with blood with several different biomaterials used in the manufacture of assist devices or implant devices. In view of the increasing importance of the biomaterials in clinical practice, it would be timely to review briefly physicochemical characterization as well as biological evaluations. Blood compatibility encompasses a variety of events associated with blood interaction with the biomaterials used in various procedures. Two separate coagulation mechanisms are involved (arterial and venous) depending upon the flow characteristics. At least three Interacting factors modulate normal hemostasis and the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events. They are the state of activation of coagulation cascade, circulating levels of thrombin and fibrinogen and relative activity of platelets. In this overview we discuss the current concepts on the role of platelets in blood-biomaterial interactions. When blood contacts a biomaterial surface a variety of blood components interact with the surface. Some of the key players in platelet activation on biomaterial surface include fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Currently available antiplatelet drugs effectively block aggregation and secretion induced by physiological agonists such as epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane in suspension. However, they do not prevent platelet interaction on biomaterial surfaces. Mechanisms involved in platelet activation In suspension and on surfaces as well as the pharmacology of newer antiplatelet drugs will be discussed.","Univ Minnesota, Acad Hlth Ctr, Inst Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Rao, GHR (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Acad Hlth Ctr, Inst Biomed Engn, PB 609 UMHC,420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,"Rao, Gundu H.R./0000-0002-2692-7950",,,,35,12,13,0,12,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0250-4707,0973-7669,,B MATER SCI,Bull.

Dacron-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir patches (n = 5) and control Dacron-BSA patches (n = 5) were implanted in series in the thoracic aortas of canines. These patches were exposed to nonheparinized, arterial blood flow for 2 hours. Patches were explanted and assessed for I-125-rHir loss. Antithrombin activity of explanted 1-cm(2) patch segments was evaluated using a chromogenic assay with 1, 5, 10, 15 units of added thrombin. Light microscopy was performed to qualitatively examine the pseudointima. Two animals were excluded from the study owing to excessive bleeding through the knitted I-125- rHir patch. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative I-125-rHir gamma counts revealed an overall decrease of 20 +/- 5.4% over the period studied. Explanted I-125-rHir patch segments were able to inhibit 1, 5, and 7 NIHU of thrombin, demonstrating retained antithrombin activity. Gross and microscopic examination of the control and test Dacron surfaces showed marked differences. Dacron surfaces with covalently bound I-125-rHir had no gross thrombus and a thin pseudointima of platelets and plasma proteins. In contrast, the control patches had a thick pseudointima composed of fibrin-rich thrombus. rHir, covalently bound to Dacron patches, maintains its biologic activity as well as prevents thrombus formation on the graft surface. This novel antithrombin coating, by modifying the blood/ graft interface, may improve both short- and long-term patency in small-diameter prosthetic arterial grafts and has applications with respect to other implantable or indwelling biomaterials.

During the last few years, much attention has been paid to hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate as potential biomaterials for bone substitute. A good implantation of biomaterials in the skeleton is to reach full integration of non-living implant with living bone. The aim of this study is to compare the resorption kinetics of four kinds of calcium phosphate ceramics: hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)), hydroxyapatite doped with manganese or zinc and a composite material of 75% hydroxyapatite and 25% beta-tricalcium phosphate (Ca-3(PO4)(2)) Cylinders (5-6 mm in diameter) of these ceramics were packed into holes made in the femur diaphysis of mature ovine. At 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after the operation, bone/implant interface was embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. We used the PIXE method (particle induced X-ray emission) to measure the distribution of mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Mn and Fe) at the bone/implant interface. At 4, 8; 16, 28 and 48 weeks after implantation we studied a biopsy of the ceramics by neutron activation method. Then, we have a global measurement of mineral elements in the biomaterial. The results showed that the resorption kinetics of hydroxyapatite doped with zinc was faster than that of the three other bioceramics.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 2, France; Lab Phys Corpusculaire Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IN2P3, F-63177 Aubiere, France; Inst Phys Nucl Expt, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Soc Ind Bioland, F-31100 Toulouse, France","Jallot, E (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader, F-51685 Reims 2, France.",,,,,,,21,26,26,0,6,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-0042,,,EUR PHYS J-APPL PHYS,Eur.

Recently, we have shown that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 can independently induce human macrophage fusion to form FBGC via a macrophage mannose receptor (MR) -mediated pathway. The MR is believed to mediate both endocytosis of glycoproteins and phagocytosis of microorganisms, which bear terminal mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or glucose residues. Polarization of microfilaments to closely apposed macrophage membranes as observed with fluorescence confocal microscopy led us to ask whether MR-mediated fusion occurred via a filamentous actin-dependent pathway. Cytochalasins B and D and latrunculin-A, agents that disrupt microfilaments, inhibited macrophage fusion in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of cytochalasins D and B that inhibited fusion did not significantly decrease macrophage adhesion, spreading, or motility but did inhibit internalization of Candida albicans during interleukin-13-enhanced, MR-mediated phagocytosis, Very low concentrations of cytochalasin B (< 2 mu M) induced a slight enhancement of macrophage fusion, Taken together, the results of this study suggest that cytokine-induced, MR-mediated macrophage fusion requires an intact F-actin cytoskeleton and that the mechanism of fusion is similar to phagocytosis.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Anderson, JM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, 2085 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 55714],,,53,47,47,0,4,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,MAY,1999.0,13,8,,,,,823,832,,,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,197NZ,WOS:000080372500006,10224226.0,,,,2019-02-25

The main method used to make medical implants radiologically visible is based on blending polymers with conventional radiopaque agents, blends which usually are a physical mixture of acrylic derivatives and inorganic salts, Other methods reported involve either the formation of single-phase radiopaque polymer salt complexes somehow preventing the release of the radiopacifying element by entrapment of the complex in a crosslinked network, or radiopaque polymerized monomers characterized by a radiopacifying element associated with the monomer unit prior to polymerization, In the near future, research will certainly concentrate on biocompatible radiopaque polymers,vith covalently bound opaque elements leading to stable polymers with properties equivalent to the nonopaque, parent polymer.","Univ Geneva, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Div Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Geneva, Switzerland","Doelker, E (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, 30 Quai E Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,,,,,134,38,38,1,30,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0020-9996,,,INVEST RADIOL,Invest.

The surface chemistry of each substrate was defined by X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy, surface wettability by the dispersive, and the polar components of the surface energies. Osteoclast adhesion was modulated by the polar component of the surface energy: fewer (p < 0.01) osteoclasts adhered to C-HA (97 +/- 20/slice, surface energy 9 +/- 5 mJ/m(2)) than to HA (234 +/- 16/slice, surface energy 44 +/- 2 mJ/m(2)) or to C (268 +/- 37/slice, surface energy 58 +/- 0.5 mJ/m(2)). Actin rings, which are the cytoskeletal structure essential for re-sorption, developed on all three materials. The area of the actin ring, which is resorbed by local acidification, and the osteoclast area, which reflects osteoclast spreading, were both greater in osteoclasts cultured on IIA and C-HA than in those cultured on C. C was resorbed, hut HA and C-HA were not. Thus, we surface energy plays an Essential role in osteoclast adhesion, whereas osteoclast spreading may depend on the surface chemistry, especially on protein adsorption and/or on newly formed apatite layers. Resorption may be limited to the solubility of the biomaterial.

The materials characterization, enzymatic degradability and peptide (insulin) release from solutions of the copolymers were examined. Distribution of bioactive peptides within the polymer chain is well-known for combinations of PEG and polysaccharides as aqueous polymer two-phase systems. Insulin was preferentially partitioned into the PEG phase in a PEG/HA solution system. Enzymatic degradation of the copolymers was strongly dependent on the PEG content. Thermal analysis revealed that PEG-g-HA exhibited a variation in phase-separated structures depending on the PEG content. The solution of PEG-g-HA enabled insulin to remain in the PEG moieties dispersed in the HA matrix. Leakage of insulin from the copolymers was dependent upon the PEG content. Leakage rate of insulin from copolymer containing between 7 and 39% by weight of PEG were similar. A dramatic increase in leakage rate occurred when the PEG content was increased to greater than 39% by weight. It is considered that the loaded insulin was partitioned into the PEG moieties and became entangled with the PEG chains. The conformational change of insulin was effectively prevented in PEG-g-HA solutions, although insulin was denatured in storage of both phosphate buffered solution and HA solution. Such a heterogeneous-structured polymeric solution may be advantageous as an injectable therapeutic formulation for ophthalmic or arthritis treatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

DLC and GDT may affect the surfaces of MHV in many ways, including cleaning of organic and inorganic debris, generating reactive and functional groups on the surface layers without affecting their bulk properties, and making the surfaces more adherent to endothelial cells and albumin and less adherent to platelets.

The effects of shape, size distribution, sedimentation, particle-particle magnetic interactions, and agglomeration were investigated and found to be either negligible or easily determined.

The aim of this study was to compare the behavior of two types of biomaterial widely used in clinical practice, polypropylene (PL) and polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), after a second laparotomy involving the implant, The behavior, in terms of tensile resistance and integration with tissues, of intact prostheses was compared to that of prostheses subjected to opening and repair. Methods: A defect (7 x 5 cm) involving all tissue layers was created in the anterior abdominal wall of 24 male New Zealand rabbits. These defects were repaired with a reticular, macroporous PL mesh (Marlex, Bard Card., Madrid, Spain) or a laminar, micro/macroporous ePTFE prosthesis (Mycro Mesh, W.L, Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) of similar size to the defect. Four study groups were established: Intact PL/Intact ePTFE (n=6 each): animals implanted with a PL or ePTFE prosthesis and sacrificed 90 days after implant; Repaired PL/Repaired ePTFE (n=6 each): animals implanted with a PL or ePTFE prosthesis subjected to midlongitudinal relaparotomy through the center of the prosthesis 90 days postimplant, followed by repair with continuous polypropylene 4/0 suture. Animals in repaired groups were sacrificed 90 days after the second intervention. Specimens comprised of prosthesis and neoformed tissue were subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, 2 cm-wide strips, consisting of the prosthesis and anchorage tissue, were subjected to biomechanical analysis using an Instron tensiometer (Instron, Canton, MA). The results obtained were statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: The intact PL implants were fully infiltrated by dense,disorganized, well-vascularized scar tissue with fibers concentric to the mesh monofilaments. The appearance of the repaired FL prostheses was similar, with establishment of neoformed tissue in repaired areas of the prosthesis such that both cut edges of the prosthesis were joined together. In contrast, intact ePTFE prostheses were encapsulated by organized tissue with fibers running parallel to the surface of the biomaterial. Repaired ePTFE prostheses including sutured areas were similarly encapsulated. But the edges of the sutured middle area did not fuse. Tensile resistance values of intact and repaired PL prostheses were similar (intact, mean, 34.78 Newtons; repaired, mean, 34.74N, p > 0.001). Tensile resistance values of intact ePTFE implants were significantly different to those of the repaired ePTFE prostheses (intact, mean, 22.64N; repaired, mean, 17.21N, p < 0.001), Breakage of both types of PL specimen strips was restricted to recipient tissue while breakage of intact ePTFE specimens occurred in the areas of anchorage to the abdominal wall. Rupture of repaired ePTFE specimens took place in the sutured central areas of the prostheses. Conclusions: We conclude that relaparotomy through an existing PL prosthesis previously integrated with the abdominal wall does not affect the tissue integration process or the tensile resistance of the implant. When the relaparotomy involves an ePTFE prosthesis, however, although the repair process itself is unaffected, significant loss in tensile strength is incurred. In addition, relaparotomy through both types of biomaterial is likely to result in the neoformation of adhesions in the areas of the prosthesis subjected to opening and repair but, in general, the number of adhesions formed in the presence of intact or repaired polypropylene implants was larger than that observed with the use of ePTFE.

Modern biomaterials could be composed of various components, e.g. metals, ceramics, natural tissues, polymers. In this last group, the hydrogels, hydrophilic polymeric gels with requested biocompatibility and designed interaction with living surrounding seem to be one of the most promising group of biomaterials. Especially, if they are formed by means of ionizing radiation. In early 1950s, the pioneers of the radiation chemistry of polymers began some experiments with radiation crosslinking of hydrophilic polymers. However, hydrogels were analyzed mainly from the point of view of the phenomenon associated with radiation synthesis, with topology of network and relation between radiation parameters of the processes. Fundamental monographs on radiation polymer physics and chemistry written by A. Charlesby (Atomic Radition and polymers, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1960) and A. Chapiro (Radiation Chemistry of Polymeric Systems, Interscience, New York, 1962) proceed from this time. The noticeable interest in the application of radiation techniques to obtain hydrogels for biomedical purposes began in the late sixties as a result of the papers and patents invented by Japanese and American scientists, headed by Kaetsu in Japan and Hoffman in USA. Immobilization of biologically active species in hydrogel matrices, their use as drug delivery systems and enzyme traps as well as the modification of material surfaces to improve biocompatibility and their ability to bond antigens and antibodies had been the main subjects of these investigations. In this article a brief summary of investigations on mechanism and kinetics of radiation formation of hydrogels as well as some examples of commercialized hydrogel biomaterials have been presented.

That means that the phenomena which seats at the interface between the implant and the host tissues does not induce neither any deleterious effect, such as chronic inflammatory response, nor the formation of unusual tissues. Thus it is of paramount importance to design biomaterials, used for the fabrication of implants, with the best appropriate surface properties. At the same time these biomaterials must feature bulk properties which meet other requirements, especially mechanical properties, deriving from the intended function of the implant in which they are involved. As it is quite impossible to design biomaterials which fulfil at the same time both types of requirements, it is commonly agreed that the solution to this issue goes through the selection or the design of biomaterials with adequate bulk properties, and a further treatment of the surface which would improve the properties of the latter. In this respect ionizing radiations and plasma based treatments, offer a wide panel of possibilities; as an example we describe here how the surface of expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) samples can be activated using cold plasma, in order to open a way to chemical modifications of such a surface. Subsequently, Radio Frequency Glow Discharge (RFGD) containing oligopeptides, known for their role in mediating the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, were bound to the modified surface, and the affinity of endothelial cells for the latter was investigated.

In order to reduce their thrombogenicity which remains the major obstacle, polymeric materials endowed with a specific affinity for Antithrombin III (ATIII) and thus able to catalyse the inhibition of thrombin by ATIII, as heparin does, were devised. Sulfonate and sulfonamide groups were introduced on phenyl rings belonging to styrene residues which were radiation grafted (swift heavy ions and gamma radiation) onto poly(vinylene difluoride) (PVDF) and poly(hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride) (P(VDF-HFP)). Contrary to gamma radiation grafting, with swift heavy ions grafting, only small regions are modified; thus, the properties of the initial substrate are preserved. A characterization of surface topography was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy. The efficacy of the surface modification was monitored with respect to the total amount of bound ""heparin-like"" molecules measured by a toluidine blue assay, and the anticoagulant potential estimated by the thrombin time test.

To facilitate the fabrication of complex biomaterial surfaces, we have previously described the synthesis and application of a poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) block copolymer (PLA-PEG) with the biotinylated PEG end groups (final polymer termed PLA-PEG-biotin). This polymer is biodegradable and resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, and the biotin moiety allows surface chemical engineering to be achieved using avidin-biotin interactions. Here, we describe a detailed surface analysis of this polymer using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. This analysis has revealed that the avidin-biotin surface engineering strategy is a rapid method of immobilizing biomolecules at biomaterial surfaces under aqueous conditions. The surface engineering generates a specific and high-density change in surface structure. The effect of PLA segment molecular weight and the influence of the surfactant on the nature of the surface engineering has been determined with the objective of proving that the extent of specific ligand immobilization is controllable and resilient to surface stabilization by surfactants.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009","Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,24,74,76,0,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,APR 27,1999.0,15,9,,,,,3157,3161,,10.1021/la9803575,,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,192YG,WOS:000080106900023,,,,,2019-02-25

We used optical reflectometry to measure the extent and kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption to smooth spin-cast films prepared from two poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) samples that have different end-groups, one being a hydrophilic carboxylic end group and the other a hydrophobic ester end group. One of us has previously shown that these end-groups influence microsphere degradation (Tracy et al., 1998, Factors affecting the degradation rate of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres in vivo and in vitro. Biomaterials: submitted for publication.). Both films were moderately hydrophobic, and their wettability was independent of the type of end-group. BSA adsorbed readily to both native PLG films, attaining as much as 50% surface coverage by area and was insensitive to the type of end-group. Aging the films in water for 24 h prior to BSA exposure decreased the hydrophobicity of the films and this in turn correlated with a significant decrease in the initial BSA adsorption rate. This was consistent with the often-observed trend that surface hydrophobicity favors protein adsorption. In spite of the lower adsorption affinity revealed by this decreased initial adsorption rate, the final adsorbed amounts on the aged films exceeded those attained on native films, presumably due to the increase in total surface area produced by partial PLG erosion.

But attempts to imprint proteins have met with only limited success(11-15). Here we report a method for imprinting surfaces with protein-recognition sites. We use radio-frequency glow-discharge plasma deposition to form polymeric thin films(16) around proteins coated with disaccharide molecules. The disaccharides become covalently attached to the polymer film, creating polysaccharide-like cavities that exhibit highly selective recognition for a variety of template proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, ribonuclease and streptavidin, Direct imaging of template recognition is achieved by patterning a surface at the micrometre scale with imprinted regions.","Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ratner, BD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Box 351720, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Tsai, Wei-Bor/B-7953-2011",,,,,31,522,563,6,225,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,APR 15,1999.0,398,6728,,,,,593,597,,,,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,186WX,WOS:000079754700050,10217142.0,,,,2019-02-25

Consideration of this phenotype suggested to us that the foreign body reaction (FBR) might be altered in thrombospondin 2 (TSP2)-null mice. To investigate the participation of TSP2 in the FBR, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and oxidized PDMS (ox-PDMS) disks were implanted in TSP2-null and control mice. Growth of TSP2-null and control skin fibroblasts in vitro also was evaluated on both types of disks. Normal fibroblasts grew as a monolayer on both surfaces, but attachment of the cells to ox-PDMS was weak and sensitive to movement. TSP2-null fibroblasts grew as aggregates on both surfaces, and their attachment was further compromised on ox-PDMS. After a 4-week implantation period, both types of PDMS elicited a similar FBR with a collagenous capsule in both TSP2-null and control mice, However, strikingly, the collagenous capsule that formed in TSP2-null mice was highly vascularized and thicker than that formed in normal mice. In addition, abnormally shaped collagen fibers were observed in capsules from mutant mice. These observations indicate that the presence or absence of an extracellular matrix component, TSP2, can influence the nature of the FBR, in particular its vascularity. The expression of TSP2 therefore could represent a molecular target for local inhibitory measures when vascularization of the tissue surrounding an implanted device is desired.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bornstein, P (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Box 357350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE08229]; NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL018645, HL18645]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296]",,,37,116,117,0,1,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

An electrochemical method, using cytochrome c as redox probe, to assay the formation of the ds-oligonucleotide assembly, is described. The 5'-carboxylic acid-functionalized oligonucleotide (5) is coupled to a cystamine monolayer associated with an Au-electrode. The electrostatic attraction of cytochrome c to the ds-oligonucleotide complex facilitates the interfacial electron transfer to cytochrome c. Formation of the ds-oligonucleotide assembly is detected electrochemically using differential pulse voltammetry. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

One approach that is used to decrease contamination of manufactured devices by microorganisms is using materials that easily slough off accumulated material (i.e., fouling release surfaces). The compounds currently used for this purpose rely on low surface energy to inhibit strong attachment of organisms. In this study, we examined the possible use of environmentally responsive (or ""smart"") polymers as a new class of fouling release agents; a surface-grafted thermally responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM), was used as a model compound. PNIPAAM is known to have a lower critical solubility temperature of similar to 32 degrees C (i.e., it is insoluble in water at temperatures above 32 degrees C acid is soluble at temperatures below 32 degrees C), Under experimental conditions, >90% of cultured microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Halomonas marina) and naturally occurring marine microorganisms that attached to grafted PNIPAAM surfaces during 2-, 18-, 36-, and 72-h incubations were removed when the hydration stale of the polymer was changed from a wettability that was favorable for attachment to a wettability that was less favorable, Of particular significance is the observation that an organism known to attach in the greatest numbers to hydrophobic substrata (i.e., H. marina) was removed when transition of PNIPAAM to a more hydrated state occurred, whereas an organism that attaches in the greatest numbers to hydrophilic substrata (i.e., S. epidermidis) was removed when the opposite transition occurred. Neither solvated nor desolvated PNIPAAM exhibited intrinsic fouling release properties, indicating that the phase transition was the important factor in removal of organisms. Based on our observations of the behavior of this model system, we suggest that environmentally responsive polymers represent a new approach for controlling biofouling release.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Chem & Nucl Engn, Farris Engn Ctr 209, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Lopez, GP (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Chem & Nucl Engn, Farris Engn Ctr 209, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",gplopez@unm.edu,"Ista, Linnea/A-5029-2016","Ista, Linnea/0000-0002-8747-9987",NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,34,119,120,0,30,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171 USA",0099-2240,,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

An adsorbed layer of calcium-phosphate was spontaneously formed on the titanium oxide surface and its thickness as well as the Ca/P ratio was found to increase with immersion time. After 71 days of immersion, the Ca/P ratio corresponded to that of brushite or monetite and after 6 months it was close to the value of hydroxyapatite. A higher Ca/P ratio was found for adsorption from solutions where the pH had been increased. After adsorption, the grains of the evaporated titanium substrate appeared slightly smoother because they were covered by a thin layer of calcium phosphate. A comparison between immersion in a Hanks' solution and solutions containing only phosphates or only calcium ions, showed that the presence of phosphates is necessary for the adsorption of Ca-ions.

The use of biomaterials in the form of microscope slides as walls in the chamber makes it possible to analyse both the biomaterial surface with regard to protein and cell binding, as well as the molecular events taking place in the fluid. Incubation of blood in the chamber, for 60 min at 37 degrees C resulted in the rapid binding of complement and coagulation proteins and of leukocytes and platelets to polyvinylchloride (PVC) slides. The cells formed a layer which more or less covered the underlying surface. Unlike complement activation, as reflected by soluble C3a and C5b-9, the thrombin-antithrombin formation was completely nullified in cell-depleted plasma Despite the fact that thrombin-antithrombin generation was also negligible in platelet-rich plasma, inhibition of platelet aggregation on the material surface with aspirin resulted in suppressed generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes. Taken together, the coagulation activation in the chamber was dependent on the presence of blood cells which suggests that bound/aggregated platelets initiate a sequence of events involving leukocytes that results in coagulation activation.

The consecutive increase of pores size as well as the use of multifilaments led to a pronounced increase of flexibility. To improve the handling during operation the initial stiffness of this low-weight large pores mesh was increased by strengthening with different amounts of absorbable polyglactin (combination of glycolide and lactide) in various forms: by coating (mesh B), adding multifilament polyglactin filaments (mesh C, Vypro(R)) or both (mesh D), respectively. To test the consequences of the different supplementary techniques all mesh Variants are implanted in a rat model. Over implantation intervals of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days we measured the tensile strength, the resulting stiffness and surveyed the tissue response, particularly in regard to the extent of inflammation and to the induced fibrosis. The results proved a sufficient mechanical stability of the material reduced and pure polypropylene mesh A without restriction of the mobility of the abdominal wall compared with a group that had simple laparotomy and closure. The histological analysis of the interface showed a minor inflammatory reaction and a dense vascularisation. The addition of polyglactin multifilaments (mesh C) reduces the number of macrophages and granulocytes as indicators for acute inflammation, showing generally a scar formation limited merely to the perifilamentary region. The abdominal wall compliance remained unchanged compared with mesh A. The coating of the polypropylene with polyglactin (mesh B and D) appeared to change the tissue reaction remarkably, favouring the formation of a connective tissue capsule around the whole mesh. The mechanical testing revealed an apparent protrusion with an increase of curvature of the artificial abdominal wall at rising intraabdominal pressures. The entire coating of the polypropylene surface with polyglactin induces an all embedding scar plate, filling out the pores and forming a tissue capsule. The complex interaction of tissue and implanted biomaterials with their distinct alterations of the tissue response confirms the necessity of in vivo experiments even after 'minor' modifications. Whereas the addition of polyglactin filaments appears to be favourable, the coating of polypropylene with polyglactin seems to hinder the incorporation of the mesh. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the control group, the defect was closed primarily. In the extraperitoneal group, polypropylene mesh was sutured over the abdominal wall after primary closure of the peritoneum and in the intraperitoneal group, polypropylene mesh was sutured to close the created defect so that it was in contact with the intestines. Main outcome measures: Bacterial translocation at 4, 24 and 48 hours. Results: Insertion of mesh in contact with the peritoneum led to increased bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes at 4 (p = 0.02) and 48 (p = 0.03) hours compared with insertion without contact.

We have previously shown that these materials activate neutrophils by contact, leading to production of oxygen free radicals accompanied by release of granule products. Such activation further results in depletion of local host defenses, including the capacity of biomaterial-activated neutrophils to kill bacteria. Among the granule products released from neutrophils are small cationic antibacterial peptides (human neutrophil peptides [HNP]) known as defensins. Here we tested the hypothesis that defensins, released from activated neutrophils onto the surface of biomaterials, might play a role in the deactivation of subsequent neutrophil populations. Incubation of neutrophils with purified HNP resulted in a dose-related impairment of stimulus-induced oxygen radical production and of phagocytic killing. Furthermore, fresh neutrophils added to biomaterial-associated neutrophils exhibited impaired phagocytic killing. This impairment could be abrogated by antibody to HNP but not by an irrelevant antibody Taken together, these observations support the idea that neutrophils activated at a material surface can create, by means of HNP release, an environment hostile to their microbicidal function and that of their infiltrating brethren.","Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Magee Womens Res Inst, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Kaplan, SS (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Room 5930 MT CHP,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM-41734],,,79,25,26,1,5,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171 USA",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

Internal pressure gradients arise from internal heating and vaporization and significantly enhance the transport. Even a moderate internal pressure gradient in a low moisture material can cause more moisture to move to the surface than can be removed from the surface, leading to a soggy surface. A strong internal pressure gradient in a high moisture material can fully saturate the surface, leading to a very high moisture loss by liquid outflow at the surface. Addition of hot air and/or infrared heating of the surface to increase evaporation is suggested as a way to reduce surface moisture build-up. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The structural, physicochemical and mechanical parameters of these two preparations were investigated, and two different macroporous BCP1 (MBCP1) and BCP2 (MBCP2) implants were manufactured and implanted in rabbit bone for in vivo bioactivity studies. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed that MBCP1 implants had a significantly higher degradation rate (P<0.0001) than MBCP2 implants. This was probably caused by the presence of calcium oxide impurities in BCP1 and the more intimate mixture and stable ultrastructure of BCP2. No significant difference about the newly formed bone rate in these two BCP preparations was observed. Very slight variations in sintering conditions appeared to influence the biodegradation behavior of the two MBCP implants despite their identical HA/beta-TCP ratios and similar porosity. Precise and complete in vitro characterization enabled us to understand and predict in vivo degradation behavior.

This experimental study evaluated the osteoconductive properties of an injectable bone substitute (IBS) composed of a polymeric carrier and a calcium phosphate mineral phase, used to fill mandibular and maxillary canine extraction sockets. Methods: The polymer was a cellulose derivative (methyl-hydroxy-propyl-cellulose, MHPC), and the mineral phase consisted of granules of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics 200 to 500 mu m in diameter, Mandibular and maxillary premolars extracted from 3 dogs (a total of 60 extraction sites) were immediately treated with the IBS or left unfilled as control sites. Animals were sacrificed 3 months after implantation and all extraction sockets were prepared for histological evaluation. Results: Qualitative histological studies showed that the IBS was able to support the extensive apposition of well-mineralized newly formed lamellar bone over the entire socket surface and appeared to prevent alveolar ridge bone loss in treated extraction sites. Quantitative evaluation showed that the amount of newly formed bone was significantly higher in mandibular than maxillary extraction sockets for both treated and control sites. Conclusions: An injectable bone substitute composed of a polymeric carrier and calcium phosphate was effective in enhancing the bone fill of extraction sockets. This approach may prove promising for periodontal lesions. The material expressed osteoconductive capacities, and the biological properties of the mineral phase were conserved.","Ecole Natl Vet, Lab Chirurg, F-44307 Nantes 3, France; Fac Chirurg Dent, Equipe INSERM, Lab Rech Mat Interet Biol, Nantes, France","Gauthier, O (reprint author), Ecole Natl Vet, Lab Chirurg, Route Gachet,BP 40706, F-44307 Nantes 3, France.",,"Gauthier, Olivier/A-4639-2015; Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014; Weiss, Pierre/P-1372-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446; Weiss, Pierre/0000-0002-6159-8590; BOULER, Jean-Michel/0000-0001-9784-5584",,,,44,72,80,0,12,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690 USA",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Depending on their overall composition, these compounds are endowed with heparin-like properties such as anticoagulant activity. Indeed, some CMDBS with high CIM and S contents delay blood coagulation, whilst some derivatized dextrans without significant anticoagulant capacity are potent antiproliferative agents for rat smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro as well as heparin. The growth inhibition is dose dependent, reversible and nontoxic. This result is of prime interest for medical use because proliferation of vascular SMCs is postulated to be a key step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis or restenosis after vascular surgery such as angioplasty. By varying the overall composition in the different substituents, we have also prepared CMDBS exhibiting a stimulatory effect on the in vitro growth of human endothelial cells (EC). Heparin, under similar experimental conditions, slightly inhibited EC growth. The data indicate a synergistic role of all substituents grafted onto the dextran backbone without considering that any can be responsible alone for this effect. We conclude that a suitable distribution of CM, B and S groups on dextran can mimic heparin activity in terms of anticoagulant activity and antiproliferative capacity on SMC growth. Moreover, some CMDBS are also endowed with a stimulatory effect on EC growth. These properties confer great interest to these synthetic polysaccharides for vascular therapy.

The degree of cross-linking was evaluated by assaying the released amount of hydroxyproline (Hyp) from the matrix, and comparing it with the positive controls of valves treated by glutaraldehyde (GA) solution (0.625 wt%) and the negative controls of non-treated fresh valves. The undigested weight ratio of the specimens increased Ly increasing the UV irradiation time. The undigested weight of the leaflets, tunica interna and tunica externa of the fresh, GA-treated and UV-irradiated specimens after collagenase digestion was compared. As UV irradiation increased, the amount of released hydroxyproline was gradually decreased until 8 hours of irradiation, alter which the released hydroxyproline-reduction occurred slightly until 24 hours of irradiation time in this system. A total 47.68% of the hydroxyproline in the valve was cross-linked by UV irradiation after 24 hours, while 73.74% of the hydroxyproline in the positive control was crossed-linked. Light microscopic observation revealed that the typical crimp pattern of collagen fibers decreased and was rearranged into a dense flattened pattern as the UV irradiation induced interfibrilar cross-linking. GA-treated valves demonstrated a denser matrix pattern than the UV-irradiated specimens. Cross-linked collagenous tissue prepared by UV irradiation would be useful for improving durability and reducing the disadvantages related to using a chemical cross-linking agent.","Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, Seoul 120752, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, Seoul 120752, South Korea","Suh, H (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",hwal@yumc.yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,36,11,11,0,1,YONSEI UNIV COLL MEDICINE,SEOUL,"50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,1976-2437,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

They are generally associated with clinical infections predominantly of prothetic hip joints, heart valves and catheters. Sessile microorganisms may be intimately associated with each other and to solid substratum through binding to and inclusion into exopolymer matrices an biofilms. The establishment of functional colonies within the exopolymeric matrices generate physico-chemical gradients within biofilms, that modify the metabolism and cell-wall properties of the microorganism. A consequence of biofilm growth is enhanced microbial resistance to chemical antimicrobial agents and antibiotics. Investigations on the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics, antiseptics and antimicrobial heavy ions, however, gave controversial results. No single antimicrobial substance has been developed for the efficient eradication of adherent bacteria. This review elucidates the mechanisms of microbial resistance in biofilms and strategies for the prevention of biofilm development. Pharmacokinetical and pharmacodynamical issues for the screening of biofilm-active drugs are presented. Combinations of antistaphylococcal antibiotics with rifampin may be advantageous for preventing and curing biomaterial infections.","Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Clin Orthoped, Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Clin Prothet Dent, D-50935 Cologne, Germany","Schierholz, JM (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, Goldenfelsstr 19-21, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",,,,,,,60,28,30,1,3,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0934-8840,,,ZBL BAKT-INT J MED M,Zent.bl.

At the air-water interface, the nominal equilibrium spreading area of copolymers that have the same PPO content, or ""core"", increases with increasing PEO content by an amount equivalent to the area of the hydrated ethylene ether subunits. With compression, a PEG-dependent transition from an expanded to a more condensed monolayer occurs at similar to 10 dyn.cm(-1), presumably because of condensation of PEO segments onto the core and out of the plane of the surface. Consistent with these results and interpretation, the thickness of adsorbed films of copolymers from series that have fixed cores increases approximately linearly with ethylene oxide content. At collapse of copolymer films, the nominal area per molecule-regardless of the number of ether functions in the PEO segment-is that of the hydrated PPO core. On the basis of these data, we propose models for the structure and ordering of triblock copolymers in condensed films, and we relate these models to the gradation in protein resistance observed for such films.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA","Retzinger, GS (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",,"Gehrke, Stevin/A-5265-2014",,,,,42,29,29,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAR 30,1999.0,15,7,,,,,2580,2585,,10.1021/la9811113,,,,6,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,183EL,WOS:000079541000050,,,,,2019-02-25

Such tissue engineering requires application of biomaterials that selectively control the attachment, morphology, and proliferation of muscle progenitor (""satellite"") cells. This study examined the initial attachment, morphological characteristics, and proliferative behavior of murine C2C12 myoblasts on glass substrata derivatized with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the organosiloxanes N-(2-aminoethyl)(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (EDA) and tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-dimethylchlorosilane (13F). The fraction of myoblasts resisting detachment upon rinsing was greater on EDA than on 13F. Application of a quantitative moments-based analysis of cell morphology demonstrated that projected area and two size-invariant metrics of shape (extension and dispersion) for these cells were greater for EDA than for 13F. Myoblasts also proliferated faster on EDA than on 13F. These data indicate that EDA-derivatized glass provides a superior substratum for myoblast culture compared to 13F-derivatized glass. Understanding myoblast behavior on these biomaterials that promotes contrasting cellular responses is the first step toward using patterned SAMs to control myotube alignment for tissue engineering skeletal muscle.

The exudate formed inside cylindrical tubes subcutaneously implanted in the dorsal region of rats was collected over a 1-week period. A rapid and simple staining procedure based on the spectral properties of the bisbenzemide Hoechst 33342 was used to identify apoptotic PMN cells. Quantification of permeabilized PMN cells stained by propidium iodide was possible in the same unfixed specimens. The percentages of apoptotic and permeabilized PMN cells in peripheral rat blood were low (1.8 +/- 0.5% and 1.7 +/- 0.7%, respectively), similar to results found in humans. In exudates generated by polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the percentages of apoptotic and permeabilized PMN cells were higher than in the blood. The percentage of PMN cells undergoing apoptosis progressively increased with time and reached a maximum at day 2 (27% +/- 6%). The percentage of permeabilized cells progressively increased with time and was much higher than the percentage of apoptotic cells on days 4 and 8. Apoptosis and necrosis of PMN cells at day 2 were inhibited when tubes were filled with 10% serum. Selective inhibition of apoptosis with a caspase inhibitor in vivo indicated that apoptosis and necrosis are two separate pathways leading to the death of PMN cells in the exudate. At day 2, polyurethane (PU) was associated with a lower rate of apoptosis than PVC or a random copolymer of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and epsilon caprolactone (ECL). Apoptosis was interpreted as an organized cell removal process that limits inflammation. Apoptosis was the natural route of PMN cell death at the early stage of inflammation.

These polymers consist of a core-shell structure that resembles conventional micellar structures but with significant thermodynamic stability in aqueous media. The core of the polymers provide a hydrophobic environment for drug encapsulation via hydrophobic interactions, whereas the shell provides excellent water solubility. The polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and mass spectroscopies, as well as gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric and elemental analyses. Encapsulation ability was measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography to monitor Lidocaine, a hydrophobic molecule. Encapsulation capabilities increased as lipophilicity of the core increased. To verify that encapsulation was caused by individual unimolecular micelles, surface tension and dynamic light scattering measurements were performed. The results indicated that these unimolecular micelles have great potential as drug carriers.

Several studies suggest, however, that the conformation or orientation of immobilized fibrinogen rather than the total amount adsorbed plays an important role in determining the blood compatibility of biomaterials. The purpose of this study was to investigate time-dependent functional changes in fibrinogen adsorbed to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene (PE), and silicone rubber (SR). Fibrinogen was adsorbed to these materials for 1 min and then allowed to ""reside"" on the surfaces for up to 2 h prior to assessing its biological activity. Changes in fibrinogen reactivity were determined by measuring the adhesion of Cr-51-labeled platelets, the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against an important functional region of the fibrinogen molecule (the gamma-chain dodecapeptide sequence 400-411), and the ability of blood plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion differed among the polymeric materials studied, and PTFE and PE samples exhibited a small decrease in adhesion with increasing fibrinogen residence time. Platelet adhesion to SR was the least among all materials studied and showed no variation with residence time. When using PTFE and SR as substrates, mAb recognition of adsorbed fibrinogen did not change with residence time whereas that on PE decreased slightly. The mAb binding was least to fibrinogen adsorbed to SR, which is in agreement with the platelet adhesion results. Finally, the ability of plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen decreased dramatically with increasing residence time on all materials. These in vitro studies support the hypothesis that fibrinogen undergoes biologically significant conformational changes upon adsorption to polymeric biomaterials, a phenomenon that may contribute to the hemocompatibility of the materials following implantation in the body.

Segments of different types of suture with adherent bacteria were implanted subcutaneously into mice. The infection risk with Staphylococcus aureus was greater than with Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A or Candida albicans. The infection risk with the implantation of multifilament sutures was significantly greater than with monofilament sutures. When <10 colony forming units (cfu) of S. aureus were present on monofilament suture material, the infection rate was 3%. When <10 cfu of S. aureus were present on multifilament suture material, the infection rate was 7%. An infection rate of 15% occurred with <10 cfu of S. aureus on multifilament nylon sutures. When >10 but <20 cfu of S. aureus were present, the infection rates were 4 and 51%, respectively. These data confirm that the infection rate with multifilament sutures (or porous materials) is greater than with monofilament sutures (or solid materials) when the organisms are encountered at implantation (acute model) and indicate that a significant risk of infection may occur when only a few organisms are on a device at implantation.

We had hypothesized that material-induced neutrophil activation was an important parameter associated with material failure. All materials tested [cellophane, an acrylonitrile copolymer (AN69), Pellethane(TM) nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, low density polyethylene, and polydimethylsiloxane] activated isolated human neutrophils, which were resuspended in plasma or serum, to similar extents based on L-selectin shedding, CD11b upregulation, and stimulation of the oxidative burst after 30-min exposure. Inhibition of complement activation by sCR1 unexpectedly had Little effect if any on nonadherent neutrophils. However, neutrophil adhesion, but not the level of activation of the adherent cells, was strongly dependent on complement activation. Pretreatment with albumin did not inhibit adhesion or reduce neutrophil activation, but plasma pretreatment resulted in increased activation for nonadherent and adherent cells. More adhesion and a higher level of activation of adherent cells was observed following pretreatment with fibrinogen, a ligand of CD11b. Taken together these results suggest that upon contact with a material, neutrophil activation may occur though mechanisms that are not mediated by complement. For example, the presence of plasma proteins such as fibrinogen at the interface may trigger activation and the release of other activating agents. Although the material differences are small, the extent of activation may be significant and warrant further study of the mechanism and consequences of that activation.

In a recent study we found impaired fibronectin receptor function on hydrophobic substrata (G. Altankov et al. J Biomater Sci Polym Edn 1997;8:712-740). Here, we have studied the distribution and function of the vitronectin receptor (alpha(v) integrin) in fibroblasts adhering on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyl glass (ODS). The morphology of fibroblasts and the organization of actin cytoskeleton were studied and found to be altered on ODS, where the cells did not spread and possessed condensed actin. Pretreatment of the surfaces with serum or pure vitronectin improved cell morphology on both substrata, resulting in the development of longitudinal actin stress fibers. It was found with biotinylated vitronectin that comparable quantities of vitronectin were adsorbed from single vitronectin solutions or serum on glass and on hydrophobic ODS. The organization of the vitronectin receptors on the ventral cell surface was investigated in permeabilized cells showing normal focal adhesions in fibroblasts plated on glass but none of these structures on ODS. The distribution of alpha(v) integrin on the dorsal cell surface was studied on nonpermeabilized living cells after antibody tagging. While fibroblasts adhering on plain or serum-treated glass developed a Linear organization of alpha(v) integrin, cells on plain and serum-treated ODS were not able to reorganize the vitronectin receptor. Studies on signal transduction with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed co-localization of alpha(v) integrin and phosphotyrosine in focal adhesions on glass and serum-treated glass. However, signaling was almost absent on plain ODS and weak on serum-treated ODS. It was concluded that alterations in vitronectin receptor function on the ventral cell surface caused by the hydrophobic material surface inhibit signal transfer and subsequent intracellular events that are important for the organization and function of integrins.

To decrease the complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass, novel biomaterials have been introduced that may be less thrombogenic than standard synthetic surfaces. Methods. Thirty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to bypass using either a control circuit or a circuit prepared ""tip-to-tip"" with a triblock-copolymer (polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone). Results. There was a progressive increase in thrombin generation in the control group during bypass, which was not seen in the test group. The test surface decreased the release of tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complex formation (p < 0.005). There was also an increased platelet count and a decreased platelet activation in the test group, as detected by GMP-140 expression and beta-thromboglobulin release (p = 0.017). There was also significantly more debris that accumulated on the arterial filter in the control group, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Conclusions. This clinical trial has demonstrated a significant difference in the hematologic effects of the test circuits, with evidence of platelet preservation, decreased fibrinolysis, and decreased thrombin generation. A larger trial would be necessary to establish the clinical relevance of these differences.

Factors that govern bone cell, ie osteoblast, adhesion and ECM elaboration significantly influence its re-modeling into mature bone, and ultimately its ability to integrate with biomaterials used for orthopedic prostheses. Ln this study we have investigated how treatment with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that promotes ectopic bone formation, modulates the organization and expression of osteoblastic cell proteins. Specifically, we analyzed how BMP-2 treatment affects cytoskeletal components, ECM, and alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin receptor subunits in osteoblastic cells plated on Ti6Al4V, a titanium alloy widely used for orthopedic implants that interacts with bone cells in vitro and in vivo. Osteoblastic cells were pre-treated with BMP-2 for 12 h prior to plating; BMP-2 treatment stimulated adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells and this adhesive advantage was reflected in enhanced long-term matrix mineralization in the BMP-2 pretreated cultures. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis of BMP-2 treated cells showed that enhanced cytoskeletal organization and focal contact formation occurred. These changes were accompanied by a concomitant increase in the spatial organization of fibronectin, whereas vitronectin, collagen type I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin showed little change. The changes in ECM organization correlated with increased fibronectin, alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin subunit, and focal adhesion kinase (p125(FAK)) expression, as well as increased p125(FAK) phosphorylation. By confocal microscopy, the alpha 5 integrin subunit was more concentrated in lamellipodia after BMP-2 treatment. These results demonstrate that BMP-2 significantly altered osteoblastic cytoskeletal and ECM organization and enhanced expression of fibronectin and of specific integrin receptor subunits, with concomitant changes in the levels and phosphorylation of p125(FAK). These effects may contribute to downstream cellular responses important for bone cell function, and growth.

A water uptake ability test, in vitro drug release and collagenase degradation tests, and an in vivo animal test were employed to confirm the applicability of this gelatin-alginate sponge as a wound dressing material. As the alginate content in the sponge increased, the porosity increased, resulting in an enhanced water uptake ability. Sponges loaded with silver sulfadiazine or gentamicin sulfate slowly released drugs for up to four days. The crosslinked sponge resisted in vitro collagenase digestion for up to three days.

The present study was aimed at reconstruction of abdominal wall muscle using processed dermal sheep collagen (DSC) and myoblast seeding. Myoblasts were harvested from foetal quadriceps muscle of an inbred rat strain, cultured, seeded as non-differentiated cells into DSC-discs and incubated in vitro for 2 h. The discs were implanted in the abdominal wall defects in adult rats. Non-seeded discs functioned as control. Implantation periods till week 6 were chosen. At day 1 and 2 after implantation infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages was clearly more intense in the seeded discs than in the controls. Relatively large numbers of mast cells infiltrated from the side of the adhering omentum. In central areas of the discs, seeded cells were easily recognized till day 5, since non-seeded control discs did not contain such cells. Ingrowth of host cells and tissue at the margins proceeded faster with the seeded discs. Lymphocyte accumulations were observed in the 3 week seeded specimen. At week 3 and week 6, in the seeded discs muscle tissue was not present, in contrast to very large giant-like cells. It is concluded that the chosen method of myoblast seeding did not result in the regeneration of muscle during this observation period. Unfavorable circumstances such as humoral factors, direct cellular interactions (phagocytosis), indirect cellular interactions (cytokines), or initial absence of vascularization, may play a role. Further studies are required. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aim of this work was to study the in vitro toxicity of solutions of these radio-opacifiers using two cell culture models. Primary-cultures of human urothelial cells (HUC) arising from normal adult urinary tract and permanent urothelial cell line were used. Solutions at different dilutions were placed into the wells containing monolayers of confluent cells. After 24 h incubation period, the solutions were removed and cell viability and cell metabolic activity tests were performed (Neutral Red assay and MTT assay). At a concentration lower than 1 mg 1(-1) the different radio-opacifiers used showed no toxicity. From 1 to 3 mg 1(-1) one can note a significant dose-dependent decrease of cell metabolic activity of solely HUC for barium chloride. At 3 mg 1(-1) one can note a significant deleterious effect on HUC metabolic activity, with bismuth and tantale. For tungsten, there is no deleterious effect, but on the contrary a significant increase in HUC metabolic activity at a 0.5 mg 1(-1) concentration. None of the solutions did provoke alterations in HUC viability for concentrations less than 3 mg 1(-1). Interestingly, for permanent cell line one can note a solely significant decrease of cell viability at 3 mg 1(-1) for tantale. All the other tested salts on permanent cell line were not significantly different from controls for cell viability as well as cell metabolic activity. HUC culture model may be of relevance for the screening of radio-opacifiers intended for ureteral endoprostheses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A number of cross-linking methods have been tested in biological tissues composed mainly of collagen. The basis for most of them is the use of glutaraldehyde (GA), which acts on the Lys or Hyl residues. We have studied the effects of alternative chemical treatments: diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) and ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDAC). Their mechanism of action is based on the activation of the carboxyl groups, which then permits their cross-linking to amino groups. As a control, we employed conventional treatment with GA, applying it to bovine pericardium and collagen membranes removed from bovine pericardium. The analysis of the Lys and Hyl residues showed that DPPA and EDAC produced 50% of the chemical change provoked by GA. This value was even lower in the trials with collagen. In terms of the resistance to collagenase degradation, chemical cross-linking with GA provided much greater protection in both materials (3.81 +/- 3.47 nmol of amino acid/mg dry tissue for pericardium and 4.41 +/- 1.13 nmol of amino acid/mg dry tissue for collagen). Treatment with DPPA also protected pericardium (13.11 +/- 6.57 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue) although the values for collagen was lower (50.0 +/- 32.4 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue).Treatment with EDAC was much less protective than the other two chemical reagents (43.28 +/- 17.4 and 55.85 +/- 14.57 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue for pericardium and collagen, respectively). The degree of tissue calcification after implantation of the chemically treated materials into young rats was considerably greater for GA and DPPA (32.9 +/- 18.8 and 36.3 +/- 13.3 mg g(-1) dry tissue, respectively) than with EDAC (18.0 +/- 7.2 mg g(-1) dry tissue; P < 0.001). After 60 days of implantation, the values for GA and EDAC were higher (124.1 +/- 31.3 and 124.6 +/- 21.0 mg g(-1) dry tissue, respectively) versus 34.6 +/- 19.2 mg g(-1) dry tissue for DPPA. There were no significant differences in collagen levels in samples treated with GA or EDAC after 30 days of implantation, although both groups showed significant differences when compared with DPPA-treated samples (P < 0.001). After 60 days of implantation, there were no significant differences among these three treatments in terms of the calcium accumulated on samples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is well established that after implantation that proteins will be adsorbed on to the surface of biomaterials and may then influence the development of surface mineralised layers. Hydroxyapatite was synthesised by wet method and electrophoretically deposited over 316L stainless steel at optimised coating parameters. The corrosion behaviour of the coated materials was evaluated under physiological conditions using 0.9% saline solution with addition of 10% bovine serum by cyclic polarisation studies.

The polymers coated are silicone and polyethylene, and the effect on the friction coefficient is studied. Film adhesion is found to depend on the DLC film refractive index (n), whereas the friction is largely independent of kn in the range studied. Films were deposited from a He/C2H2 mixture at 20 Pa (0.15 Torr) on to the polymer substrates placed on a 10-cm-diameter electrode driven at 13.56 MHz. Film growth was monitored by in-situ ellipsometry (at 675 nm), which was performed on a glass slide placed near the polymer substrate. Friction measurements were obtained using a pin-on-disk tribometer, and measurements were carried out using a stainless-steel pin at a linear speed of 6 cm s(-1) Film adhesion was evaluated using a pull-adhesion tester. It was found that DLC coatings adhere well to the polymer substrates and can significantly reduce the friction coefficient of polymers such as silicone. Higher refractive index films (which are harder and have a higher mechanical strength) were found to have a poorer adhesion and provide a slightly increased friction on the polymer surface when compared to lower-index films. This study indicates that DLC may be used to enhance the tribological properties of polymers with potential applications in the biomaterials and light-engineering industries.

Since the nature of bone cell responses in vitro is influenced by the properties of HA ceramics, this study was divided into 2 components: a chemical and crystallographic characterization of the HA ceramics, and an in vitro cell culture study. Sintered HA samples were observed to have the highest crystallite size, compared to as-received HA and calcined HA samples. No differences in surface roughness and chemical composition were observed between the sintered, calcined, and as-received HA surfaces. In concurrence with the x-ray diffraction, high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Ca 2p also indicated a higher crystallinity on sintered HA samples compared to calcined and as-received HA samples. Protein production by osteoblast cells was not statistically different on the 3 HA surfaces in the absence of TGF-beta. However, there was a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta-stimulated protein produc tion on the 3 different HA surfaces. As indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, as well as 1,25 (OH2) vitamin D-3-stimulated osteocalcin production, a more differentiated osteoblastlike phenotype was observed on the sintered HA surfaces compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA surfaces. An increased osteoblast-like cell activity on sintered HA surfaces in the presence of different TGF-beta dosage suggested that sintering of HA surfaces may play an important role in governing cellular response.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Biomat, Dept Restorat Mat, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Endodont, San Antonio, TX USA; CeraMed Corp, Lakewood, CO USA","Ong, JL (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Biomat, Dept Restorat Mat, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA.",,,,,,,45,15,17,0,3,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Male rabbits were used, Blood was collected from the marginal vein of the ear 2 times per subject: the first sample was used as the baseline; 1 week later, the second was preceded in half of the subjects by 20 min of immobilization stress. In vitro adhesion of platelets on the PE was evaluated. The exposure of animals to stress induced a dramatic change in platelet morphology and functions on the PE: a higher degree of platelet adhesion, increased platelet spreading, and the appearance of pseudopodia, In the unstressed subjects there were no modifications of the platelets on the PE with respect to the baseline. The present experiment emphasizes for the first time the possible problems involved with the varying physiological conditions of patients before and after any biomaterial application surgery and of subjects who supply the blood for hemocompatibility tests performed on biomaterials. Therefore, in assessments of the performance of different biomaterials, the reactivity of blood factors in the patients should be considered and the test of blood compatibility should be performed with blood collected from donors in appropriate physiological conditions, (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Univ Siena, Dept Chem & Biosyst Sci & Technol, I-53100 Siena, Italy; Univ Siena, Ist Fisiol Umana, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Barbucci, R (reprint author), Univ Siena, Dept Chem & Biosyst Sci & Technol, Pian dei Mantellini 44, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",,"Aloisi, Anna Maria/E-7183-2013",,,,,10,8,8,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

However, there is a possibility that these materials are responsible for an unwanted inflammatory response during wound healing. Since TCP is soluble in the body, the instability of this material may contribute to this inflammatory response. Using composite ceramics of TCP and HAP that possessed Ca/P molar ratios of 1.50, 1.55, 1.60, 1.64, and 1.67, the effect of surface instability on fibroblast L-929 cells was investigated. The time-dependent variation of the initial anchoring ratio, cell density, and cell viability were measured. In general, the cells were severely damaged and ruptured on the highly soluble thin surface layer of the TCP-HAP ceramics. The initial anchoring ratio for TCP-HAP ceramics was as high as that for the polystyrene dish (Lux, control). However, viability at 6 h decreased to less than 50% of the initial cell density on ceramics with a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.64 (20% TCP-80% MAP), while 85% of the cells were viable on Lux. The viability on 100% TCP, whose surface is the most highly soluble among the TCP-HAP ceramics used in this study, was reduced to 20%. Morphological observation showed that the anchored cells were ruptured when grown in culture medium on the 100% TCP. Although the high solubility of the thin surface layer on the TCP-HAP ceramics of the carrier was found to be the dominant factor in the decreasing cell viability, the initial viability was enhanced by the stabilization of the surface of the TCP-HAP ceramics by pre-incubating the scaffolds in a culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 d.","Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Chiba 2788510, Japan; Natl Ind Res Inst Nagoya, Bioceram Lab, Nagoya 4628510, Japan","Suzuki, T (reprint author), Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, 2641 Yamazaki, Chiba 2788510, Japan.",,"nagata, fukue/M-8449-2018; Nishizawa, Kaori/F-8655-2011","nagata, fukue/0000-0002-5284-9626; Nishizawa, Kaori/0000-0002-3143-1298",,,,41,30,30,0,2,SOC BIOSCIENCE BIOENGINEERING JAPAN,OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA, 565-0871, JAPAN",1389-1723,,,J BIOSCI BIOENG,J.

It describes how death, ageing, degeneration, pathology and individual variability influence the properties of natural tissues. Experimental problems arise from degradation and testing conditions; these are illustrated by the properties of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. Replacement of natural tissues by graft materials and the products of tissue engineering is then described. Synthetic replacement materials should be biocompatible, i.e. they should not cause adverse reactions in the human body. However, polymers which hydrolyse in the body fluids may be useful for implants which are intended to have a limited life or for controlled release of drugs. Synthetic implant materials may attempt to mimic natural tissues but there may be a problem of attaching them to the surrounding tissue, Artificial ligaments provide an example of implants of this kind. Total hip replacement is used to illustrate the successful use of conventional engineering materials, Finally, safety issues are described; an implant material must be biocompatible, have the required mechanical strength, be sterile and should be incorporated into a device so that its performance in the living patient can be monitored.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Aberdeen, Scotland","Hukins, DWL (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Aberdeen, Scotland.",d.hukins@biomed.abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,46,36,36,1,12,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0959-9428,1364-5501,,J MATER CHEM,J.

This in vivo implantation technique is used to test new materials as putative delivery vehicles in skeletal tissue-engineering models. HYAFF 11 and ACP sponges, two biomaterials based on hyaluronic acid modified by esterification of the carboxyl groups of the glucuronic acid, were tested as osteogenic or chondrogenic delivery vehicles for rabbit mesenchymal progenitor cells and compared with a well characterized porous calcium phosphate ceramic delivery vehicle. The implant materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy for differences in pore structure or cellular interactions, were quantified for their ability to bind and retain mesenchymal progenitor cells, and were examined histologically for their ability to support osteogene sis and chondrogenesis after subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. The ACP sponge bound the same number of cells as fibronectin-coated ceramic, whereas the HYAFF 11 sponge bound 90% more. When coated with fibronectin, ACP and HYAFF 11 bound, respectively, 100 and 130% more cells than the coated ceramics. HYAFF 11 sponge composites retained their integrity after the 3 or B-week incubation period in the animals and were processed for histomorphometric analysis. As a result of rapid degradation or resorption in vivo, ACP sponges could not be recovered after implantation and could not be analyzed. HYAFF 11 sponges presented more area available for cell attachment and more available volume for newly formed tissue. Following loading with mesenchymal progenitor cells and implantation, the pores of the sponges contained more bone and cartilage than the pores of ceramic cubes at either time point. Thus, relative to ceramic, HYAFF 11 sponges allow incorporation of twice as many cells and produce a 30% increase in the relative amount of bone and cartilage per unit area. Hence, the hyaluronic acid-based delivery vehicles are superior to porous calcium phosphate ceramic with respect to the number of cells loaded per unit volume of implant, and HYAFF 11 sponges are superior to the ceramics with regard to the amount of bone and cartilage formed. Additionally, hyaluronic acid-based vehicles have the advantage of degradation/resorption characteristics that allow complete replacement of the implant with newly formed tissue.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Caplan, AI (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, 2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,"Sano, Michael/E-1715-2011","Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,35,298,310,2,65,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Three kinds of surface conditions of amorphous alloys were prepared: as-received (by single roller melt spinning method), polished and just-polished (within 300 s after polishing). Polished crystalline alloys were also polarized as controls. I-corr (corrosion current density) and I-crit (critical passive current density) of the as-received amorphous alloys and the polished crystalline alloys decreased with increasing chromium content. Corrosion resistance of these alloys was improved by the addition of chromium. I-corr, I-crit and I-ps (passivation current density) of the polished amorphous alloys were lower than those of the polished crystalline alloys and these values of the former alloys were independent of chromium content. This indicates that corrosion resistance of the polished amorphous alloys is higher in the artificial body fluid than that of the polished crystalline alloys. To determine the cathodic reactant on the as-received amorphous alloys in deaerated PBS(-), one of the alloys was polarized in deaerated 2.5 kmol%H2SO4. The cathodic Tafel slope in PBS(-) was the same as that in H2SO4, indicating that the cathodic reactant in PBS(-) was identified as hydrogen ion. Ln addition, polarization curves of pure palladium, pure copper and pure chromium were examined to determine the anodic reaction. E-corr (corrosion potential) of the pure palladium was similar to those of the alloys, suggesting that palladium ion is preferentially released from the alloys under the immersion in deaerated PBS(-). I-corr, and I-crit of the polished amorphous alloys were lower than those of the as-received amorphous alloys. To discuss the improvement in corrosion resistance by polishing, just-polished alloys were also polarized. The curves of the as-received and the just-polished alloys contained negative loop except the polished alloys. I-corr and I-crit of the just-polished alloys were slightly larger than those of the polished alloys. These results indicate that the surface morphology of the amorphous alloys changed during the exposure to air, causing the increase in corrosion resistance.","Natl Res Inst Met, Sci & Technol Agcy, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hiromoto, S (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Met, Sci & Technol Agcy, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"BAI, JIE/D-7448-2016; HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011",,,,,9,9,9,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",0021-4876,1880-6880,,J JPN I MET,J.

A single wheat grain with a known amount of moisture was placed on the MRR at two different orientations (0 degrees and 90 degrees) with respect to the feedline. The resonance frequency (f(r)), bandwidth (B) and quality factor (Q(r)) of the MRR were calibrated against the moisture content. The measurements were made with a scalar network analyser. The sensor was studied in the normal useful moisture range of 11-32% (on a wet-weight basis), the actual moisture values being obtained by an oven-drying method. The 0 degrees orientation was more sensitive to moisture than was the 90 degrees orientation. The total changes in f(r) for a 21% change in moisture content for 0 degrees and 90 degrees orientations were 235 and 150 MHz, respectively. The errors in moisture estimation with f(r) for 0 degrees and 90 degrees were +/-2.06% and +/-2.09%, respectively. The corresponding values with B and Q(r) for 90 degrees orientation were +/-2.14% and +/-2.19%, respectively. The proposed sensor is more sensitive than a reported waveguide resonator and is easy to operate, for the microstrip offers an open structure, thereby facilitating easy loading and unloading of the samples.","Univ Pune, Dept Phys, RCMF Transducer Lab, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Abegaonkar, MP (reprint author), Univ Pune, Dept Phys, RCMF Transducer Lab, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",rca@physics.unipune.ernet.in,,,,,,18,27,29,0,7,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0957-0233,1361-6501,,MEAS SCI TECHNOL,Meas.

The goal of the reported studies was to investigate the effect of fluid flow on the morphology, phagocytic function and stress response induction in adherent immune cells. Shear approximating arterial, venous and intermediate levels were applied onto glass-adherent IC21 macrophages in a temperature-controlled parallel plate flow system. The results indicate that fluid flow induces a shear-dependent physiological stress response in adherent macrophages and that significant morphological changes accompany macrophage responses to shear stress. In addition, arterial flow conditions induce not only significant cell polarisation, but also enhanced phagocytic ingestion in glass-adherent IC21 macrophages. These findings suggest that blood flow induced shear stress may not only be consequent to adherent leukocyte activation, but may also be integral to the regulation of adherent leukocyte behaviour in vivo.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Moghe, PV (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",,,,,,,45,7,7,0,5,PETER PEREGRINUS LTD,HERTS,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE, SIX HILLS WAY, STEVANAGE, HERTS SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",0140-0118,,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

Bubble collapse in liquids results in an enormous concentration of energy from the conversion of the kinetic energy of liquid motion into heating of the contents of the bubble. The high local temperatures and pressures, combined with extraordinarily rapid cooling, provide a unique means for driving chemical reactions under extreme conditions. A diverse set of applications of ultrasound to enhance chemical reactivity has been explored, with important applications in mixed-phase synthesis, materials chemistry, and biomedical uses. For example, the sonochemical decomposition of volatile organometallic precursors in low-volatility solvents produces nanostructured materials in various forms with high catalytic activities. Nanostructured metals, alloys, carbides and sulphides, nanometre colloids, and nanostructured supported catalysts can all be prepared by this general route. Another important application of sonochemistry to materials chemistry has been the preparation of biomaterials, most notably protein microspheres. Such microspheres have a wide range of biomedical applications, including their use as echo contrast agents for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, and oxygen or drug delivery.","Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,"Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011; Hyeon, Taeghwan/J-5315-2012","Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701; Lee, Junyoung/0000-0001-6689-2759",,,,64,402,406,3,88,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Most of these responsive hydrogels are prepared from a limited number of synthetic polymers and their derivatives, such as copolymers of (meth)acrylic acid, acrylamide and N-isopropyl acrylamide(3-12). Water-soluble synthetic polymers have also been crosslinked with molecules of biological origin, such as oligopeptides(13) and oligodeoxyribonudeotides(14), or with intact native proteins(15). Very often there are several factors influencing the relationship between structure and properties in these systems, making it difficult to engineer hydrogels with specified responses to particular stimuli. Here we report a hybrid hydrogel system assembled from water-soluble synthetic polymers and a well-defined protein-folding motif, the coiled coil. These hydrogels undergo temperature-induced collapse owing to the cooperative conformational transition of the coiled-coil protein domain. This system shows that well-characterized water-soluble synthetic polymers can be combined with well-defined folding motifs of proteins in hydrogels with engineered volume-change properties(16,17).","Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmaceut Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Kopecek, J (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",Jindrich.Kopecek@m.cc.utah.edu,,,,,,30,442,449,11,204,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,FEB 4,1999.0,397,6718,,,,,417,420,,10.1038/17092,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,164KA,WOS:000078461700042,9989405.0,,,,2019-02-25

A major objective of the workshop was to examine the emerging connections between macromolecular science and other areas of science and engineering, and identify exciting areas of opportunity in this context for the next decade. A second objective was to consider what approaches NSF could use to optimize, through research and education, the development of interdisciplinary MMSE. In the fall of 1996 Andrew Lovinger approached Prof. S.I. Stupp to chair the workshop and form an organizing committee. The first step was to solicit opinions from the community at. large on what directions were perceived to be important and exciting. Based on input from the community, five discussion groups for the workshop covering the following themes: novel macromolecular structures : synthesis and function; control of properties through innovative processing; solving environmental problems with macromolecular science and engineering; macromolecular science connections between the physical and biological sciences; and translating macromolecular discoveries into technologies. The selection of these particular topics for the workshop was nor meant to exclude the vast number of other areas in macromolecular science and engineering that are scientifically and technically important. The topics of the workshop were selected because they were identified as exciting areas of opportunity with a high interdisciplinary content. The content of recommendations made by each discussion group varies; some emphasized research directions and others educational issues or funding procedures. These differences reflect the nature of each topic and also the specific concerns of individuals in the discussion group.","Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SOC FRANCAISE CHIMIE,PARIS,"250 RUE SAINT-JACQUES, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE",0151-9093,,,ACTUAL CHIMIQUE,Actual Chim.,FEB,1999.0,,2,,,,,3,5,,,,,,3,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,176WK,WOS:000079174900002,,,,,2019-02-25

Methods: Similar-sized endplates made of 3 different biomaterials were sutured to the sclera in the superotemporal quadrant of the rabbit eye. Thirty eyes of 15 albino New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to the 3 groups. Conjunctival vascular hyperemia was graded in a masked fashion among groups. At the end of 3 weeks, the enucleated eyes were examined histologically and using scanning electron microscopy. Results: Polypropylene and Vivathane were associated with significantly more inflammation in clinical observations and based on histological grading. Silicone was associated with the least amount of inflammation. Three polypropylene and 1 Vivathane plate were extruded between the second and third week. Conclusions: Silicone is the most inert of the 3 materials tested. Inflammation associated with biomaterials may contribute to the failure of the glaucoma drainage devices. Clinical Relevance: Bleb inflammation may be related to the biomaterial being used as the endplate.

Subcutaneous sites lack adequate vascularization to nutritionally support transplanted hepatocytes. We recently reported that matrix-immobilized angiogenic growth factors, e.g., endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), can induce a high degree of neovascularization. Using this technique, we explored the possibility of transplanting isolated fetal porcine hepatocytes to create liver tissue organoids at a specific subcutaneous site. We evaluated chitosan as a scaffold biomaterial because of its structural similarity to glycosaminoglycans; glycosaminoglycans play a critical role in cell attachment, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Freshly isolated fetal porcine hepatocytes (FPH) (viability greater than 97%) were cultured on modified chitosan scaffolds and transplanted into rat groin fat pads with or without ECGF-induced neovascularization. Cell density and attachment kinetics on chitosan were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified using a flavianic acid binding assay. Hepatocyte viability and liver organoid formation were examined immunohistochemically. FPH transplanted without prior neovascularization died within 1 day posttransplantation. When transplanted after ECGF-induced neovascularization, FPH thrived for at least 2 weeks and formed liver tissue like structures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of hepatocyte-specific cytokeratin staining as well as the presence of alpha-fetoprotein. Light microscopy and SEM revealed that FPH did not change their morphology after attachment to the chitosan surfaces. Thus, chitosan-based biomaterial surfaces have good hepatocyte attachment properties, However, extensive neovascularization is essential for hepatocyte survival and organoid formation. In the future, chitosan-based biomaterials may be useful as scaffolds for creating liver tissue organoids.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Liver Biosupport & Hepatitis Res Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Ankara Univ, Dept Chem, Ankara, Turkey","Dixit, V (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Liver Biosupport & Hepatitis Res Lab, 675 Circle Dr S,MRL Room 1240, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,"Elcin, Yasar Murat/0000-0003-1037-0825",,,,25,49,58,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Saos-2 cells were plated on Tivanium (Tiv, Ti-6Al-4V), Zimaloy (Zim, Co-Cr-Mo) and glass disks. The cells were cultured in a-TviEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg ml( )(-1) ascorbic acid. The cultures were analyzed for calcification and for mRNA expression for ECM proteins after 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Calcium content was significantly higher in cells on Tiv, less on Zim and least on glass disks. With the addition of 3 mM b-glycerophosphate (b-GP), the cell layer was more calcified on Zim than on Tiv and all substrates had three times more calcium than cultures without b-GP. All subsequent experiments were performed without b-GP. Phalloidin immunofluorescence microscopy of the actin-based cytoskeleton at 2 weeks demonstrated nodules composed of multilayered, cobblestone-appearing osteoblasts overlying calcified matrix which was stained with calcein. On Tiv, calcified nodules were connected in a trabecular-like pattern while on Zim, calcification was dispersed throughout the cell layer. Northern blots for alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and al(I) procollagen mRNAs were performed at different time points. The amount and pattern of calcification as well as the expression of ECM-mRNAs differed on each implant material. The results indicate that Tiv stimulates the production of more ECM proteins and mineralized matrix than Zim or glass in this osteoblast-like cell/implant culture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Antibiotic bonding was obtained by soaking the meshes for 15 min in a solution containing 20 mg ml(-1) rifampicin or 10 mg ml(-1) of vancomycin or gentamicin. A polymer mesh was implanted in a subcutaneous pouch in 16 rabbits: four received a rifampicin-soaked mesh, four received a vancomycin-soaked mesh, four received a gentamicin-soaked mesh, and four received an untreated mesh (control group). At the time of implantation, all the meshes were contaminated locally with 10(8) colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. Meshes were harvested one week later and submitted to bacterial counts. At the time of explantation, none of the antibiotic-soaked meshes were infected, whereas all the untreated meshes were infected. These results show that antibiotic soaking evidently prevents perioperative infection of gelatin-coated knitted polymer meshes in this model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The resulting polymers were random copolymers with weight average molecular weights from 40 000 to 200 000 dalton. Chemical structure and purity were confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectral analysis. General structure-property correlations were established. The glass transition temperature decreased with increasing PEG content and increasing pendent chain length. When higher molecular weight PEG blocks were used, the glass transition temperature increased relative to identical polymers having shorter PEG blocks. The tensile modulus increased with decreasing PEG content, decreasing pendent chain length, and when longer PEG blocks were used. Water uptake and the rate of backbone degradation increased with increasing PEG content. Microspheres could be prepared by solvent evaporation techniques from copolymers with low PEG content. Release rate of pNA and FITC-dextran from the microspheres increased with increasing PEG content. While tyrosine-derived polycarbonates were excellent substrates for cell attachment and growth, the presence of only 5 mol% of PEG(1000),, led to low or no cell attachment in short-term cell culture with both rat lung fibroblasts and osteoblasts.

The observed transition temperature varied slightly depending on the technique used, e.g. CD always gave a lower temperature than UV/Vis. CD and UV/Vis studies indicated that the transition temperature was both heating rate and concentration dependent. Thermodynamic parameters of the transition (enthalpy, entropy, and free energy) were determined by DSC. The molecularity of the transition was 2.6, as calculated from UV and DSC data. The transition temperature could be varied from 18 to 58?C by changing the polymer structure.

Our study targeted the spreading behavior of human PMN adherent to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), pretreated with various plasma proteins, in response to the chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). To this end, a novel imaging configuration was developed to allow in situ reconstructive analysis of PMN 3-D morphology on opaque ePTFE surfaces, using optical sectioning confocal microscopy. Following fMLP stimulation, PMN morphological polarity was enhanced on all substrates studied except fibrinogen treated ePTFE. 3-D PMN morphometry revealed that in the absence of fMLP, overall cell spreading was minimized on albumin-treated ePTFE and maximized on fibrinogen and immunoglobulin-G-treated ePTFE. Following fMLP stimulation, overall PMN spreading increased markedly on untreated and albumin-coated ePTFE, while it stayed invariant on IgG and plasma treated ePTFE, and decreased on fibrinogen similar to treated ePTFE. Spatial analysis of PMN spreading following fMLP stimulation revealed enhanced PMN attachment on untreated and albumin treated ePTFE and diminished attachment on fibrinogen and plasma treated ePTFE. Thus, chemoattractant stimulation altered a wide range of PMN spreading attributes on ePTFE, including morphological polarity, substrate attachment, and 3-D membrane spreading, in a substrate dependent manner. These chemoattractant-induced spreading responses may also have important consequences for PMN phagocytosis. We report that fMLP stimulation led to enhanced unopsonized particulate phagocytosis on untreated and albumin treated ePTFE, but caused no discernible change in phagocytosis on other protein substrates. Thus, chemoattractant modulation of PMN spreading on ePTFE is highly substrate-regulated, and manifests in concerted effects on PMN phagocytosis. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used the MTT colorimetric test to assess cell viability and flow cytometry to evaluate cell proliferation. Tests were conducted at 24 and 72 h. Changes in cell morphology were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Positive (polyurethane) and negative (polystyrene) toxicity controls were included. The number of viable cells was significantly higher on polystyrene than on polyurethane. A decrease in the total number of cells from 24 to 72 h compared to the negative control was correlated with a lower percentage of S-phase cells. The differences in cell viability noted between the samples and the polystyrene control mainly resulted from an initial lack of adhesion, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The biocompatibility of the three silicone rubbers was comparable to the best of the three products currently being used. These results, combined with those of the previous study, indicate that silicone rubber could be considered for the manufacture of mouth guards. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

These methods, often capable of achieving atomic resolutions, reveal fascinating information regarding the inner workings of these materials. However, both STM and AFM require physical contact to the specimen. In the case of STM, the specimen needs to be conducting as well. Here we introduce a new method for imaging biological materials through air or a suitable liquid using decaying or evanescent fields at the tip of a properly designed microwave resonator. This novel method involves the use of an evanescent microwave probe (EMP) and is capable of imaging a variety of non-uniformities in biological materials including conductivity, permittivity, and density variations. EMP is a non-contact and non-destructive sensor and it does not require conducting specimens. Its spatial resolution is currently around 0.4 mu m m at 1 GHz. We have used this probe to map non-uniformities in a variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and biological and botanical samples. Here we discuss applications of EMP imaging in bone, teeth, botanical, and agricultural specimens.","[Tabib-Azar, M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Macromol Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Tabib-Azar, M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Phys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Bumrerraj, S.; Katz, J.

Each polypeptide chain of collagen is composed of repeats of the sequence: Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are often L-proline (Pro) and 4(R)-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) residues, respectively. These chains are wound into tight triple helices of great stability, The hydroxyl group of Hyp residues contributes much to this conformational stability. The existing paradigm is that this stability arises from interstrand hydrogen bonds mediated by bridging water molecules, This model was tested using chemical synthesis to replace Hyp residues with 4(R)-fluoro-L-proline (Flp) residues. The fluorine atom in Flp residues does not form hydrogen bonds but does elicit strong inductive effects, Results: Replacing the Hyp residues in collagen with Flp residues greatly increases triple-helical stability. The free energy contributed by the fluorine atom in Flp residues is twice that of the hydroxyl group in Hyp residues. The stability of the Flp-containing triple helix far exceeds that of any untemplated collagen mimic of similar size. Conclusions: Bridging water molecules contribute little to collagen stability. Rather, collagen stability relies on previously unappreciated inductive effects. Collagen mimics containing fluorine or other appropriate electron-withdrawing substituents could be the basis of new biomaterials for restorative therapies.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raines, RT (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Raines, Ronald/A-5009-2013","Raines, Ronald/0000-0001-7164-1719",NIAMS NIH HHS [AR44276],,,71,197,200,3,23,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",1074-5521,,,CHEM BIOL,Chem.

A manual measurement of the size of the bone defect, using a plastic probe, was performed at 2 surgical steps. After 5 months of treatment, a biopsy was taken from each patient, fixed and embedded in PMMA, examined microradiographically and morphologically to evaluate the newly-formed bone. Our results showed a good repair of the defects by bone regeneration (about 85% overall), high mineral density of new bone around the implants after 5 months, and steady state deposition processes.

Design: Animal study. Setting: School of medicine, Spain. Material: 48 New Zealand white rabbits divided into 4 groups of 12 each. Interventions: Full thickness defects 50 x 70 mm were created in the abdominal wall and repaired with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Soft Tissue Patch(R)), one of two polypropylene patches (Marlex(R) and Prolene(R)), or lyophylised dura mater (LyoDura(R)). 3 animals from each group were killed at 14, 30, 60 and 90 days and specimens examined by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and immune histochemistry by labelling of macrophages with RAM-11, a specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Main outcome measures: Infection, healing, development of adhesions, and histological appearance of the interface. Results: Tissues responded similarly to materials of similar structures. Layered prostheses (PTFE and Lyo-Dura(R)) caused formation of a well organised neoperitoneum with few adhesions to the abdominal viscera (loose adhesions in. animals in each group), whereas the mesh prostheses generated a disorganised neoperitoneum with many adhesions (Marlex(R) loose adhesions 3, firm 8, and integrated 1; Prolene(R) loose adhesions 2, firm 8, and integrated 2). Lyo-Dura(R) was associated with the formation of areas of calcification. Labelling of macrophages with the MoAb showed that they were in direct contact with all materials studied. Conclusions: Layered biomaterials with Little or no porosity (PTFE and Lyo-Dura(R)) are the most suitable of the four for implantation in sites where the prosthesis is in contact with the visceral peritoneum, because they induce minimal adhesions.","Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Madrid 28871, Spain","Bellon, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Crta Madrid Barcelona,Km 33600, Madrid 28871, Spain.",,,"PASCUAL, GEMMA/0000-0002-1623-4384; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,19,31,33,0,2,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Analysis was carried out using on-line flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and off-line flash (vacuum) pyrolysis followed by GC/MS. Standard samples of hexoses, pentoses, deoxyhexoses, lactose, cellulose and starch were treated with 25% aqueous TMAH (100 times excess by weight). Approximately 50 mu g (for on-line analysis) or 250 mu g (for off-line analysis) of the carbohydrate/TMAH mixture was heated to 700 degrees C (10 s) using a quartz holder and a CDS pyroprobe, From electron and chemical impact mass spectral data, and, from literature on alkaline decomposition of carbohydrates, tentative structures of unique products and the mechanisms of their formation are proposed. A series of permethylated deoxy aldonic acids are tentatively identified as key products. It is postulated that these 'saccharinic acids' are initially formed from the action of alkali on reducing sugars which are then subsequently methylated. In addition, thermochemolytic analysis of lactose, cellulose and starch afforded their own unique permethylated deoxy aldonic acids as well producing methoxy benzene products, i.e. 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, 2,4-dimethoxyphenol. It is believed that glycosidically-linked saccharides initially degrade under alkaline conditions similar to the so-called 'peeling reaction' observed for cellulose under alkaline pulping conditions and then are finally methylated. An algal sample has been analyzed for its carbohydrate composition. The observation of hexose, pentose and polysaccharide thermochemolysis products illustrate the potential of the method to characterize the saccharide composition of more complex biomaterials.

Flow cell studies of the interaction between bacteria and surfaces do not generally allow direct comparison of different materials using the same bacterial suspension. The use of a modified Robbins Device (MRD) to compare the adhesion to different surfaces of Staph. epidermidis RP62A grown in continuous culture was investigated. Adhesion to glass was compared with siliconized glass, plasma-conditioned glass, titanium, stainless steel and Teflon. Attachment to siliconized glass was also compared with glass under differing ionic strength, and divalent cation concentrations. Both the differences in numbers adhering and changes in adhesion (slope) through the MRD were compared. There was a trend towards higher numbers adhering to the discs at the in-flow end of the MRD than at the outflow end, probably reflecting depletion of adherent bacteria in the interacting stream. Adhesion of Staph. epidermidis RP62A to siliconized glass and Teflon was reduced when compared to glass with increasing flow rates. Adhesion to stainless steel nias not affected by flow rate and titanium gave a different slope of adhesion through the MRD when compared with glass, suggesting an interaction with different sub-populations within the interacting stream. Differences between siliconized glass and glass at flow rates of 300 mi h(-1) were abolished by the addition of calcium or EDTA and reduced by the addition of magnesium. Increasing ionic strength reduced the statistical significance of the differences between glass and siliconized glass, Pre-conditioning of glass with pooled human plasma reduced adhesion compared with untreated glass and again gave a different slope to glass. The MRD linked to a chemostat call be used to compare directly bacterial adhesion to potential biomaterials. Variable depiction of the interacting stream should be taken into account in the interpretation of results. Divalent cation concentration, substrate properties and flow rate were important determinants of the comparative adhesion of Staph. epidermidiss RP62A to surfaces.","Univ Bristol, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England; Univ Bristol, Dept Paediat Epidemiol, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England","Millar, MR (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Royal Infirm, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Level 8,Marlborough St, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England.",,,"sherriff, andrea/0000-0002-1016-037X",,,,33,15,15,0,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-5072,,,J APPL MICROBIOL,J.

Microfabrication techniques have enabled the production of precisely controlled surface topographies that have been used as substrata for cells in culture and on devices implanted in vivo. This article reviews aspects of cell behavior involved in tissue response to implants with an emphasis on the effects of topography. Microfabricated grooved surfaces produce orientation and directed locomotion of epithelial cells in vitro and can inhibit epithelial downgrowth on implants. The effects depend on the groove dimensions and they are modified by epithelial cell-cell interactions. Fibroblasts similarly exhibit contact guidance on grooved surfaces, but fibroblast shape in vitro differs markedly from that found in vivo. Surface topography is important in establishing tissue organization adjacent to implants, with smooth surfaces generally being associated with fibrous tissue encapsulation. Grooved topographies appear to have promise in reducing encapsulation ii in the short term, but additional studies employing three-dimensional reconstruction and diverse topographies are needed to understand better the process of connective-tissue organization adjacent to implants. Microfabricated surfaces can increase the frequency of mineralized bone-like tissue nodules adjacent to subcutaneously implanted surfaces in rats. Orientation of these nodules with grooves occurs both in culture and on implants. Detailed comparisons of cell behavior on micromachined substrata in vitro and in vivo are difficult because of the number and complexity of factors, such as population density and micromotion, that cart differ between these conditions.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Med Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Brunette, DM (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Med Sci, 2199 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",,,,,,,62,250,251,5,46,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

In the present work, we have electrochemically synthesized composites comprising heparin and the electrically conducting polymer polypyrrole. The incorporation and exposure of heparin were controlled by varying key conditions of polymer synthesis (i.e., applied current and synthesis time). The resulting composite polymers were electroactive after synthesis and the amount of heparin exposed in the polymer could be increased (up to threefold) by switching the polymers from their oxidized to reduced states. Polymer reduction was achieved by either application of negative potentials (-0.4 to -0.7 V for 90 s) or exposure to aqueous reductant (0.1M sodium dithionite for 30 min). Heparin-polypyrrole composites remained stable after autoclaving, displaying no significant loss of electroactivity, and had a shelf life of at least 2 years postautoclaving.

Polystyrene was used as a model hydrophobic polymer; i.e., we expected that the role of fibrinogen in platelet adhesion to polystyrene would be representative of other hydrophobic polymers. Platelet adhesion was compared to both the amount and conformation of adsorbed fibrinogen. The strategy was to compare platelet adhesion to surfaces preadsorbed with normal, afibrinogenemic, and fibrinogen-replenished afibrinogenemic plasmas. Platelet adhesion was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) method, which was found to be closely correlated with adhesion of In-111-labeled platelets. Fibrinogen adsorption from afibrinogenemic plasma to polystyrene (Immulon I(R)) was low and <10 ng/cm(2). Platelet adhesion was absent on surfaces preadsorbed with afibrinogenemic plasma when the residual fibrinogen was low enough (<60 mu g/mL). Platelet adhesion was restored on polystyrene preadsorbed with fibrinogen-replenished afibrinogenemic plasma. Addition of even small, subnormal concentrations of fibrinogen to afibrinogenemic plasma greatly increased platelet adhesion. In addition, surface-bound fibrinogen's ability to mediate platelet adhesion was different, depending on the plasma concentration from which fibrinogen was adsorbed. These differences correlated with changes in the binding of a monoclonal antibody that binds to the A alpha chain RGDS (572-575), suggesting alteration in the conformation or orientation of the adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion to polystyrene preadsorbed with blood plasma thus appears to be a strongly bivariate function of adsorbed fibrinogen, responsive to both low amounts and altered states of the adsorbed molecule.

To explore the in vitro effects of surface immobilized PEO on the human inflammatory cells, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), we developed a diisocyanate-based method for coupling PEG to amine-modified glass, a surface previously shown to enhance macrophage adhesion and FBGC formation. Contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of PEG molecules bound to the surface and revealed that PEG molecular weight significantly influenced the efficiency of PEO coupling. We used a 10-day human monocyte culture protocol to demonstrate that the presence of surface coupled PEG molecules does not significantly decrease initial monocyte density or monocyte-derived macrophage density after 3 days. However, PEG-coupled surfaces significantly reduced long-term monocyte-derived macrophage density and virtually eliminated interleukin-4-induced FBGC formation observed at day 10. The cellular response to these PEG-coupled surfaces was related to the molecular weight of the PEG chains, which was varied between 200 Da and 18.5 kDa. These results suggest that an optimized PEG surface treatment may be effective in reducing inflammatory cell adhesion and possible degradation during the inflammatory response to an implanted biomedical device.

Many of these new controlled release systems utilize active biological components, i.e., proteins and cells, to achieve their intended therapeutic goal. Utilization of bioactive biological materials in implantable controlled release systems has prompted a broad as well as an in-depth interest in the safety and efficacy of these systems. This short review is intended to provide individuals with a perspective on standards and guidance documents which specifically address biological and immunotoxicity response evaluation for safety of controlled release systems from a regulatory point of view.

PLLA dissolved by using methylene chloride was mixed with the fibers. After drying the mixture, it was hot-pressed uniaxially under a pressure of 40 MPa at 180 degrees C, resulting in fabrication of a PLLA composite containing beta-Ca(PO3)(2) fibers. Almost no degradation in the bending strength was observed even when a large amount of the fibers (approximate to 50 wt. %) was introduced, and the modulus of elasticity was increased effectively with increasing the fiber content. The PLLA composite with modulus of elasticity of >5 GPa similar to that of natural bone was found to be prepared when the fiber content was over 35 wt. %, The bending test of the composites showed that very high energy is consumed for their fracture and that the fracture proceeds step by step, even beyond the maximum stress.","Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan","Kasuga, T (reprint author), Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan.",,,,,,,20,18,20,0,4,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DR, WARRENDALE, PA 15086 USA",0884-2914,,,J MATER RES,J.

Our approach also includes the incorporation of the peptoid residue N-isobutylglycine into the design for novel collagen-like sequences. We have synthesized and characterized acetylated single chain and template-assembled analogs composed of Gly-Pro-Nleu and GIy-Nleu-Pro sequences. The achiral trimeric unit Gly-Nleu-Nleu was included as a guest sequence in a host structure such as Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-NleuNleu)(3)-(GIy-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 which retains triple helicity. A series of guest-host collagen mimetics composed of Gly-Nleu-Pro sequences as the host were synthesized and assessed for triple helicity. Guest sequences include Gly-Nleu-Nleu and Gly-Nx-Pro units, where Nx is the guest peptoid residue with alkyl and aralkyl side chains.

Ion-beam-based processes, such as ion implantation and ion-beam assisted deposition (IBAD) can provide beneficial surface layers with desirable properties without detrimentally affecting the bulk properties. Ion implantation has been successful in biomaterials modification, such as in improving the wear resistance of artificial joint components, in improving wettability, anticoagulability, anticalcific behavior of biomedical polymers, and in minimizing biofouling of medical devices, etc. IBAD has been used to prepare hydroxyapatite coatings with high adhesive strength on substrates of several implant materials. Biocompatible diamond-like carbon coatings and C-N films, antibacterial coatings and sealant coatings have also been produced by this technique. This paper reviews the present status of applications of the ion-beam process in modifying the surface of biomaterials, as well as the effects induced by ion-beam irradiation to crop seeds, cells and microbes.

Although device replacement can be considered an easy outpatient procedure. frequent replacements are inconvenient for the patient and may lead to malfunction of the tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Further understanding of the process of development and inhibition of the colonization of these polymer surfaces requires several comprehensive clinical studies. How ever, iii vivo research of the biomaterials of the voice prostheses is difficult and time consuming. In order to simulate the natural process of biofilm development under dynamic nutrient conditions, an artificial throat was developed. Biofilm developed on Groningen(R) button voice prostheses iii vitro a could not be distinguished from that formed over several months in,vitro.

For example, the freezing of an aqueous solution within a hydrophobic liquid gives a basic model for the freezing of biomaterials. Furthermore, the melting of an ice layer has close relations to cold thermal storage using ice. In the present study, both perfluolocarbon (PFC) and silicon oil were adopted as the testing liquids. The ambient liquid temperatures ranged from 5 to 40 degrees C. The inclination angle of the ice plate was varied from 0 to 180 degrees at 30 degrees steps.

These stimulations by the immobilized growth factors may mimick juxtacrine stimulation of membrane-anchored growth factors such as heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor, and tumor nectrosis factor. The stimulation was enhanced by coimmobilization with adhesion factors.

Previous studies from our laboratory have reported the tumorigenic potentials of these PUs in vivo and in vitro. PU-components had inhibited the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in cultures of mouse Balb/c (A31-1-1) and chinese hamster V79 fibroblasts. Since GJIC is crucial for normal differentiation of a cell population, this perturbed gap junction is most likely to play the major role in the PU-induced tumorigenesis. Gap junctions are composed of a multigene family of proteins called connexins. Various tumor promoters have been shown to inhibit GJIC by phosphorylation modification of connexin proteins. Mutations in connexin genes have also been found to lead abnormally regulated cell-cell communication. We are interested to elucidate the mecahnism of tumorigenesis induced by biomaterials including PUs. Ln the present study, we choose three PU-induced tumor clones, namely clone-2, 5 and 6, isolated from A31-1-1 cells, for investigation of mutation in their cx43 gene, the major gap junction protein of this cell line. The connexin43 (cx43) gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The entire coding region located in the exon 2 of ex 43 gene was sequenced directly from the PCR amplified product. None of the clones showed a difference in their cx43 sequences with the published sequence for mouse cx43 sequence. Thus, probably a post-translational modification or a defect in gene expression, but, not a mutation in the coding sequence of cx43, is involved in the polyurethane-induced inhibition of GJIC during the tumorigenesis in vitro.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-5805-8,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,181,185,,,,,,5,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,BP18F,WOS:000084339700033,,,,,2019-02-25

Current treatments, although fairly successful, do not provide the optimum therapy. These treatments typically rely on donor tissues obtained either from the patient or from another source. The former raises the issue of supply, whereas the latter poses the risk of rejection and disease transfer. This has prompted orthopedic surgeons and scientists to look for viable alternatives. In recent years, tissue engineering has gained increasing support as a method to treat orthopedic disorders. Because it uses principles of engineering, biology, and chemistry, tissue engineering may provide a more effective approach to the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders than traditional methods.

Bubble collapse in liquids results in an enormous concentration of energy from the conversion of the kinetic energy of the liquid motion into heating of the contents of the bubble. The high local temperatures and pressures, combined with extraordinarily rapid cooling, provide a unique means for driving chemical reactions under extreme conditions. A diverse set of applications of ultrasound to enhance chemical reactivity has been explored with important uses in synthetic materials chemistry. For example, the sonochemical decomposition of volatile organometallic precursors in low-volatility solvents produces nanostructured materials in various forms with high catalytic activities. Nanostructured metals, alloys, oxides, carbides and sulfides, nanometer colloids, and nanostructured supported catalysts can all be prepared by this general route. Another important application of sonochemistry in materials chemistry has been the preparation of biomaterials, most notably protein microspheres. Such microspheres have a wide range of biomedical applications, including their use in echo contrast agents for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, contrast enhancement, and oxygen or drug delivery. Other applications include the modification of polymers and polymer surfaces.","Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Bath, Dept Chem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ksuslick@uiuc.edu; chsgjp@bath.ac.uk,"Price, Gareth/B-5293-2011; Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011","Price, Gareth/0000-0003-4983-5722; Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701",,,,143,1103,1133,31,461,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0084-6600,,,ANNU REV MATER SCI,Annu.

To this end, type I collagen coatings containing a model biomolecule, lysozyme, were deposited on Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. Two deposition methods were examined. In the first, lysozyme was deposited concurrently with collagen, while in the second, protein was impregnated into previously deposited collagen coatings. The amount of collagen and the amount of lysozyme loaded into collagen were varied to provide different amounts of weakly and strongly bound protein. Release and retention of lysozyme were monitored over a 7 d period of incubation in physiological saline. For both methods, larger amounts of collagen in the coatings allowed incorporation of more lysozyme. Additionally, loading collagen coatings with greater amounts of lysozyme resulted in release of more protein. During the first 24-96 h of incubation, loosely bound protein was eluted, resulting in release of 2 mu g to 55 mg (5-75% of the amount available) of enzymatically active lysozyme. This left 25-95% of the protein bound to the collagen-coated biomaterials and, thus, available for later release during degradation of the collagen.","Univ Kentucky, Ctr Biomed Engn, Wenner Gren Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Puleo, DA (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Ctr Biomed Engn, Wenner Gren Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",,,,,,,9,9,10,0,2,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",1073-1199,,,ARTIF CELL BLOOD SUB,Artif.

Our studies have established that heterogeneous mimetic peptide surfaces (MPS) containing both the -RGD- (cell-binding) and FHRRIKA- (putative heparin-binding) peptides, unique to BSP, in the ratio of 75:25 (MPS II) or 50:50 (RIPS LII) proved to be more biologically relevant and specific for RCO cell function. The initial response of human osteoblast-like cells to these surfaces was mediated by the collagen (alpha(2)beta(1)) and vitronectin receptors (alpha(v)beta(3)), whereas the vitronectin receptor alone dominated longer-term events (> 30 min). MPS II and III surfaces enhanced cell spreading and longterm events such as mineralization of the extracellular matrix compared to homogenous peptide surfaces and controls. Furthermore, extensive mineralization of the ECM deposited by RCOs occurred when the peptide was coupled to an interfacial interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) that resisted protein deposition (i.e., non-specific adsorption) and fouling, Work on thermo-reversible P(NIPAAm-co-AAc) hydrogels demonstrated the ability to create materials that can be delivered to the body in a minimally invasive manner and support tissue regeneration. These hydrogels can be modified to incorporate biofunctional components such as the biomimetic peptides, theoretically enhancing their ability to foster tissue regeneration. These results suggest that biomaterials can be engineered to mimic ECM components of bone (e.g., various organs) by grafting peptides in the appropriate ratios of the cell and heparin-binding domains, and ultimately modulate the expression of the osteoblast cell phenotype, Approaches similar to the one presented in this work can be used to design materials for hybrid artificial organs and other tissues.","Northwestern Univ, Div Biol Mat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; Robert R McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60201 USA","Healy, KE (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Div Biol Mat, 311 E Chicago Ave,Ward Bldg 10-116, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR43187]; NIDCR NIH HHS [T32 DE07042],,,31,130,141,1,29,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-194-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,1999.0,875,,,,,,24,35,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08491.x,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Transplantation",Engineering; Materials Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Transplantation,BN31W,WOS:000081586000003,10415555.0,,,,2019-02-25

The research on the use of zirconia ceramics as biomaterials started about twenty years ago, and now zirconia (Y-YZP) is in clinical use in THR, but developments are in progress for application in other medical devices. Recent developments have concentrated on the chemistry of precursors, in forming and sintering processes, and on surface finish of components. Today's main applications of zirconia ceramics is in THR ball heads. This review takes into account the main results achieved up to now, and is focused on the role that microstructural characteristics play on the TZP ceramics behaviour in ball heads, namely mechanical properties and their stability, wear of the UHMWPE paired to TZP, and their influence on biocompatibility.

Alginates possess many favorable properties required in biomaterials, but are unable to specifically interact with mammalian cells. We have therefore covalently modified alginate polysaccharides with RGD-containing cell adhesion ligands utilizing aqueous carbodiimide chemistry. The chemistry has been optimized and quantified with reaction efficiencies reaching 80% or greater. The concentration of peptide available for reaction was then varied to create hydrogels with a range of ligand densities. Mouse skeletal myoblasts were cultured on alginate hydrogel surfaces coupled with GRGDY peptides to illustrate achievement of cellular interaction with the otherwise non-adhesive hydrogel substrate. Myoblasts adhere to GRGDY-modified alginate surfaces, proliferate, fuse into multinucleated myofibrils, and express heavy-chain myosin which is a differentiation marker for skeletal muscle. Myoblast adhesion and spreading on these GRGDY-modified hydrogels was inhibited with soluble ligand added to the seeding medium, illustrating the specificity of adhesion to these materials. Alginate may prove to be an ideal material with which to confer specific cellular interactive properties, potentially allowing for the control of long-term gene expression of cells within these matrices.

Polyethylene-glycol-diisocyanate (PEG-diisocyanate, 3400 MW) may potentially react with protein amines to form molecular barriers on adsorbed proteins on biomaterials, thereby masking adhesive ligands and preventing acute surface thrombosis. To test this notion, PE, PTFE, and glass microconduits were pre-adsorbed with fibrinogen and treated with PEG-diisocyanate, non-reactive PEG-dihydroxyl, or remained untreated. Following perfusion of In-111-labeled platelets in whole human blood for 1 min (wall shear rate = 312 s(-1)), PEG-diisocyanate treated surfaces experienced 96% (PE), 97% (PTFE) and 94% (glass) less platelet deposition than untreated surfaces. Similar reductions were seen for PEG-diisocyanate versus PEG-dihydroxyl treatment. Low shear perfusions of plasma for one hour prior to blood contact did not reduce the inhibitory effect of PEG-diisocyanate. Platelet adhesion onto collagen coated glass coverslips and platelet deposition onto preclotted Dacron was also reduced by treatment with PEG-diisocyanate (93 and 91 %, respectively). Protein-reactive PEG may thus have utility in forming molecular barriers on surface associated proteins to inhibit acute thrombosis on cardiovascular biomaterials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Crosslinking of cruciate samples was carried out with: (i) no applied load, (ii) an initial 25 g (similar to 30 kPa) equibiaxial load, or (iii) an initial 200 g (similar to 250 kPa) equibiaxial load. All loading during crosslinking was done under a defined initial equibiaxial load and subsequently fixed biaxial strain. Load changes during crosslinking were monitored. Mechanical testing and constraint during crosslinking were carried out in a custom-built biaxial servo-hydraulic testing system incorporating four actuators with phase-controlled waveform synthesis, high frame-rate video dimension analysis, and computer-interfaced data acquisition The paired biaxial stress-strain responses under equibiaxial loading at 1 Hz (before and after treatment) were evaluated for changes in anisotropic extensibility by calculation of an anisotropy index. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on freeze-fractured samples to relate collagen crimp morphology to constraint during crosslinking. Fresh tissue was markedly anisotropic with the base-to-apex direction of the pericardium being less extensible and stiffer than the circumferential direction. After unconstrained crosslinking, the extensibility in the circumferential direction, the stiffness in the base-to-apex direction, and the tissue's anisotropy were all reduced. Anisotropy was preserved in the tissue treated with an applied 25 g load; however, tissue treated with an applied 200 g load became extremely stiff and nearly isotropic. SEM micrographs correlated well with observed extensibility in that the collagen fibre morphology changed from very crimped (unconstrained crosslinking), to straight (200 g applied load). Biaxial stress-fixation may allow engineering of bioprosthetic materials for specific medical applications. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The improvement in the interface compatibility of polymers selected for implantation by directed surface modification is an important contribution to biomaterial development. Different polymer properties are adjusted and characterized independently of the carrier polymer by means of introduction of modern surface analytical methods and surface techniques. In addition, the interactions between the modified polymer surface and the biological system are measured. In this way, the hydrophilization of a polyurethane (Tecolex(TM)) and a poly(ether sulfone) by plasma induced graftcopolymerization of hydrogels like poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) leads to improved blood compatibility. Functionalization by means of SO2 plasma treatment of medical grade poly(vinyl chloride) increases the adsorption of the basal membrane protein fibronectin, which correlates with an improvement in cell growth. A suitable interface for an improved cell growth of hum an vascular endothelial cells as well as for cornea endothelial cells has been created by immobilization of the cell adhesion mediator fibronectin using bifunctional spacer molecules at several carrier polymer surfaces like smooth poly(vinyl chloride), modified polyurethane, Tecoflex(TM) and poly(dimethyl siloxane).","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Text Chem & Macromol Chem, D-52062 Aachen, Germany","Klee, D (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Text Chem & Macromol Chem, Veltmanpl 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",klee@dwi.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,153,111,113,2,59,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-3195,,3-540-65933-1,ADV POLYM SCI,Adv.

The binding of thrombin to immobilized fibrinogen was mostly reversible, the bound thrombin could be inhibited by milimolar concentration of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF). at least three sets of different thrombin binding sites were found. There was a residual fraction of thrombin bound to washed fibrin(ogen) (to about a five to ten percent of fibrin monomer units) suggesting that a known naturally occurring fibrinogen variant differing in the gamma chain was the target. Surface bound fibrinogen was converted by thrombin to fibrin monomer that interacted with fibrinogen in solution. At low fibrin monomer surface density the second layer was formed that contained about the same amount of protein as the first layer, at higher fibrin monomer concentration less than one molecule of fibrinogen per molecule of fibrin monomer was captured.

In this paper, we will expand on the use of wheat gluten films as active layers, i.e. when the film contribute by itself to the food preservation. Some potential uses of these biomaterials (e.g. modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables, slow release of food preservatives) are described with examples. The development of biopackaging or edible films with selective gas permeability is very promising for controlling respiratory exchange and improving the conservation of fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. Wheat gluten films appear to have suitable O-2 barrier properties while remaining relatively permeable to CO2. The gas permeability's of gluten based films were measured at various temperatures and relative humidites. O-2/CO2 selectivity increased from 3 (at 4 degrees C and low RH) to more than 45 (at 40 degrees c and 95%RH). Some selective gluten-based films have been shown to lead to the creation of very original atmospheres when used to wrap fresh mushrooms. The modified atmosphere rise to an equilibrium composition of 2-3% CO2 and 2-3% O-2 which is favourable to the mushroom overall quality. The diffusion of sorbic acid in various wheat gluten film was studied and the release from the film to a model food was measured and modelled, The anti-microbial effect of various edible gluten I sorbic acid based films was evaluated against Penicillium notatum. Simple gluten-based films had no own fungicidal effect but the gluten I lipid based films showed a strong sorbic acid retention and a marked own fungicidal effect, either at 30 degrees C or 4 degrees C, delaying the Penicillium notatum growth for more then 21 days.","INRA, ENSAM, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France","Guilbert, S (reprint author), INRA, ENSAM, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INST NATL RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE,PARIS,"147 RUE DE L'UNIVERSITE, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0293-1915,,2-7380-0874-7,COLLOQ INRA,,,1999.0,,91,,,,,315,320,,,,,,6,"Agronomy; Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology",Agriculture; Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,BN59S,WOS:000082330400041,,,,,2019-02-25

The fact that these diseases have an increased incidence in uremia, and particularly in dialysis patients, suggests an increased exposure to oxidative stress in this condition. In haemodialysis (HD), the absence of a complete correction of the uremic toxicity together with the untoward effects of the dialysis, malnutrition and the progressive worsening of the clinical condition, can lead to a high susceptibility to oxidative stress by an abnormal production of oxidants - including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and uremic toxins with prooxidant function - and defective antioxidant protection. One of the most investigated biological effects of the oxidative stress in the HD patients is lipid peroxidation in plasma and blood cell membranes. Moreover, we have recently described how abnormal apoptosis in peripheral blood leukocytes is associated with cell oxidative stress (intracellular thiol depletion). Vitamin E, in both in vitro and in vivo conditions, has been proposed to partially correct these effects. in this review we evaluated some features of two new dialysis strategies using an antioxidant approach to the protection against the oxidant stress in HD. Their rationale is based on the emerging role of vitamin E in counteracting some biological effects associated with oxidant stress namely lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. These techniques use: 1) the recirculation of the dialysate through a suspension of vitamin E-enriched liposomes combined with the supplementation by the dialysate with ascorbic acid, this method has been called hemolipodialysis; 2) the coating of the dialysis membrane with vitamin E (vitamin E-modified dialysis membranes). These unconventional approaches to the antioxidant therapy in HD open a widely unexplored and promising field in the evolution of the biomaterials and dialysis quality.","Univ Urbino, G Fornaini Inst Biol Chem, I-61029 Urbino, PS, Italy","Galli, F (reprint author), Univ Urbino, G Fornaini Inst Biol Chem, Via Saffi 2, I-61029 Urbino, PS, Italy.",,"Galli, Francesco/K-5048-2016","Galli, Francesco/0000-0003-3626-051X",,,,71,54,55,0,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0253-5068,,,BLOOD PURIFICAT,Blood Purif.,,1999.0,17,2-3,,,,,79,94,,10.1159/000014379,,,,16,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,229RQ,WOS:000082208700004,10449865.0,,,,2019-02-25

From the original description of continuous arterio-venous haemofiltration, new techniques such as continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration and high flux dialysis have been developed and clinically utilised. A parallel improvement in efficiency has been achieved with urea daily clearances as high as 50 litres or more. The use of special highly permeable dialysers has also permitted to increase the clearances of larger solutes thus leading to significant removals of chemical substances involved in the acute inflammation and sepsis. In this field, recent observations have suggested to use haemofiltration with high volumes of fluid exchange. The hardware and software of the newer continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) are certainly the key point in achieving these results and in safely performing such challenging techniques.","St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy","Ronco, C (reprint author), St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,31,11,11,1,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0253-5068,,,BLOOD PURIFICAT,Blood Purif.,,1999.0,17,2-3,,,,,166,172,,10.1159/000014389,,,,7,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,229RQ,WOS:000082208700014,10449875.0,,,,2019-02-25

Images of internal strain or displacement may provide valuable information about pathological processes such as edema and fibrosis which are known to alter the mechanical properties of tissue. In this study we developed experimental methods for measuring internal deformation in highly scattering tissue with OCT and applied them to tissue phantoms and living tissue. Piezoelectric actuators were configured to compress the samples in steps of 5-10 mu m as images were captured synchronously using either a frame or a line-by-line acquisition mode. The displacements of structures inside the samples were quantified using speckle-tracking algorithms based on cross correlation or optical flow of selected features. Displacements as small as a few micrometers were measurable in heterogeneous gelatin phantoms containing scattering particles and living skin. The results suggest that the composition of tissues layers whose elasticities differ greatly (e.g., fat and muscle) can be deduced visually from image sequences without the need for complicated image processing. However, better models are needed to transform the displacement images into quantitative maps of subtle regional variations of the elastic modulus.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Schmitt, JM (reprint author), Nellcor Puritan Bennett Corp, 4280 Hacienda Dr, Pleasanton, CA 94588 USA.",,,,,,,8,5,5,1,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3068-4,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3598,,,,,,47,55,,10.1117/12.347506,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics",Engineering; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics,BN09M,WOS:000080656800006,,,,,2019-02-25

Operation of the pilot plant included harvesting the kelp, grinding it into a slurry, reacting the slurry with Calcium Chloride, draining the excess water, and combined fields dewatering. The operations indicated that the Calcium Chloride reaction followed by draining was a necessary step for an effective water removal with the combined fields roller press.

Sucrose systems showed, by far, the fastest colour development, particularly in the presence of lysine and glycine as sources of amino groups. The results confirm the extraordinary stability of trehalose.

Results were related with conventional blood compatibility measurements: albumin adsorption, fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. While contact angle measurements with water are material-related but constant in time, contact angle measurements with plasma changed over time owing to protein adsorption on the solid-liquid interface. The contact medium plasma did not influence the initial contact angle. Contact angles on PDMS decreased most in time (41 degrees) and demonstrated highest levels of conventionally measured albumin and fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. PTFE, with the lowest contact angle decrease over a 500 minutes period (19 degrees), showed low fibrinogen and albumin adsorption as well as low platelet adhesion. PU and HDPE demonstrated almost similar initial contact angles with plasma and contact angle decreases (26 and 27 degrees), intermediate protein adsorption, and platelet adhesion. We conclude that biocompatibility properties of the tested materials may be more related to the behaviour of their contact angles in time, than to the initial hydrophobic or hydrophilic state.","Univ Groningen, Inst Biomed Mat Sci & Applicatio, Div Artificial Organs, Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Dept Cardiol & Thorac Surg, Groningen, Netherlands","Rakhorst, G (reprint author), Fac Med, BMSA, Div Artificial Organs, Bloemsingel 10, NL-9712 KZ Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,11,5,5,2,21,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The quality and quantity of the coating is sensitive to application techniques, metal substrate, and manufacturing controls-all important in creating a clinically successful coating. Bioactive coatings other than hydroxyapatite have had mixed success and are generally not available for clinical use at this time. Clinical experience with hydroxyapatite-coated hip implants have focused on the femoral component, where results approach the standard of cemented components. Acetabular components have been less impressive when hydroxyapatite is the primary source of fixation without macrostructured substrate or augmentation with screws. Analysis of sequential follow-up radiographs in patients with hydroxyapatite-coated hips consistently reveals the changes associated with prompt and tenacious biologic fixation of the femoral component. These changes are apparent at 6 months and persist beyond 8 years. While the optimal design of the components, the surface structure of the metal substrate, and the ideal application method are still evolving. the use of hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses for hip arthroplasty has been proven safe and successful for clinical use where biologically fixed components are indicated.","NYU, Med Ctr, Hosp Joint Dis Orthopaed Inst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, New York, NY 10003 USA","Jaffe, WL (reprint author), NYU, Med Ctr, Hosp Joint Dis Orthopaed Inst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 301 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,203,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,4-431-70241-5,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,159,187,,,,,,29,"Materials Science, Biomaterials; Orthopedics; Surgery",Materials Science; Orthopedics; Surgery,BP76Y,WOS:000086113200016,,,,,2019-02-25

These consisted of unfunctionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blended with small percentages of either ethylene oxide (EO)- or phosphorylcholine (PC) ester-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes to increase surface hydrophilicity. The latter was formed by the hydrosilation of a dimethylsilane-terminated polydimethylsiloxane with omega-vinylphosphorylcholine ester. The ester was synthesized from 9-hydroxy-1-decene and 2-chlorotrimethylamine incorporating the phosphoryl functionality. The blends were cast from a dilute solution of chloroform onto low-density polyethylene (LDPE). A comparison of methods to implement the underwater captive bubble (UWCB) technique, the curved UWCB technique or the modified UWCB technique, a convenient method for determining theta(AW) on curved surfaces, demonstrated that both methods were accurate and precise. As the percentage of functionalized polydimethylsiloxane in a family of blends increased, theta(AW) decreased. The theta(AW) value on the EO-siloxane blends was nonetheless typically 30 degrees less than that on the PC-siloxane blends. The values of theta(AW) on blends determined with the modified UWCB technique demonstrated that too little functionalized polydimethylsiloxane was present to produce a hydrophilic surface promising hemocompatibility.","Howard Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA; Howard Univ, Dept Chem, Washington, DC 20059 USA","Collins, WE (reprint author), Howard Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",,,,,,,27,1,1,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0169-4243,,,J ADHES SCI TECHNOL,J.

We have previously reported the in situ polymerization of a single phospholipid monolayer on a self-assembled film of octadecyltrichrolosilane (OTS) on glass, as well as the polymerization of phospholipids on an amphiphilic, dialkyl-containing terpolymer bound to a gold-coated silicon wafer. We now report the polymerization of a phospholipid monolayer assembly onto an alkylated hydrogel substrate with significant alteration in both surface chemistry and mass transport properties at the hydrogel-water interface.

Polymer networks were synthesised from the PFPE macromonomers of increasing chain length and the adhesion and proliferation of corneal, vascular and bone cells was evaluated on these polymers. The polymer surfaces were quite hydrophobic, having sessile air-water contact angles ranging between 96 and 125 degrees. However, these polymers supported the attachment and growth of bovine corneal epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts at 60-100% of the rate of cell growth on the culture substratum, TCPS. Furthermore, the PFPE polymers supported the attachment and growth of vascular endothelial cells (from human umbilical artery) and human bone-derived cells over a 7 day period at an equal level to TCPS. The relationship between the macromonomer chain length (n = 1 to 4) and the ability of the resulting PFPE homopolymer to support the overgrowth of corneal epithelial tissue was also evaluated. The PFPE-containing polymers supported corneal epithelial tissue overgrowth, with the most effective having a performance equivalent to that of TCPS. Tn addition to these homopolymers, copolymers comprising of PFPE and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) were also synthesised. Surprisingly, the addition of DMAEMA to the PFPE polymer network lead to a reduction in the growth and attachment of corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts. These results indicate that PFPE-based materials show a potential for use in the development of biomaterials in the ocular, vascular and orthopaedic areas.","Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; CSIRO, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; CSIRO, Clayton S MDC, Vic 3169, Australia","Steele, JG (reprint author), Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, POB 184, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia.",jack.steele@riverside.molsci.csiro.au,,"Laycock, Bronwyn/0000-0002-0251-844X",,,,31,15,15,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

However the tissue response associated with this and other polymer implants continues to limit any long-term function. One of the major approaches currently being investigated to improve biocompatibility involves surface modification of the base polymer. In this report, we attempted to alter the healing characteristics of ePTFE by denucleation, a process which removes air trapped within the interstices of the material. Additionally, adsorption of extracellular proteins on the denucleated polymer was also tested. After 5 weeks implanted in subcutaneous and epididymal fat sites of rats, the material was explanted and the healing around the implant evaluated histologically. We found that in skin implants, denucleation alone resulted in a substantial reduction in the fibrous capsule which has been previously reported for untreated ePTFE, and an increase in blood vessel development around and within the polymer. Absorption of extracellular matrix proteins prior to implantation resulted in a reduced vascularity of the implants compared with denucleation-only implants. Implants in fat tissue, regardless of treatment, showed very little tissue reaction, either in the number of inflammatory cells, development of a fibrous capsule or neovascularization. These results suggest that the presence of air nuclei within porous material may contribute to the inappropriate healing response associated with these polymers. In addition, they confirm earlier reports that healing around implanted polymers is tissue-specific.","Arizona Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Surg Res, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA","Boswell, CA (reprint author), Arizona Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Surg Res, POB 245084, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",,,,,,,18,11,11,0,1,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

According to two-dimensional NMR, the backbone structure of this polymer was as expected and contained no byproducts formed by acid catalyzed addition across the fumarate double bond. Kinetic studies of the transesterification showed that the molecular weight reached a final M-n of 4900 (+/-700) and M-w of 9100 (+/-1300) after 16 h, while the polydispersity index remained below 1.8 throughout the reaction.

PHO-cast films were sterilized by either ethylene oxide (EO) gas at 38 degrees C or gamma radiation (2.5 Mrad) in air at room temperature. The physical characteristics of the EO and gamma-sterilized PHO were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile strength analyses. In addition, various analytical methods were used to detect modifications in the chemical and morphological structure of PHO, namely, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The results show that EO sterilization did not modify the chemical and physical characteristics of PHO, however, significant modifications in both the structural and tensile properties were observed with gamma-sterilized PHO. These changes accounted for decreases in both the weight average, number average and melting temperature, and increases in the heat of fusion and tensile strength. No residual EO was detected following sterilization as revealed by head-space chromatography. The physical and structural properties of PHO were shown to be well preserved following EO sterilization, whereas gamma radiation caused random chain scission and physical cross-linking, a frequent phenomenon observed with organic polymers.","Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Montpellier I, Fac Pharm, CRBA, CNRS,URA 1465, Montpellier, France; CHUQ, Ctr Rech, Biomat Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,28,9,9,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Solution-cast PHO films were incubated in a citrate buffer solution with and without acid phosphatase and in an acetate buffer with and without beta-glucuronidase for periods ranging from 7 to GO days. The physical characterization of the PHO films was analyzed by SEM and tensile strength studies. In addition. various analytical methods were used to detect modifications in the chemical and morphological structure of the PHO, namely, ESCA, FTIR, DSC, X-ray diffraction, and SEC. The results indicate that the enzymatic conditions selected in the present study induced no significant surface morphological or chemical modifications, and no significant weight loss was observed after 60 days of incubation. However, as revealed by weight average molecular weight (M) over bar(w) and number average molecular weight (M) over bar(n) decreases, changes in the bulk structure of the PHO were observed with acid phosphatase at 28 and 60 days, in contrast to smaller (M) over bar(w) and (M) over bar(n) decreases recorded in both the buffers and the beta-glucuronidase. The tensile properties had decreased following incubation, yet showed no difference under all of the selected conditions. With no weight loss or surface changes, the PHO films incubated in acid phosphatase showed only a chemical hydrolytic process characterized by (M) over bar(w) and (M) over bar(n) decreases with time of incubation. The present study demonstrated that the degradation of PHO films is one of slow, chemical hydrolysis only, perhaps requiring several months of incubation. The hydrophobic nature of the long alkyl pendent chain in PHO may be responsible for this slow process. The inability of enzymes to degrade PHO may be attributed to the latter's poor adsorption capacity, due to its hydrophobic nature, and to a lack of specificity in the catalytic activity of these enzymes.","Univ Laval, Quebec Biomat Inst, Ctr Rech, CHUQ,Dept Surg,Lab Expt Surg, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Univ Montpellier I, Fac Pharm, CRBA, CNRS,URA 1465, Montpellier, France; Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,,,,28,16,16,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Albumin, fibrinogen, and dimyrstoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were used as model components. The amount of DMPC adsorbed on the MAPC polymers increased with an increase in the MAPC unit composition of the polymer. The methylene chain length of the MAPC unit was another factor influencing the DMPC adsorption when the MAPC unit composition of the MAPC polymer was low. The state of albumin and DMPC liposome adsorbed on the 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer was determined by dynamic contact angle (DCA) measurement. The adsorption strength of albumin on the MPC polymer was weaker than that on the poly[n-butyl methacrylate (BMA)], that is: the albumin was detached from the MPC polymer during the rinsing process. On the poly(BMA) surface, no difference in the shape of the DCA loops before and after contact with the DMPC liposomal suspension was observed. Fibrinogen adsorption on the MAPC polymer was detected by gold-colloid labeled immunoassay. The amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on every MAPC polymer surface was reduced by addition of the DMPC liposome in the fibrinogen solution. The number of platelets adhered on the MAPC polymer was also decreased when the DMPC liposome was present in the fibrinogen solution during pretreatment. We concluded that phospholipids were preferentially adsorbed on the MAPC polymer surface compared with plasma protein and that the adsorbed phospholipids played an important role in showing an excellent blood compatibility on the MAPC polymer.","Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Med & Dent Engn, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; Nihon Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Chem, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018308, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Iwasaki, Y (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Med & Dent Engn, Chiyoda Ku, 2-3-10 Kanda-surugadai, Tokyo 1010062, Japan.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,35,16,16,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

When comparing adhesion to bare polyurethanes, it was found that adhesion was lowest on the phosphonated Pellethane and the the zwitterionic phosphonated polyurethane while highest on the methyl quaternized polyurethanes. Fibrinogen-mediated adhesion was studied by first exposing the polymers to increasing concentrations of canine fibrinogen before incubating them with S. aureus.

Localized perturbations in the chemical potential of water as by, for example, contacting with a solid surface, induces compensating changes in water structure that can be sensed tens of nanometers from the point of origin using the surface force apparatus (SFA) and ancillary techniques. These instruments reveal attractive or repulsive forces between opposing surfaces immersed in water, over-and-above that anticipated by continuum theory (DLVO), that are attributed to a variable density (partial molar volume) of a more-or-less ordered water structure, depending on the water wettability (surface energy) of the water-contacting surfaces. Water structure at surfaces is thus found to be a manifestation of hydrophobicity and, while mechanistic/theoretical interpretation of experimental results remains the subject of some debate in the literature, convergence of experimental observations permit a quantitative definition of the heretofore relative terms 'hydrophobic' and 'hydrophilic'. In particular, long-range attractive forces (< 100 nm) are detected only between surfaces exhibiting a water contact angle theta > 65 deg (defined as hydrophobic surfaces with pure water adhesion tension tau(0) = gamma(0)cos theta < 30 dyn cm(-1) where gamma(0) is water interfacial tension = 72.8 dyn cm(-1)). Short range repulsive forces (< 5 nm) are detected between surfaces exhibiting theta < 65 deg (hydrophilic surfaces, tau(0) > 30 dyn cm(-1)). These findings together with other lines of chemical evidence suggest at least two distinct kinds of water structure and reactivity: a relatively less-dense water region against hydrophobic surfaces with an open hydrogen-bonded network and a relatively more-dense water region against hydrophilic surfaces with a collapsed hydrogen-bonded network. Solvent properties of interfacial water profoundly influence the biological response to materials in a surprisingly straightforward manner when key measures of biological activity sensitive to interfacial phenomenon are scaled against water adhesion tension tau(0) of contacting surfaces. Protein adsorption, activation of blood coagulation, and bioadhesion are offered as examples in point, illustrating that the hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrast in the biological response to materials, often disputed in biomaterials science, is very clear when viewed from the perspective of water structure and reactivity at surfaces.","Becton Dickinson Res Ctr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Vogler, EA (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Steidle Hall, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,95,165,167,1,41,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The polymers are poly[2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-co-n-butyl methacrylate] copolymer (PMB)s with different MPC unit compositions, and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). Surface analysis by dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that the mobility of the polymer chain on the PET substrate depended on the MPC unit composition, but there was no significant difference between the PMBs with 3-10 mol% MPC units and poly(HEMA). Fibronectin adsorption on the polymer surface from a cell culture medium was determined by immunoassay. The adsorbed fibronection was evenly distrubuted in every polymer, however, the amount was reduced with an increase in the MPC unit composition in the PMB. This result suggested that the MPC unit could weaken the interaction between the polymer surface and proteins. When fibroblast L-929 cells, were cultured on the polymers, the cells adhered and the number of cells increased on not only the hydrophobic poly(BMA) but also on the hydrophilic poly(HEMA). However, the number of cells that adhered on the PMB surface decreased with an increase in the MPC unit composition. This was a result of the fibronectin adsorption behavior. Thus, it could be concluded that since the PMB could suppress cell adhesion proteins e.g. fibronectin, the PMB showed excellent cell adhesive resistance properties.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Biomat & Bioengn, Div Organ Mat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010062, Japan","Ishihara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,39,125,127,0,35,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

We have used PEO-polybutadiene-PEO triblock copolymer to graft PEG to biomaterials by gamma-irradiation for a total radiation dose of 1 Mrad. The molecular weight of PEG in the block copolymer was 5000. In vitro study showed that fibrinogen adsorption to Silastic(R) polyethylene, and glass was reduced by 70 similar to 95% by PEO grafting. On the other hand, the reduction of fibrinogen adsorption was only 30% on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE). III vitro platelet adhesion study showed that almost no platelets could adhere to PEG-coated Silastic(R), polyethylene, and glass, while numerous platelet aggregates were found on the ePTFE. The platelet adhesion in vitro corresponded to the fibrinogen adsorption. When the PEG-grafted surfaces were tested ex vivo using a series shunt in a canine model, the effect of the grafted PEG was not noticeable. Platelet deposition on ePTFE was reduced by PEO grafting from 8170 +/- 1030 to 5100 +/- 460 platelets 10(-3) mu m(2), but numerous thrombi were still present on the PEG-grafted surface. The numbers of platelets cumulated on Silastic(R), polyethylene, and glass were 100 +/- 80, 169 +/- 35, and 24 +/- 22 platelets 10(-3) mu m(2) respectively. This is about 35% reduction in platelet deposition by PEO grafting. While the numbers of deposited platelets were small, the decreases were not as large as those expected from the in vitro study. This may be due to a number of reasons which have to be clarified in future studies, but it appears that in vitro platelet adhesion and fibrinogen adsorption studies may not be a valuable predictor for the in vitro or ex vivo behavior of the PEG-grafted surfaces.","Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Park, K (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 39081],,,51,40,40,0,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Whereas most S. aureus clinical isolates elaborate a wide repertoire of bacterial surface 'receptors' called adhesins, exhibiting specific binding of individual host proteins, S. epidermidis is lacking most of such protein adhesins. To document the interactions between, S. epidermidis and various surface-adsorbed proteins, we first compared promotion of bacterial attachment by seven purified human proteins immobilized onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) coverslips. Only two of them, namely fibronectin and fibrinogen, exhibited adhesion-promoting activities. In the presence of native heparin or two functionalized dextrans (CMDBS for Carboxy Methyl, Benzylamide sulfonate/sulfate), a dose-dependent inhibition of S. epidermidis adhesion to fibronectin-coated, but not to fibrinogen-coated surfaces was observed. The inhibitory effects of each CMDBS were much stronger than that of native heparin. In contrast, a control highly negatively charged dextran exclusively substituted with carboxy methyl groups exerted no inhibition on S. epidermidis adhesion. To evaluate how CMDBS could interfere with S. epidermidis attachment to coverslips coated in vivo with extracellular matrix components, we also tested PMMA surfaces retrieved from tissue cages subcutaneously implanted in guinea pigs. Each CMDBS, but not heparin, strongly inhibited S. epidermidis adhesion to explanted coverslips, even in the presence of tissue cage fluid. In conclusion, fibronectin plays an important role in promoting S. epidermidis attachment to implanted biomaterials. Furthermore, S. epidermidis adhesion to fibronectin-coated or implanted biomaterials can be efficiently blocked in vitro by CMDBS.","Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland; Univ Paris 13, Lab Rech Macromol, CNRS UMR 7540, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Francois, P (reprint author), Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland.",,"Didier, letourneur/H-5268-2012","Didier, letourneur/0000-0003-2197-9468",,,,62,12,12,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Methods: a series of aluminium step-wedges were obtained from academic and industrial research laboratories. These were analysed by energy dispersive X-ray procedures. The set of step-wedges were independently characterised for radiopacity at two University dental schools. Results: the percentage of aluminium together with the percentages of minor alloying elements (magnesium, manganese, iron and silicon) have been determined as mass percentages. For each centre, the optical density versus step-height for all wedges was judged to fall on a common curve, with the main exception of one step-wedge that was found to contain 4% copper, by mass. A suitable calculation procedure was described explicitly. Conclusion: of the examined representative step-wedges, all but the aluminium-4% copper material were satisfactory and gave results comparable with wedges of high purity. Limits should therefore be revised for composition of aluminium radiopacity step-wedges or test blocks to a more realistic level of purity. Alloys with more than 0.05% copper or 1.0% iron should be excluded and the aluminium content should be at least 98% by mass. In the calculations deployed for deriving radiopacity as 'equivalent aluminium thicknesses', an appropriate linear regression procedure should be employed and considerable care taken in the evaluation of materials of low or borderline radiopacity, relative to specification limits. The method described is principally suitable for materials with radiopacity greater than 1 mm. For materials with radiopacity less than 1 mm aluminium, thicker specimens (2 mm) should be used.

Total joint replacement of the hip or knee joint has become common treatment; at the same time, an increasing number of fractures are treated with osteosynthesis. The original Charnley low-friction arthroplasty of the hip is still widely used and gives in large series excellent results. Aseptic loosening of this arthroplasty has been thought to be due to wear debris of the methylmethacrylate used for fixation of the implants, or to debris generated from wear of the polyethylene socket. To date, many different materials have been tried in order to reduce wear and generation of macrophage irritating submicron sized particles, or to provide more biocompatible components. However, trials to improve the methylmethacrylate cement or to invent better polyethylenes have often failed. Diamond coating of the metallic components seems promising: there is less wear and diamond is very biocompatible in bulk and small particulate form. Biodegradable implants have also been found useful in treating fractures. Bioactive bioabsorbable materials may also make possible a tissue engineering approach and can be used as carriers for selected drugs and cytokines. Because many promising materials and designs have failed in clinical use, extensive theoretical and experimental testing is mandatory before introducing new materials and implants in a clinical setting.","Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland; Yamagata Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Yamagata 990, Japan; Hosp Nuestra Senora de Gracia, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Zaragoza, Spain; Univ Helsinki, Dept Anat, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland; Natl Agcy Med, Helsinki, Finland","Santavirta, S (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Topeliuksenkatu 5, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland.",Seppo.Santavirta@huch.fi,"GOMEZ-BARRENA, ENRIQUE/A-2799-2008","GOMEZ-BARRENA, ENRIQUE/0000-0003-1065-6137",,,,31,36,36,0,9,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Using this method, it is possible to fix poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels on polymer surfaces, e.g. on catheters, which drastically reduces the friction of these materials. Similarly, other biological relevant properties, especially reduced protein or bacteria adsorption can be achieved by choosing appropriate monomers. The substrate was first homogeneously dip-coated with e.g. the water-insoluble macroinitiator poly(octadecene-co-maleic anhydride), partially reacted to the tert.-butyl perester. Homogeneity, thickness, and reactivity of the macroinitiator layer was characterized in detail. After a temper step, surface homo- and copolymerizations of ionic monomers were carried out in water directly from the modified surface. The consistency of the hydrogel coating could be well controlled by the reaction conditions and the monomer composition. The correlation between the experimental parameters, the composition of the surface coating, and the friction properties was established.

Currently used methods, e.g. bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, show serious disadvantages concerning either sensitivity, specificity or handling. A new enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for the quantification of cell proliferation based on detection of the Ki-67 protein is described. This protein has turned out to be strictly correlated with the active parts of the cell cycle but to be absent in G(0). The measurement of Ki-67 expression by different human cell types, e.g. endothelial cells and HeLa cells, was evaluated in order to answer the question of whether the data obtained using the Ki-67 ELISA method correlate with the proliferation measured with flow cytometrical DNA analysis and microscopical evaluation. Methods currently used for the evaluation of cell proliferation were compared to the new Ki-67 ELISA method. In addition, the functionality of adherent endothelial cells, and the viability and morphology of the cells were investigated. Cells were treated with standard culture medium with or without the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, or growth factors, e.g. endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), and were exposed to metal ion standard solutions. These solutions were in a cytotoxic-non-cytotoxic range. Ki-67 ELISA was found to be a reliable quantitative method to assess proliferation of cultured human cells in vitro. It has advantages over methods that are currently being used. It is easy to perform and corresponds to the requirements for a test to be selected for biomaterial testing according to ISO standard 10 993.

Doubling times for HUVEC on heparin-polypyrrole were greater than observed for gelatin-coated tissue culture polystyrene (44 and 36 h, respectively), however, the cells did proliferate to cover the polymer in an even monolayer. The initial mechanism of attachment and subsequent proliferation of HUVEC on heparin-polypyrrole was critically dependent on the presence of the serum adhesion glycoprotein vitronectin. Polymers that were composed of polypyrrole and sodium nitrate were more hydrophobic than heparin-polypyrrole and they did not support HUVEC growth. Given the relative ease with which these polymer composites can be electrochemically synthesized, the diverse range of cellular ""signal agents"", e.g. growth factors, that can be incorporated within them, and the high degree of control that can be achieved in the release-surface exposure of these agents, we suggest that polypyrrole composites could serve a useful role as ""smart"" biomaterials in the near future.

The Baxter TheraCyte(R) system is a membrane encapsulation system developed for implantation of tissues, cells such as endocrine cells or cell lines genetically engineered for therapeutic peptide delivery in vivo. To demonstrate the utility of this system, cell lines were developed which expressed human growth hormone (hGH) at levels exceeding 1 microgram per million cells per day. These were loaded into devices which were then implanted into juvenile nude rats. Significant levels of hGH of up to 2.5 ng/ml were detected in plasma throughout the six month duration of the study. In contrast, animals implanted with free cells showed peak plasma levels of 0.5 to 1.2 ng four days after implantation with no detectable hGH beyond 10 days. Histological examination of explanted devices showed they were vascularized and contained cells that were viable and morphologically healthy. After removal of the implants, no hGH could be detected which confirmed that the source of hGH was from cells contained within the device. The long term expression of human growth hormone as a model peptide has implications for the peptide therapies for a variety of human diseases using membrane encapsulated cells.","Baxter Healthcare Corp, Gene Therapy Unit, Round Lake, IL 60073 USA","Josephs, SF (reprint author), Baxter Healthcare Corp, Gene Therapy Unit, WG2-3S,Route 120 & Wilson Rd, Round Lake, IL 60073 USA.",,,,,,,22,25,25,0,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0946-2716,,,J MOL MED-JMM,J.

Design: Laboratory investigation using a polyvinylchloride pipe periarticular tibia fracture model. Setting: Simulated periarticular tibia fractures were created in a tibia model. Instrumented specimens were tested in a biomaterials resting system. Intervention: Groups of simulated periarticular tibia fractures were stabilized with one of nine different external fixation constructs with components from one manufacturer. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness was measured for each specimen in compression, torsion, flexion bending, extension bending, and varus and valgus bending. Results: The four-ring Ilizarov fixator was the stiffest in all modes of testing. There was a trend toward increasing stiffness with an increasing number of rings. Fixators constructed with multiple levels of fixation in the periarticular fragment were stiffer in all modes of testing, The additional spacing between wires gained by the use of a single thick carbon ring or the use of a drop wire three centimeters from a single ring did not increase stiffness in this model. Frame modifications intended to augment the bar-to-ring connection did not increase stiffness. The use of rings mounted with half-pins instead of a unilateral bar mounted with half-pins for diaphyseal fixation increased the stiffness of the frame only in torsional testing. Conclusions: Although the ideal stiffness of an external fixator is unknown, our results show that the addition of more than one level of fixation in the periarticular fragment increases the stiffness of hybrid external fixators in this periarticular tibia fracture model. Augmentation of the ring-to-bar connection did not significantly affect the stiffness of the Frame.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, Lexington, KY 40536 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Nashville, TN USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Rehabil, Nashville, TN USA","Pugh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, 740 S Limestone, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",,,,,,,22,27,29,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0890-5339,,,J ORTHOP TRAUMA,J.

The microparticles have been characterized with regard to their surface properties, morphology, and size. Thus, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis data and results of Zeta potential measurements suggest that the polyamino acid side chains tend to concentrate at the surface of the particles. Also, analyses by environmental scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy indicate that particles carrying poly(lysine) chains have an unusual porous structure, most probably due to the combined effects of the amphiphilic, polyelectrolyte, and chemical nature of the composing copolymer, as well as of the particular preparation technique employed. The capabilities of the microparticles to serve as carriers in controlled drug release and delivery devices were demonstrated by encapsulation and release of rhodamine B, a low molecular weight drug model.","MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Parma, Dipartimento Farmaceut, I-43100 Parma, Italy; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Langer, R (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, E25-342, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rlanger@mit.edu,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014; colombo, Paolo/I-3063-2012","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771; ",NIGMS NIH HHS [GM 26698],,,26,31,38,3,28,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037 USA",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

Study Design/Materials and Methods: A film solder consisted of a white layer (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and distilled water) and a black layer (BSA, carbon black (CB), and distilled water). This two-layer solder was used with a diode laser to weld sections of dog small intestine (lambda = 810 nm, power = 200 +/- 20 mW, radiation dose = 18 +/- 1 J/mg). Sections of intestine were welded only with one-layer black solders as control group. The temperature difference between the external solder surface and the tissue-solder interface was evaluated during welding. Results: The two-layer solder performed welds as strong as the one-layer solder (similar to 0.12 N) but with less laser intensity on the black layer. The temperature difference between the external surface of the solder and the solder-tissue interface was significantly less for the two-layer solder than for the one-layer solder (similar to 6 degrees C and similar to 15 degrees C, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The two-layer solder appeared to be more efficient at soldering biomaterials than the one-layer solder. Furthermore, the heat diffusion from the black midplane of the two-layer solder decreased the difference in temperature recorded on the solder external surface and on the solder-tissue interface.

The specific variation of the material composition represents one option to affect the surface properties and to investigate their influence at biocompatibility. In the present study such a synthesis variation of ceramic biomaterials within the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 was examined since by varying the material composition the surface energy can be varied and thus adapted to the requirements of the biosystem respectively the test cells. That's why for the planned in-vitro investigations ceramics on the basis of the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 with variable composition and sufficient densities were developed by means of soi-gel techniques. It could be demonstrated that the surface energy respectively the surface enthalpy can be affected by a variable material composition. In this context the silicon oxide seems to be of special importance. Thus it could be shown that if the concentration of silicon oxide increases surface tension and polarity of the examined material surface increases too. Although the realized in-vitro tests confirm a good biocompatibility of the involved ceramics concerning cell proliferation and metabolic activity a significant correlation between surface properties and the observed cellular response could not be detected. Probably this result is ascribable only to the comparatively small parameter variations which were achieved by varying the material composition. A direct correlation between the cell behavior and the composition of the investigated materials based on the interface energy concept could not be proved for the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 in the present study.,"Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, FB Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heiligenstadt, Germany; Univ Jena, Tech Inst, Lehrstuhl Mat Wissensch, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Frant, M (reprint author), Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, FB Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

With the small amount of chloride ion, this alloy did not show pitting corrosion on the polarization curve. Open-circuit potential which was always lower than pitting potential was ennobled with the decrease of pH The pitting potential was considerably ennobled by the dissolved oxygen because of the decrease of hydroxide ion and phosphate ion in the surface oxide. On the other hand, the extra oxygen retained nickel oxide in the surface film, causing the slight decrease of pitting potential. When titanium, niobium, indium, and tungsten were employed as M, the pitting potential of the Zr60M5Al7.5Cu27.5 amorphous alloys largely increased with the dissolved oxygen.

The animals were killed and their eyes collected for histopathology. Of 37 eyes, 26 that were implanted for 111 to 455 days were selected for the study. Results: In 26 eyes, scleral buckling was visible. Scleral examination showed a regular erosion under the buckle, mainly with silicone. All explants were surrounded by a fibrous capsule, which was smooth and regular with silicone. With hydrogel, fragmentation was observed with a giant cell reaction. Capsule thickness increased, mainly with hydrogel. Conclusion: Fragmentation affected segmental or circumferential hydrogel explants. As in silicone explants, the capsule surface was normal when the hydrogel surface was respected. The fragmentation mechanism remains unclear.","Hotel Dieu, Dept Ophthalmol, Paris, France; Hop Bichat, Dept Ophthalmol, Paris, France","D'Hermies, F (reprint author), Hop Hotel Dieu, Ophthalm Pathol Lab, 1 Pl Parvis Notre Dame, F-75181 Paris 04, France.",,,,,,,19,6,6,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0275-004X,,,RETINA-J RET VIT DIS,Retin.-J.

For example, speckles generated by illuminating soft biological tissue with laser light are subject to rapid decorrelation due to the Brownian movement of water and scattering particles in the tissues and to cellular motions. In addition, the penetration of the laser beam into the tissue or translucent biomaterial results in multiple scattering and a complete depolarization of the speckle field. This may complicate the evaluation of the strain field when a force is applied to the material because the speckle pattern shift is providing information from the surface of the material as well as from the bulk sample, where the strains may or may not be the same as on the surface. This paper presents a variation of a speckle processing scheme originally called the 'Transform Method' for evaluating both surface and bulk strain rates and total strains in biological tissues and translucent biomaterials. The method is not a correlation based technique, but instead relies upon two-dimensional frequency transforms of time series of one-dimensional speckle pattern records stacked into two dimensional arrays. The method is insensitive to speckle field depolarization and, compared to correlation-based techniques, is relatively insensitive to speckle decorrelation. Strain rates and total in-plane strains were measured in both hard (cortical bone) and soft (artery segments) biological tissues and in translucent biomaterials (dental ceramics), Potential applications to medical diagnostics and biomaterials science are also discussed.","Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Biomat & Biomech, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3200-8,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3726,,,,,,504,511,,10.1117/12.341432,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics",Materials Science; Mechanics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics,BM94U,WOS:000080215700063,,,,,2019-02-25

The high lateral resolution is the result of a sudden increase in reflectivity when the tip goes close to the surface at about 50 % vibration damping. This technique has been tested for samples of practical importance in the field of organic colourants and for Raman spectroscopy. In the first example the radial distributions of different disperse dyes within polyester fibers have been studied. SNOM measurements on cross-sections of coloured fibers allow separating the fluorescence signal of the dyes out of the total internal reflection signal with appropriate filters. The fluorescence SNOM images allow to quantify the penetration (diffusion) of the dye into the fibers. Ring-dyed and uniformly dyed fibers can easily be distinguished. Local photobleaching of fluorescence is demonstrated. Topographic and optical images correspond precisely both in mu m scale and in nm scale scans. In the second example fluorescent nanoparticles (100 - 200 nm diameter) embedded in thin films of polyvidone were studied by SNOM and AFM. The optical images provide single spherical particles (of correct size) as well as larger aggregates. The emerging topographies are 10 nm wider than the fluorescence SNOM images which allows to estimate a 5 nm coverage of the resin. In the third example local Raman SNOM spectra of scratched Si and its SiO2 cover, as well as of GaN were measured with an optoacoustic single photon counting spectrometer at 488 nm excitation in collection times of 10 min. Possible applications to biomaterials are discussed.","Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany","Kaupp, G (reprint author), Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",,,,,,,13,7,7,0,8,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3077-3,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3607,,,,,,16,25,,10.1117/12.350632,,,,10,Medical Laboratory Technology; Microscopy; Optics,Medical Laboratory Technology; Microscopy; Optics,BN29F,WOS:000081436700003,,,,,2019-02-25

As a passivating treatment, electropolishing (EP) was demonstrated to decrease the amount of nickel on the surface and to remarkably improve the corrosion behavior of the alloy. After sterilization by ethylene oxide (EO), no modification of the promising corrosion behavior of electropolished NiTi were observed, although some surface modifications were reported.

These biocompatible protective layers have been deposited on various metallic (stainless steel, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys) and polymeric (polyethylene) substrates. Residual stress in deposited materials may lead to distortion of the crystal lattice, cracks in the film, or delamination of the film. Residual stresses consist of thermal stresses, which are induced at temperatures other than the deposition temperature if the coating and substrate have different thermal expansion coefficients, lattice-misfit stresses, which occur during epitaxial growth due to lattice parameter misfit, and surface-tension stresses, which arise when force fields are created by the surface tension between islands of deposits grown from substrate sites favorable for precipitation. Adhesion, fretting, adhesive wear, and hence abrasive (third-body) wear of diamond and diamondlike carbon films can be minimized by reducing local stress levels and increasing atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region. This review discusses schemes to reduce local film stress levels and increase atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region for diamond and diamondlike carbon coatings on metallic substrates and diamondlike carbon coatings on polyethylene. The hardness of diamondlike carbon films has been continuously varied by doping these films with silver and titanium. We have also created diamond/titanium carbide and diamond/aluminum nitride composites, in which the amount of sp(3)-bonded carbon increases with film thickness. We have also created enhanced film adhesion and wear via these functionally graded firms. Thus, by reducing local stress levels and increasing atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region, we can improve adhesion and wear of diamondlike carbon and diamond coatings for biomaterials.","Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Narayan, RJ (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",,"Narayan, Roger/J-2789-2013; Narayan, Jagdish/D-1874-2009","Narayan, Roger/0000-0002-4876-9869; ",,,,10,0,0,0,4,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-427-5,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,355,365,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Coatings & Films",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM95J,WOS:000080238600032,,,,,2019-02-25

Successful production of BMPs through recombinant DNA technology provides an opportunity to constitute new artificial implants with bone-inducing capacity by combining with synthetic implants. To build these bioactive implants, degradable polymer materials were synthesized, mixed with BMP and screened for their capacity to induce bone in an in vivo system. Implants consisting of polylactic acid (PLA) polymers and its derivative polymers with liquid and plastic properties in combination with rBMP consistently induced new bone in mice within a few weeks after implantation. Our data and the work of others suggest that these reconstituted bone-inducing materials have the potential to substitute bone grafts in the healing of fractures or repair of bone defects. The combination of this hybrid material with porous solid biomaterials could provide a bone-inducing implant with mechanical strength. Further preclinical and clinical work to check the safety of these implants will be necessary before they are adopted for widespread clinical use.","Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Takaoka, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Asahi 3-1-1, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0531-5131,,0-444-50029-4,INT CONGR SER,,,1999.0,1175,,,,,,141,151,,,,,,11,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Materials Science,BN11S,WOS:000080759400015,,,,,2019-02-25

Cell culture technology allows to expand keratinocytes up to 6000-fold in vitro after taking a single biopsy from patient. Today the transplantation of these in vitro cultured keratinocytes in different modifications is an established clinical treatment regimen for therapy of extensive wounds. For example, keratinocyte-fibrin-glue-suspensions, mainly consisting of proliferative epidermal basal cells, were used for the treatment of burns in experimental and clinical settings to bypass the disadvantages of conventional sheet grafts. Other approaches in tissue engineering for wound healing aim at the (epi-)dermal repair by the combination of allodermis and biomaterials, i.e. collagen-sponges and microspheres. Due to most recent efforts in keratinocyte culture techniques, developments in tissue engineering, research for novel biomaterials and gene therapy, therapy of chronic wounds may prove to be more efficient.

It is therefore desirable to provide a crosslinking reagent that is of low cytotoxicty and can form stable and biocompatible crosslinked products. To achieve this goal, a naturally occurring crosslinking reagent-genipin-was used by our group to fix biological tissues. Genipin can be obtained from its parent compound geniposide, which can be isolated from the fruits of Gardenia jasminoides ELLIS. In our previous feasibility study, it was found that the cytotoxicity of genipin is significantly lower than both glutaraldehyde and an epoxy compound. Additionally it was shown that genipin can form stable crosslinked products. The present study further investigates the biocompatibility of a genipin-fixed porcine pericardium implanted subcutaneously in a growing rat model. The fresh, glutaraldehyde-, and epoxy-fixed counterparts were used as controls. It was noted that the inflammatory reaction of the genipin-fixed tissue was significantly less than its glutaraldehyde- and epoxy-fixed counterparts. Also, the genipin-fixed tissue has tensile strength and resistance against in vivo degradation comparable to the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue. Additionally, the calcium content of the genipin-fixed tissue measured throughout the entire course of the study was minimal. Nevertheless, further study in calcification for the genipin-fixed tissue should be conducted in a blood-contact environment. The results obtained in this subcutaneous study indicate that genipin is a promising crosslinking reagent for biological tissue fixation. However, further durability testing in vitro and in vivo are needed to determine the relative functional merits of this new crosslinker.

Activated platelets and platelet-derived microparticles are known to dramatically enhance the catalytic efficiencies of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes. In this paper, a modified Russell viper venom coagulation time test is used to quantitate material-induced procoagulant activity due to the generation of activated phospholipid surfaces. In our test system, polyethylene and Silastic(TM) tubes were filled with heparinized whole blood and left to gently flow back and forth at 37 degrees C. After 1 h, the blood within the tubes was gravity drained and the plasma fraction assayed for procoagulant activity. The clotting times were determined by a Coag-A-Mate X2 instrument after the automated addition of Russell viper venom (to activate factors V and X) and calcium ions. Appreciable procoagulant activity was generated during whole blood contact within polyethylene and Silastic(TM) tubes although significantly greater activity was generated by the latter surface. As previously reported, platelet-derived microparticles also were detected by flow cytometry. Filtration of the plasma after material contact through a 0.1 mu m filter led to substantial gains in clotting times and to near complete removal of microparticles, indicating that the material-induced microparticles likely were responsible for the procoagulant activity.

In a previous in vitro study we demonstrated that a collagen sponge constituted of type I collagen fibrils, chondroitin sulfates, and hydroxyapatite crystals induces an earlier and a more abundant synthesis of a new extracellular calcifying matrix than do other biomaterials such as collagen or hydroxyapatite alone. Bone mineral contains various amounts of magnesium ions, either adsorbed at the surface of apatite crystals or incorporated inside the crystal structure. Magnesium is known to reduce the degradation rate of tricalcium phosphate ceramics and to influence the crystallization of mineral substance. Thus we evaluated two sponges modified with different substituted apatites. The substituted low magnesium-containing apatite sample decreased the osteoinductive properties of the sponge whereas the substituted high magnesium-containing apatite sample had a toxic effect on bone cells and prevented the formation of any extracellular matrix. Such a toxic effect can be explained by the presence of large numbers of magnesium ions released into the culture medium even though at physiological level magnesium is able to promote bone mineralization and to control the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals. Thus collagen sponges containing hydroxyapatite remain one of the most appropriately evaluated biomaterials used for the restoration of periodontal pockets and bone defects.

The relative emission intensity between both components strongly depends on the magnitude of the fluence and so do their velocities of expansion. Spectra as recorded have shown that at low fluences, molecular species predominate over atomic ones, whereas at high fluences, atomic species are the predominant ones. Images obtained with the aid of bandpass filters have revealed that the nature of the faster emissive component in the plume is mainly atomic, whereas emission from the second one mainly arises from excited molecular radicals.

After 3, 8, 12, and 24 weeks of implantation, histological investigation and histomorphometry were performed on undecalcified samples. Our results show that spontaneous bone healing in the empty cavities is significantly different (p < 0.05) between cortical (SBH > 80%) and cancellous bone sites (SBH < 31%) and that no new bone is formed in marrow tissue. For both porous ceramics, the highest osteogenesis was obtained in the cortical site. Osteogenesis was intermediate in the cancellous site and weak in the medullar site. The material biodegradation was the strongest in the medullar site and higher in the cancellous site than in the cortical site. Both activities were better in the beta-TCP than in the HA (p > 0.05). The marrow tissue presents a foreign-body reaction more reliable, sensitive, and durable than other bone tissues. Therefore, the cancellous bone site is a good site for evaluation of the biofunctionality of biomaterials because of the equilibrium of the osteogenesis and the biodegradation activities, but marrow tissue seems to be better for testing material biocompatibility in vivo.

The long-term follow-up (up to 78 weeks) indicated: (1) BCr and COMP induced a foreign-body inflammatory reaction but without fibrous encapsulation Phagocytosis was mediated by mononucleated macrophages (MC) and giant multinucleated cells (GMNC). Phagocytosis was stronger with COMP and required the recruitment of GMNC while it primarily involved MC in the case of BCP. (2) There appeared to be no significant difference between the bone ingrowth in the defects packed with BCP (dBCP) and in those filled with COMP (dCOMP). Bone reconstruction mostly was achieved after 4 weeks in dBCP but took more time to reach the center of dCOMP. High bone remodeling was observed at the last, evaluation times, especially in the case of COMP. (3) Degradation of the materials occurred mainly during the first 4 weeks and was more severe for COMP, which probably was related to the smaller granulometry of its mineral phase. Cell-mediated degradation went on for the 78 weeks and followed two processes: phagocytosis and/or extracellular dissolution of the calcium phosphate particles.

However, processing techniques utilized to fabricate these matrices typically involve organic solvents and/or high temperatures. Here we describe a process for fabricating matrices without the use of organic solvents and/or elevated temperatures. Disks comprised of polymer [e.g., poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)] and NaCl particles were compression molded at room temperature and subsequently allowed to equilibrate with high pressure CO2 gas (800 psi). Creation of a thermodynamic instability led to the nucleation and growth of gas pores in the polymer particles, resulting in the expansion of the polymer particles. The polymer particles fused to form a continuous matrix with entrapped salt particles. The NaCl particles subsequently were leached to yield macropores within the polymer matrix. The overall porosity and level of pore connectivity were regulated by the ratio of polymer/salt particles and the size of salt particles. Both the compressive modulus (159 +/- 130 kPa versus 289 +/- 25 kPa) and the tensile modulus (334 +/- 52 kPa versus 1100 +/- 236 kPa) of the matrices formed with this approach were significantly greater than those formed with a standard solvent casting/particulate leaching process. The utility of these matrices was demonstrated by engineering smooth muscle tissue in vitro with them. This novel process, a combination of high pressure gas foaming and particulate leaching techniques, allows one to fabricate matrices with a well controlled porosity and pore structure. This process avoids the potential negatives associated with the use of high temperatures and/or organic solvents in biomaterials processing.

Hydrolysis of PGA in 1N NaOH transformed ester groups on the surface of PGA fibers to carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups. After hydrolysis, the polymer scaffold retained its original gross appearance and dimensions while the fiber diameter decreased. A plot of fiber diameter versus the hydrolysis time showed a linear relationship, with a rate of decrease in fiber diameter of 0.65 mu m/min. The molecular weight and thermal properties of the polymer did not change significantly following surface hydrolysis. In cell seeding experiments, surface-hydrolyzed mesh was seeded with more than twice as many cells as unmodified PGA mesh. Vascular smooth muscle cells attached to the surface-hydrolyzed PGA mesh both as individual cells and as cell aggregates while only cell aggregates were observed on the unmodified mesh. Control experiments indicated that adsorption of serum proteins onto the surface-hydrolyzed PGA fibers was correlated with the increase in cell seeding density. These results demonstrate that optimization of biomaterial-cell interactions provides a strategy for increasing the initial cell seeding density for the engineering of tissues of high cell density.

When they enter blood vessels some of them are carried by proteins like albumin and can be taken up by endothelial cells lining the vessels. To study their involvement in the inflammatory response we investigated heavy metal ion induced effects in cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). NiCl2 and CoCl2 upregulate, especially in concentrations of 1 mM, the expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1), as well as the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, as shown by enzyme immunoassay and Northern blot analysis. In addition, possible signal transduction mechanisms were elucidated. The HUVECs were treated with various selective inhibitory drugs followed by the incubation of metal ions before measuring the expression of the above-mentioned endothelial factors. Two protein kinase inhibitors (H-7 and H-8) strongly repressed Ni2+ and Co2+ enhanced expression, as did the phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine. Other selective inhibitors of protein kinases C or A, or cGMP-dependent protein kinases, as well as calcium antagonists like 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethan-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzosaure 8-(diethylamino)-octylester and inhibitors of receptor mediated endocytosis (primary amines), had no influence. We showed that NiCl2 and CoCl2 activate the translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B into the cell nucleus and enhance its binding to a NF-kappa B consensus sequence as shown by mobility shift analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the activation of AP-1. Despite the repression of heavy metal induced adhesion molecule synthesis, we did not detect any inhibition of NF-kappa B translocation by H-7 or H-8. Therefore, it must be concluded that heavy metal ions like Ni2+ and Co2+ activate two or more signal transduction pathways in endothelial cells. We clearly showed that there is one pathway in which H-7 and H-8 sensitive protein kinases are involved and a second pathway leading to NF-kappa B activation, which is insensitive to H-7 and H-8. Our results demonstrate that heavy metal ions induce mechanisms of gene activation in endothelial cells as do proinflammatory mediators, indicating that corroding metal ion containing biomaterials can provoke inflammatory reactions by known, as well as by yet unknown, intracellular signaling pathways.

Despite the undisputed advantages of the polypropylene (PP) meshes currently available (Marlex(R), Prolene(R)), reports of complications after implantation are increasing. Although, serious complications such as perforation and fistula formation are rare, minor and local complaints such as seromas, misfeelings and a decreased abdominal wall mobility are observed in about one-half of the patients. In regard to the exaggerated strength of the currently available mesh modifications a reduction of the material should improve the integration of the meshes into the artificial abdominal wall. In the present study, the commercially available basic mesh Prolene(R) has been compared to two newly constructed PP-mesh modifications with reduced amounts of PP. The modifications have gradually been adopted to the physiological requirements of abdominal wall stability and mobility by reducing the amount of PP to 64% (E-BLUE) and 24% (variant A) of the Prolene(R) mesh (developed by ETHICON(R), Norderstedt, Germany). All PP-mesh variants have been implanted in a rat model and studied by 3D-photogrammetry, tensiometry, light- and electron microscopy, as well as morphometry over implantation intervals of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days. The data show that current constructions of PP-meshes are oversized and definitely restrict abdominal wall mobility in the present model. Sufficient stability of the artificial abdominal wall is even guaranteed by PP-mesh modifications with a reduction of PP-quantity to about 25% of the Prolene(R) mesh. The degree of fibrosis directly correlated with abdominal wall restriction, whereas the formation of connective tissue in the interface PP-fibre/host-issue depends on the amount and activity of the inflammatory reaction. The quantity and quality of inflammation, again, directly relies to the amount of PP and to the surface area in contact with the recipient tissues. Altogether, the present study suggests that a modification of the PP-meshes could be helpful to prevent major and minor complications of surgical PP-meshes.

Nevertheless, the behaviour of these materials, and in particular, the mechanisms guiding their interface response in physiological environment is still unknown. This work describes the construction of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate electrodes used to determine the interface potential behaviour of these materials in a simulated body fluid, in a pH range corresponding to the Variation observed in human body injuries, at ambient and physiological temperatures. These measurements are associated with the adsorption/desorption of ions from the materials. The results show that hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate have similar behaviour in that they reach an interface potential equilibrium state faster when the solution pH is decreased and the temperature increased. This behaviour may be attributed to their ability to form a calcium-rich layer and is relevant to their quality as implantable materials. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The drawn samples have been characterized by mechanical tests, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The Young's modulus, E, and the stress at break, sigma(b), increase linearly with the draw ratio and reach values which are about five times those characteristic of undrawn samples. Furthermore, on stretching the alignment of the gelatin strands along the direction of deformation increases while the thickness of the layers decreases significantly. The renaturation level, that is the fraction of gelatin in a collagen-like structure, has been calculated as the ratio between the melting enthalpy of gelatin samples and that of tendon collagen. The results indicate that the improvement of mechanical properties achieved by drawn gelatin is closely related to the renaturation level. The experimental approach utilized to induce segmental orientation in gelatin films, allows to obtain anisotropic materials with improved mechanical properties in the direction of deformation, and can be usefully applied in the preparation of biomaterials.

This polymer can be classified as an alternating copolymer of succinic acid and desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine hexyl ester (DTH), a diphenolic monomer derived from the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. In this study, the effects of water uptake (hydration) on the secondary relaxations of poly(DTH succinate) were investigated using the technique of thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TDSC). Four relaxation peaks were precisely characterized by means of Gaussian activation energy distributions. Drying and rehydration treatments show that only small amounts of water, at most 0.5% (w/w), are necessary to hydrate two of the four polar moieties in poly(DTH succinate): the pendent chain ester carbonyls and the amide carbonyls in the polymer backbone. Water appeared to be more tightly bound to the amide carbonyl group and more loosely bound to the ester carbonyl group in the pendent chain. Even at a high state of hydration (1.2% w/w), TDSC indicated that no water was associated with the phenyl ester bond in the polymer backbone. This finding may explain the unexpectedly high stability of this polymer toward hydrolysis under physiological conditions. Polymer packing was also affected by hydration. In an intermediate hydration state (water content: 0.5% w/w) polymer packing was less dense than in the wet state (water content: 1.2% w/w). This study represents the first application of the TDSC technique to the study of hydration in a degradable biomedical polymer. The results obtained indicate that the TDSC technique may be useful to assist in the understanding of the mechanisms of hydration and subsequent hydrolytic degradation in degradable biomaterials.

Cell culture polystyrene (PS) was used as a reference, Cell numbers and cell viability were used as parameters of proliferation. Cell differentiation was assessed using alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen I and osteocalcin production. The parameters of proliferation showed earlier maximum values on PS and cpTi, while proliferation was delayed on SS and CrCoMb. The highest values of differentiation were found on cpTi. The development of alkaline phosphatase activity showed tao peaks reflecting apoptosis and redifferentiation. The cell culture system hFOB 1.19 is thus suitable for revealing differences in proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts on standard orthopaedic materials. The results correlate with previous in vivo findings. Using this system, the dynamic effect of the material surface on the differentiation process of osteoblasts can be demonstrated.","Univ Wurzburg, Orthopad Klin, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Expt Zahnheilkunde, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; Univ Wurzburg, Klin Forschergrp Med Poliklin, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Merklein, F (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Orthopad Klin, Konig Ludwig Haus,Brettreichstr 11, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",,,,,,,17,15,15,0,2,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

Materials and methods Collagen sponges were exposed to a continuous flow of urine at pH 5.3 and 6.3 for 1 week, The sponges were examined microscopically for crystal deposition and analysed for their calcium content. Two cell lines, RT112, derived from a well-differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, and UROtsa, an immortalized urothelial cell line, were seeded on the collagen sponges. Cells were cultured for 6, 12 and 21 days. The pattern of growth was analysed by histology and immunostaining with a pan-cytokeratin antibody. Growth was assayed to quantify cell proliferation on the sponges, Results No crystals were evident on any of the collagen sponges. Calcium deposition was negligible at pH 5,3. Although calcium levels were measurable at pH 6,3, the levels were very low, Both cell lines attached and grew in a stratified manner on the collagen sponge, RT112 forming a layer 6-8 cells thick, and UROtsa a layer 4-6 cells thick; cell proliferation was maximal at 5-10 days. The sponge remained easy to handle after 3 weeks in culture, Conclusion These findings show that collagen sponges support the growth and stratification of urothelial cells, and indicate that the collagen sponge is a suitable substrate for developing urothelial autologous grafts.","UCL, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, London W1P 7LD, England; UCL, Inst Urol, London W1P 7LD, England; Inst Biol & Chim & Prot, Lyon, France","Sabbagh, W (reprint author), UCL, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 67-73 Riding House St, London W1P 7LD, England.",,"Masters, John/C-5694-2011",,,,,35,20,20,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0007-1331,,,BRIT J UROL,Br.

A limitation of some proteins is their biologically imposed symmetry, which results in indistinguishable recognition surfaces. Here, we have explored methods for modifying the symmetry of an oligomeric protein that exhibits useful self-assembly properties. Results: Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (GS) contains 24 solvent-exposed histidines on two symmetry-related surfaces. These histidines drive a metal-dependent self-assembly of GS tubes. Immobilization of GS on the affinity resin Ni2+-NTA followed by on-column modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate affords asymmetrically modified GS that self-assembles only to the extent of 'short' dimeric GS tubes, as demonstrated by electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. The utility of Ni2+-NTA as a chemical mask was also demonstrated for asymmetric modification of engineered cysteines adjacent to the natural histidines. Conclusions: Current genetic methods do not provide distinguishable recognition elements on symmetry-related surfaces of biologically assembled proteins. Ni2+-NTA serves as a mask to control chemical modification in vitro of residues within symmetry-related pairs, on proteins containing functional His-tags. This strategy may be extended to modification of a wide range of amino acids with a myriad of reagents.","Univ Washington, Dept Med Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Atkins, WM (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Med Chem, Box 357610, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",winky@u.washington.edu,"Chin, Wei-Chun/A-6068-2008","Chin, Wei-Chun/0000-0003-4881-9085",,,,29,6,6,1,3,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",1074-5521,1879-1301,,CHEM BIOL,Chem.

Several biomaterials are available for the purpose of soft tissue augmentation, but none of them has all the properties of the ideal filler material. The recent development of hyaluronic acid gels for dermal implantation give the physician neu, possibilities of effective treatment in this field. OBJECTIVE. This study provides a clinical and histological evaluation of safety and efficacy of a cross-linked stabilized nonanimal hyaluronic acid gel (Restylane, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) to determine its characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and side-effects. METHODS. 158 patients were treated with facial intradermal implant of hyaluronic acid gel for augmentation therapy of wrinkles and folks, and for lip augmentation and/or recontouring. The results were evaluated in all patients by subjective judgement by the physician aim the patient, and by photographic method at time 0 and after 1, 2, 4 and 8 months from the procedure. In addition, a smaller histological study was carried out in five volunteer patients for a term of 52 weeks to determine the interaction and duration of the material ill human healthy skin. RESULTS. Clinically, both the physicians' and patients' evaluations revealed very satisfactory results, with a global 78.5% and 73.4% respectively of moderate or marked improvement after Eight months, independent of the treated area. The photographic evaluation revealed even better results with a 80.4% of moderate or marked improvement after 8 months. The safety evaluation showed a 12.5% of postoperative immediate adverse events, that were localized and transient. There was no evidence of major systemic sine effects. Histologically, the product was shown to be long-lasting and well tolerated as judged by histological techniques. CONCLUSIONS. Stabilized, non-animal, hyaluronic acid gel is well tolerated and effective in augmentation therapy of soft tissues of the face. This material presents several advantages in comparison to previously used injectable biomaterials and expands the arsenal of therapeutic tools in the field of soft tissue augmentation.

The maximum principal tensile stress during phase change increases with a decrease in boundary temperature (faster cooling). This is consistent with experimentally observed fractures at a lower boundary temperature. Large volumetric expansion during water to ice transformation was shown to be the primary contributor to large stress development.

The method simultaneously measures the resonant frequency, f, and the dissipation energy, D, of the oscillating system. The QCM responses are sensitive to very small amounts (a few hundreds) of cells and highly specific to surface chemical properties. The first results from deposition of cells on two polystyrene surfaces of different wettability in serum-containing medium are reported. It has previously been shown that a decrease in fis related to the deg ree of cell spreading. In our data it appears that the extent or quality of cell attachment is reflected in an increase in D caused by adhering cells. The combined information from f and D measured by this technique might therefore be useful to probe cell-surface interactions for biomaterials.

Large-scale progressive changes in the composition of the resultant polymeric films were observed with sequential changes in the plasma duty cycle employed during polymerization, all other plasma variables held constant. The film compositional changes obtained are in the direction of increased retention of the lactam ring of the monomer in the resultant polymers as the duty cycles employed (i.e., the ratio of plasma on to plasma off times) were decreased. Particularly significant are the relatively linear polymeric structures obtained under the exceptionally low-average power deposition conditions made accessible with the pulsed plasma technique. XPS and FTIR spectroscopic examination of these latter films reveal compositions that are similar to those obtained by conventional(i.e., nonplasma) synthesis of the linear polymer. The film chemistry controllability demonstrated in the present study is achieved while maintaining the many advantages of the plasma polymerization approach for surface modifications. This work provides additional support for use of the pulsed operational mode as an effective means of film chemistry control, in particular extending the plasma polymerization technique to include synthesis of linear polymers, in Lieu of the more highly crosslinked structures typically produced in conventional continuous-wave plasma polymerization processes.

The granules and the titanium alloy were closed, and a reactive layer was formed at the interface between both of them. The implantation process of granules is divided in the following two steps. (I) First, the granules are implanted in the depth which is corresponding to the diameter with small stress.

Unmodified (control) or aminosugar-containing (glucosamines or N-acetyl-glucosamines) hydrogels were implanted immediately or ten days after the lesions. Six months later, brain sections were processed for cresyl-violet, acetylcholinesterase, and immunocytochemical (glial fibrillary acidic protein, protein S100, neurofilaments, laminin, fibronectin) staining. All hydrogels were well integrated in the brain, constituting a stable bridge between the septum and the hippocampus. Weak gliosis occasionally surrounded the hydrogel in rats from the immediate-implantation group, whereas a more pronounced gliosis was observed in those from the delayed-implantation group. The hydrogels contained blood vessels and were invaded by host cells including astrocytes. Astrocytes formed a loose tissue network filling the porous structure of the hydrogels. Within the hydrogels, laminin-, fibronectin- or neurofilaments-immunopositive networks were also observed. Moreover, numerous acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers penetrated into the hydrogels from the septal, cortical and striatal areas. Fibre penetration was most important in the N-acetylglucosamines-containing hydrogels. Despite these features, the hippocampus failed to show any increase of acetylcholinesterase-staining as compared to that seen in lesion-only rats. These results confirm the regeneration capacity of severed septohippocampal neurons into polymeric substrates used as a bridge inserted in a fimbria-fomix lesion cavity. As such, biomaterials might be of clinical interest not only in the case of spinal cord sections, but also in cases of brain trauma.","Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7521, LN2C, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; Organogel Canada Ltee, Quebec City, PQ G1P 4R7, Canada","Cassel, JC (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7521, LN2C, 12 Rue Goethe, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",jean-christophe.cassel@psycho-ulp.u-strasbg.fr,,,,,,75,22,22,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0922-6028,1878-3627,,RESTOR NEUROL NEUROS,Restor.

Cements were based on four model glasses with varying reactivity and four poly(acrylic acid)s (PAA)s with number average molar masses (M-n) ranging from 3.25 x 10(4) to 1.08 x 10(5). Cement properties were studied at time intervals of one, seven and twenty eight days. Compressive strengths (sigma(c)) of the cements increased with increasing fluorine content of the glass, with increased molar mass of the PAA and with ageing time. The Young's moduli increased with time, but were lower for cements based on the fluorine free glass. Moduii values were independant of PAA molar mass. The un-notched fracture strength (sigma(f)) of the cement increased with the molar mass of the PAA and with ageing time. Glass composition did not appreciably influence the un-notched fracture strength. The fracture toughness (K-IC) increased with the molar mass of the PAA and with ageing time, but reduced with increasing fluorine content of the glass. The toughness (G(IC)) was dependant on molar mass. The influence of molar mass was not as great as predicted by the reptation chain pull-out model for fracture. The molar mass dependence of toughness was greatest with the lower fluorine content glasses. The plastic zone size at the crack tip increased with the molar mass of the PAA. However the plastic zone size decreased with ageing time for all the cements studied and was smaller for the more reactive higher fluorine content glasses.

Commonly, acute, postimplantation thrombocytopenia causes significant bleeding, requiring surgery or blood transfusions. Chronic complications include thromboembolic microevents that can affect central nervous system function. Pumps, explanted during donor organ transplantation, are often found to have an extensive cellular panus associated with the blood-contacting surfaces of the device. This natural cellular lining suggests a possible strategy for improving the blood biocompatibility of the HeartMate. Therefore, seeding of LVADs with cells genetically engineered to enhance their antithrombotic properties before implantation was investigated as a means to improve biocompatibility for long-term use. Methods and Results-Bovine vascular smooth muscle cells genetically engineered to produce nitric oxide were seeded on LVAD biomaterials and exposed to elevated shear stresses to determine cell-adhesive capabilities. Comparative studies were performed with vascular endothelial cells isolated from the same vessel. To assess the thrombogenic potential of the genetically engineered smooth muscle cells, monolayers were exposed to whole blood in parallel plate flow chambers and were platelet-adhesion quantified. This procedure used scanning electron microscopy and computer image-capture software. Endothelial cell monolayers and mock-transduced smooth muscle cells were assayed in a comparative manner. LVADs were seeded with genetically engineered smooth muscle cells and maintained under cell culture conditions for 96 hours. Thereafter, seeded LVADs were incorporated into in vitro flow loops. Cell retention within the pump was determined by sampling the effluent culture medium downstream of the pump and cell counting in a Coulter counter. After 18 hours of in vitro flow, a seeded pump was implanted into the abdominal cavity of a calf and anastomosed to the apex of the heart and to the descending aorta, More genetically engineered smooth muscle cells were retained on the surface of LVAD biomaterials when they were subjected to shear stresses up to 75 dyne/cm than endothelial cells assayed in the identical manner. Adherence of platelets to the surface of smooth muscle cells was significantly reduced after their transduction with nitric oxide synthase with GTP cyclohydrolase genes. Platelet deposition on the genetically modified myocyte layers was similar to that associated with endothelial cell layers. Cell loss from cell-seeded LVADs incorporated into in vitro flow loops remained <5% of the total cell number seeded regardless of the duration of flow. Conclusions-LVADs seeded with smooth muscle cells, transduced with the genes to optimize nitric oxide production, adhered well to the pump surface under in vitro and in vivo flow conditions.","Texas Heart Inst, Vasc Cell Biol Lab, Texas Med Ctr, Houston, TX 77225 USA; Texas Heart Inst, Texas Med Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Pathol, Houston, TX 77225 USA; Texas Heart Inst, Texas Med Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Surg Res, Houston, TX 77225 USA","Scott-Burden, T (reprint author), Texas Heart Inst, Vasc Cell Biol Lab, Texas Med Ctr, POB 20345, Houston, TX 77225 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-53233],,,25,2,2,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,NOV 10,1998.0,98,19,,S,,,II339,II345,,,,,,7,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,136YF,WOS:000076886100088,9852924.0,,,,2019-02-25

Endothelial cells, which release NO to inhibit platelet adhesion in vivo, generate NO at an estimated flux similar to the above values. At a NO exposure of 0.02 ppm, platelet inhibition was only 10%. The delivery device is useful for other studies in which a knowledge of the spatial NO fluxes or concentrations is desired. Knowledge of these fluxes or concentrations is beneficial towards the design of biomaterials incorporating NO to inhibit platelet adhesion. (C) 1998 Biomedical Engineering Society.

The contact of blood with biomaterials used in life-sustaining devices and numerous biomaterial-independent factors elicit a systemic inflammatory response, which involves activation of various plasma protein systems and blood cells, prolonged mechanical circulatory support elicits a systemic inflammatory response and hemostatic perturbations similar to that reported during cardiopulmonary bypass. However, in the setting of prolonged assistance, time has a complex and ill-known influence on blood activation. Methods to reduce blood activation during prolonged assisted circulation are derived from cardiopulmonary bypass investigations. Improving the biocompatibility of artificial devices can be achieved either by biomaterial surface modifications, by inhibition of biologic cascades leading to blood activation, or by controlling end points of biologic cascades. However, the necessity to respect the integrity of the organism during prolonged assistance precludes most systemic interventions and limits the control of blood activation to the area of the device.

The poly(anhydride-imides) examined were poly[trimellitylimidoglycine-co-1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane] (TMA-gly:CPH) in 10:90, 30:70 and 50:50 molar ratios and poly[pyromellitylimidoalanine-co-1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane] (PMA-ala,CPH) in 10:90 and 30:70 molar ratios. The polymer matrices were compression-molded into circular discs, then implanted in rat subcutaneous tissues for nearly two months. At defined time intervals, the animals were sacrificed and explants analyzed. Proton NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed a complete absence of imide monomer units in PMA-ala:CPH compositions after 28 d and complete removal of imide units at 56 d from TMA-gly matrices. Gross observation of the implants closely correlated to the imide content: with decreasing imide content, the explants darkened and fragmented at a faster rate. The chemical compositions of the poly(anhydride-imide) explants were also monitored using IR spectroscopy. The residual amount of anhydride bonds in the polymer backbone following implantation were calculated from peaks specific to the anhydride bonds relative to the total amount of carbonyl bonds present. Initially, the imide (TMA-gly or PMA-ala) anhydride bonds were rapidly hydrolyzed then solubilized, followed by the slower hydrolysis of the CPH monomer anhydride bonds.

These inflammatory reactions may induce degeneration of implanted biopolymer. Interactions between implanted biomaterial and inflammatory cells are mediated by many cellular events involving cellular adhesion and activation. We studied the inflammatory responses in vivo and in vitro to samples of biopolymers composed of poly(ethylene terephthalate-cn-diethylene glycol terephthalate) plus 0, 5, 25% of polyethylene oxide. We observed that these biopolymers did not induce inflammatory responses when implanted in the peritoneal cavity of mice for 28 days. However we observed deposition of hyaluronic acid at the surface of implanted biomaterial, suggesting that tolerance to biomaterial occurred after surgical implantation. No significant adhesion of inflammatory cells such as mononuclear phagocytes and peripheral leukocytes were observed in vitro, when poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-diethylene glycol terephthalate) blends were used as substratum to cellular adhesion. These results suggest that blends composed of poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-diethylene glycol terephthalate) induce low inflammatory cell adhesion, since no rejection of biopolymer was observed when implanted in experimental animal models.

The biocompatibility of a material is determined by interactions at the interface between implant and biological system. The physicochemical surface properties of the materials used, for example, chemical composition, wettability, surface energy and electrical surface charge, therefore play an important role. Within the framework of the investigations described here, specific modifications of the surfaces properties of titanium are effected using various methods with the aim of achieving a positive influence on cell growth and cell attachment. To characterize the physicochemical surface properties, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used. In addition to the clearly altered chemical composition of the modified material surface, it proved possible to determine significant changes in the thermodynamic properties with the aid of contact angle measurements and the determination of surface energy. On the basis of these results, important information about possible interactions at the interface between implant and tissue can be obtained.","Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, Fachbereich Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany","Liefeith, K (reprint author), Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, Fachbereich Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

The efficacy and safety of the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of hard denial tissue as well as the effects of dental irradiation on the pulp and periodontium have been investigated. Odors resulting from laser irradiation have been reported, but the nature and toxicity of associated decomposition vapors is unknown and the health consequences of their inhalation have not yet been studied. Objectives. The purpose of this in vitro study was to identify vapors emitted during interaction of the Nd:YAG laser with carious human enamel and dentin and sound enamel and dentin coated with organic ink. Methods. Vapor emissions were collected from prepared sections of extracted human teeth receiving laser irradiation of 100 mJ and 10 Hz for a duration of 1, 10, or 60 s. Emissions were collected by means of charcoal absorption tubes, and subsequently analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph equipped with Mass Selective (GC/MS) and Flame Ionization Detectors to identify the chemical constituents of the vapors. Results. No compounds were identified in Nd:YAG laser-treated caries, enamel and dentin. No volatile vapors were identified from samples of tooth material exposed to the laser for 1 or 10 s. Camphor was positively identified in the test sample which consisted of India ink-coated dentin and the reference sample of India ink-coated glass beads, both exposed to the laser for 60 s. 2,5-norbornadiene was tentatively identified in these samples. The Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of camphor is 2 ppm with a Lethal Dose Level (LDLo) of 50 mg/kg (human oral), while the TLV and LDLo of 2,5-norboradiene is unknown. Significance. Occupational and public health safety measures are discussed in this article. Further research is needed to quantify the compounds produced and to determine their toxicity to patients and to dental care providers. (C) 1999 Academy of Dental Materials.

Biomaterial surfaces engineered to present cell adhesion ligands undergo integrin-mediated molecular interactions with cells (1, 4, 5), stimulating cell spreading, and differentiation (6-8). This provides a mechanism for mimicking natural cell-to-matrix interactions. Further sophistication in the control of cell interactions can be achieved by fabricating surfaces on which the spatial distribution of ligands is restricted to micron-scale pattern features (9-14). Patterning technology promises to facilitate spatially controlled tissue engineering with applications in the regeneration of highly organized tissues. These new applications require the formation of ligand patterns on biocompatible and biodegradable templates, which control tissue regeneration processes, before removal by metabolism. We have developed a method of generating micron-scale patterns of any biotinylated ligand on the surface of a biodegradable block copolymer, polylactide-poly(ethylene glycol). The technique achieves control of biomolecule deposition with nanometer precision. Spatial control over cell development has been observed when using these templates to culture bovine aortic endothelial cells and PC12 nerve cells. Furthermore, neurite extension on the biodegradable polymer surface is: directed by pattern features composed of peptides containing the IKVAV sequence (15, 16), suggesting that directional control over nerve regeneration on biodegradable biomaterials can be achieved.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",kevin.shakesheff@nottingham.ac.uk,"Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009; Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009","Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,51,201,205,2,27,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,NOV,1998.0,12,14,,,,,1447,1454,,,,,,8,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,134NM,WOS:000076749500003,9806753.0,,,,2019-02-25

The BMPs are the only factors known to provoke bone formation heterotopically by making undifferentiated formation heterotopically by making undifferentiated mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts (osteoinduction). Much of our knowledge of osteoinduction derives from studies in rodents of heterotopically implanted demineralised bone which contains various growth factors, including BMPs. This model has been used to examine the effect on osteoinduction of different factors, including the type of host soft tissue, age and species of donor and recipients, demineralisation procedure, storage and sterilisation procedures, experimental diabetes, dietary factors, hormones, growth factors, caffeine, biphosphonates, indomethacin and biomaterials. Demineralised bone enhances bone formation experimentally in various animal models, including cranio-maxillofacial reconstructions, healing of diaphyseal defects, and spinal fusion; demineralised bone has also been used in a limited way clinically.

It was found that chondrocytes retained their spherical shape and typical chondrocytic appearance. During the culture time, chondrocytes underwent differentiation, as demonstrated by the alkaline phosphatase-specific activity and rate of proteoglycan synthesis. Morphological data confirmed chondrocyte differentiation with the appearance of hypertrophic chondrocytes scattered in the alginate gel and a dense extracellular matrix containing filamentous structures and matrix resides. In addition, Northern blot analysis performed on day 8 of culture showed that chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads expressed type II collagen mRNA. The alginate bead method also appeared to be suitable for testing biomaterials, and the ready dissolution of the alginate beads by chelating agents provided a simple means for the rapid recovery of encapsulated chondrocytes. Powdered glass-ceramic particles entrapped in the alginate gel were colonized by chondrocytes, which then proliferated and formed a tissue similar to a true calcified cartilaginous structure. These results indicate that the alginate system represents a relevant model for studies of chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification. Furthermore, the encapsulation method could prove useful for studies of tissue-biomaterial interactions in an in vitro environment which more closely mirrors the cartilage matrix than other culture methods.

Mean surface roughness was 262 nm for the Ti alloy disks and 4.756 nm for the coated culture plates. Osteoblasts isolated from 16-day chick embryo calvariae were cultured on polystyrene, thin films, and disks. At confluence, the cells were cultured an additional 48 h and were evaluated for cell number (DNA content), rate of glycolysis (lactate production), alkaline phosphatase activity (ALPase), and collagenous (H-3-proline hydroxylation) and noncollagenous protein synthesis. Cell morphology was similar for the controls, disks, and thin-film groups. DNA, lactate, cell layer ALPase, H-3-hydroxyproline, and noncollagenous protein were not different (p > 0.05) among the control, thin-film, and disk groups. Medium ALPase was lower (p < 0.05) in the thin-film group compared to the control group. Although aluminum and vanadium percentages varied from nominal in the thin-film groups (11A1-2V as opposed to 6A1-4V), avian osteoblasts responded similarly to the Ti alloy thin films, disks, and uncoated culture plates for the smooth surfaces tested. The thin-film cell culture system used for elemental material studies appears to offer a promising method for the investigation of cellular response to alloyed biomaterials as well. Proper adjustments in alloy percentages before deposition, however, need to be made if thermal evaporation is utilized.

When oxide films are abraded, repassivation and ionic dissolution both occur at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than undisrupted surfaces. The excess electrons generated by these anodic processes must be consumed in corresponding reduction reactions that include the reduction of oxygen. If large enough, these reduction reactions may locally deplete the concentration of solution-dissolved oxygen and, in turn, affect cell behavior in the vicinity of the implant surface. To date, this hypothesis has not been tested. In the present study, a scanning electrochemical microscope was used to measure oxygen concentration profiles in vitro near a planar titanium electrode polarized to different voltages representative of those attainable by titanium undergoing mechanically assisted corrosion. The potentials investigated ranged from 0 mV to -1000 mV (AgCl). The oxygen concentration as a function of distance from the titanium surface was measured using a platinum-iridium microelectrode and an amperometric technique. Also, preliminary experiments were performed to assess the response of rat calvarial osteoblast-rich cells cultured for 2 h on titanium samples polarized to two different potentials (0 mV and -1000 mV versus AgCl). The results of this study indicate that oxygen concentrations near titanium surfaces are affected by sample potentials out to probe-sample distances as great as 500 mu m. Within 2 mu m of the surface, oxygen concentrations decreased by 15 to 25% for sample potentials between -100 and -500 mV. At potentials more negative than -600 mV, the oxygen concentration dropped rapidly to near zero by -900 mV. The cell experiments showed a statistically significant difference in the amount of cell spreading, as measured by projected cell area, between the two groups (p < 0.03), with the cells cultured at -1000 mV undergoing much less spreading. This implies that -1000 mV inhibits normal cell behavior at the titanium surface and that this is most likely due, at least in part, to a diminished oxygen supply.

Initially the S2-glass(R) composites were generally stiffer and stronger than comparably reinforced quartz composites, but within 1 wk the properties of S2-glass(R) composites decreased by 12%-26%. The properties of quartz composites were relatively stable, except for those of composites with the least reinforcement (35 vol%), which decreased by roughly 15%. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that in all composites buckling had occurred at the site of load application. Evidence of good fibre-matrix adhesion was observed for both types of composites under all conditions. Modelling of degradation between 1 wk and 3 mon revealed that: (1) the only temporal change was a slight increase in the stiffness of S2-glass(R) composites; and (2) higher reinforcement levels reduced the retention of strength in S2-glass(R) composites but had the opposite effect ton both properties) for quartz composites (p < 0.05). For the most highly reinforced S2-glass(R) composites, susceptibility to degradation was offset by high initial properties; and after ageing (elastic modulus approximate to 50 GPa, strength approximate to 1.2 GPa), these composites were still, on average, approximately 25% stiffer and 50% stronger than the more hydrostable quartz counterparts.

The experiment was carried out on 25 Wistar rats. After exposing the mandibular ramus bilaterally, 5 mm diameter full-thickness circular bone defects were surgically created. While the defect on one side was covered by the membrane (experimental), the defect on the other side was left uncovered (control) before closure of the overlying soft tissues. The rats were sacrificed in groups of 5 after 7, 15, 30, 90, and 180 days of healing. Although at early stages of healing similar amounts of bone formation were observed in the experimental and control defects, after 1 month of healing, most of the experimental defects were completely closed with new bone, while in the control defects, only limited amounts of new bone were observed at the rims and in the lingual aspect of the lesions. In the 90- and 180-day animals, all experimental defects were completely closed, while in the control defects, no statistically significant increase in bone regeneration was observed. The increase in percentage of bone regeneration in the experimental defects was statistically significant between the 15-day specimens as compared with the 7-day specimens (P < 0.01) and likewise between 30-day and 15-day specimens (P < 0.001). It can be concluded that a DPPA-crosslinked collagen membrane yields biocompatibility, ad hoc mechanical hindrance, and handling characteristics suitable for guided bone regeneration applications in this experimental model.","Univ Liege, Sart Tilman Univ Hosp, Sch Dent, Dept Periodontol & Implantol, Liege, Belgium; Catholic Univ Louvain, Sch Dent Med, Dept Periodontol, Brussels, Belgium; Free Univ Brussels, Brugmann Univ Hosp, Dept Periodontol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Toulouse 3, Fac Odontol, Dept Oral Biol, F-31062 Toulouse, France; Univ Liege, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Liege, Fac Med, Dept Histol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Geneva, Fac Med Dent, Dept Oral Surg & Stomatol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Zahedi, S (reprint author), European Oral Rehabil Ctr, Rue de la Loi 235, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",shahram.zahedi@skynet.be,,,,,,44,46,47,0,2,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690 USA",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Since fibrinogen (FBGN) and immunoglobulin (IgG) coat the implanted biomaterial surface, it is with these immobilized proteins that the neutrophil (PMN) interacts. This study tests the hypothesis that PMN are impaired in their ability to kill bacteria when bound to immobilized IgG or FBGN. Isolated human PMN were bound to FBGN or IgG: and then left untreated or exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 10(-7) M). PMN adhered loosely, but did not spread, onto FBGN. In contrast, PMN spread fully onto IgG, exhibiting polarized pseudopodia. PMA treatment induced spreading of the FBGN bound cells. Suspended and adherent PMN were incubated 1 h with C-14-labeled Staphylococcus aureus; then, phagocytosis was assessed by radioactive uptake or bacterial kill. was determined by plating recovered bacteria and colony counting. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test. We observed that both the phagocytic and the killing ability of FBGN-bound PMN were similar to that of suspended PMN. Conversely, IgG-bound PMN displayed a 62 +/- 6% (P < 0.01) decrease in phagocytosis and 33 +/- 7% (P < 0.05) reduction in bill vs suspended cells. PMA induced a 74 +/- 6% (P < 0.01) reduction in phagocytosis and 68 +/- 5% (P < 0.01) reduction in kill of bacteria for PMN bound to FBGN with no further effect on IgG-bound PMN. Using fluorescent vital dyes and confocal microscopy we determined that 33% fewer PMN were engaged in phagocytosis when bound to IgG vs FBGN. We conclude that Fc receptor ligation by immobilized IgG or PMA treatment of the FBGN-adherent PMN triggers cell spreading and reduced bactericidal activity. These results indicate that excessive cytoskeletal organization may impair the ability of PMN to kill bacteria and result in vascular graft infections.

Methods: These biomaterials were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsum of 11 guinea pigs after contamination with Staphylococcus aureus and examined with scanning electron microscopy after 7 days. Wounds were also inspected for infection and extrusion rates. Results: Results show biofilm formation on titanium, silicone, ion-bombarded silicone, e-PTFE, and PHDPE associated with high rates of extrusion and infection. Implants of e-PTFE with silver/chlorhexidine, on the other hand, appeared resistant to biofilm formation and demonstrated significantly lower rates of extrusion and infection. Conclusions: contamination of bioimplants in vivo leads to formation of bacterial biofilm on the surface of the biomaterial, causing infection, pus formation, and extrusion. The authors hypothesize that the antiseptic agents impregnated in the biomaterial form a protective coat of silver, chlorhexidine, and inflammatory cells that inhibits initial bacterial adhesion to the biomaterial surface.","Univ Maryland, Med Syst, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Biedlingmaier, JF (reprint author), Maryland Gen Hosp, Head Serv, 827 Linden Ave, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",,,,,,,21,22,23,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0023-852X,,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,NOV,1998.0,108,11,1,,,,1733,1738,,10.1097/00005537-199811000-00026,,,,6,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,136NY,WOS:000076867000026,9818835.0,,,,2019-02-25

This behavior is in contrast to the general situation with synthetic composites, where toughness is generally found to decrease with increase in modulus and tensile strength. Preserving toughness is very important in many applications, as very high strength cannot be exploited if a material is sensitive to small amounts of damage. The structures-properties relationships documented in biomaterials may provide guidance for improving the performance of synthetic composites, in a type of biomimicry. This paper identifies some key aspects of such biomimetic designs in natural fibers and composites, and describes some efforts in the recent past to duplicate structures and properties in synthetic composite materials, particularly with regard to toughness.

However, the broader application of ceramics is limited because they are brittle and prone to catastrophic failure. By contrast, naturally produced ceramic organic biocomposites can possess mechanical properties which make them suitable for use as biomaterials. An example would be the mollusc shell, where an inorganic phase grows onto a charged and organised organic template. This natural biomineralization provides a calcium carbonate phase with satisfactory mechanical properties appropriate for surgical implantation. It is reported how Langmuir Blodgett films have been used as organic templates for calcium phosphate crystallization. Three different Langmuir Blodgett Films: omega tricosenoic acid, stearic acid and octadecylamine have been investigated. The Langmuir Blodgett Films produced had methyl (CH3) and calcium carboxylate (CaCOO) as functional groups. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy shows that calcium phosphate crystallization occurs in a similar manner to natural biomineralization. The calcium carboxylate head group appears to have a physical influence on the morphology and distribution of the calcium phosphate crystals. Under the experimental conditions tested, the calcium carboxylate functional head group controls calcium phosphate crystallization by a biomimetic approach. This study strongly suggests that this approach has the potential for producing high performance ceramics comparable with those made by mollusc shells. (C) 1998 IPEM.

During the last few years, much attention has been paid to hydroxyapatite and p-tricalcium phosphate as potential biomaterials for a bone substitute. Good implantation of biomaterials in the skeleton is evidenced by an ability to reach full integration of the non-living implant with living bone. The aim of this study is to correlate hydroxyapatite osseointegration with Young's Modulus. Cylinders (5-6 mm in diameter) of these ceramics were packed into holes made in the femur diaphysis of a mature sheep. At 2, 4. 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after the operation, samples of the bone/implant interface were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate.

At 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after implantation we studied Young's Modulus on a biopsy of the ceramic. Young's Modulus increased with time after implantation and is linked with biomaterials integration into cortical bone. (C) 1999 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since a large number of biomaterials are currently used in neurosurgery, only the biomaterials that have been developed in our laboratories in collaboration with neurosurgeons are briefly presented here. The biomaterials developed include devices used for interventional neurosurgery and bioabsorbable scaffolds for regeneration of dura mater and skull bone. We developed an immediately electrically detachable coil using a poly(vinyl alcohol) junction between the coil and the delivery wire. This is the first detachable coil developed in Japan and is currently under clinical trial. In addition to the coil used for interventional neurosurgery, the development of an embolic liquid is presented, As an alternative to allografts such as Lyodura, we developed a dural substitute from synthetic bioabsorbable polymers which are completely free from potential risk of latent virus infection. Finally, our experience in tissue engineering for skull bone regeneration using growth factors coupled with polymeric carriers is presented to demonstrate the promise of tissue engineering in the future.","Kyoto Univ, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Ikada, Y (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, 53 Kawahara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",,,,,,,7,4,4,0,3,JAPAN NEUROSURGICAL SOC,TOKYO,"C/O AKAMON-MAE IWATA BLDG, 5-27-8 HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",0387-2572,,,NEUROL MED-CHIR,Neurol.

The results are presented in the form of current-voltage characteristics for the temperature range 300-360 K. The analysis of the results obtained by plotting the temperature dependence of current density, Poole-Frenkel plots, Schottky plots, Richardson plots and Arrhenius plots shows that the Schottky-Richardson mechanism is responsible for the observed d.c. conduction in amylase. Furthermore, the presence of Schottky barriers at the metal electrode-insulator interface suggests that, by using silver electrodes, satisfactory contacts can be achieved for electrical investigations on biomaterials.

The esterification reactions were conducted in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine as a catalyst. The optimal reaction time (6 h) was determined by monitoring the concentration of free carboxylic acid of the N-protected amino acids during the reaction. The degree of substitution per fructose unit was 0.95 for inulin-lysine and 1.01 for inulin-glycine. The resulting biopolymer was deprotected by catalytic transfer hydrogenation method using 1,4-cyclohexadiene as an effective hydrogen donor. The structures, molecular weight, and thermal properties of the amino acid esters of inulin were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H-1 and C-13 NMR, UV, viscosity, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

These polymers degrade by hydrolysis and enzymatic activity and have a range of mechanical and physical properties that can be engineered appropriately to suit a particular application. Their degradation characteristics depend on several parameters including their molecular structure, crystallinity, and copolymer ratio. These biomaterials are also rapidly gaining recognition in the hedging field of tissue engineering because they can be fashioned into porous scaffolds or carriers of cells, extracellular matrix components, and bioactive agents. Although their future appears to be bright, several questions regarding the biocompatibility of these materials linger and should be addressed before their wide-scale use. In the context of musculoskeletal tissue, this report provides a comprehensive review of properties and applications of biodegradable PLA/PGA polymers and their copolymers. Of special interest are orthopaedic applications, biocompatibility studies, and issues of sterilization and storage of these versatile biomaterials. Also discussed is the fact that terms such as PLA, PGA, or PLA-PGA do not denote one material, but rather a large family of materials that have a wide range of differing bioengineering properties and concomitant biological responses. An analysis of some misconceptions, problems, and potential solutions is also provided.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA; Plano Orthoped & Sports Med Ctr, Plano, TX USA","Athanasiou, KA (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA.",,,,,,,95,281,296,6,82,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0749-8063,1526-3231,,ARTHROSCOPY,Arthroscopy,OCT,1998.0,14,7,,,,,726,737,,10.1016/S0749-8063(98)70099-4,,,,12,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,127VY,WOS:000076372300009,9788368.0,,,,2019-02-25

Results indicated the absolute absence of cytotoxic or cytostatic effect of Pyrost(R) on cultured osteoblasts. Viability rate was more than 90% in cells cultured with the material compared to the control. Morphological analysis, undertaken by scanning electron microscopy showed a good adhesion and a spreading of osteoblasts in contact with the material that was colonized by cultured cells. In the second part of this work, we have introduced two methods as complementary biocompatibility tests: DNA image cytometry and interphase Ag-NORs quantification. DNA content was measured in cells cultured with or without Pyrost(R) for 3, 9, 15 and 30 days. The determination of DNA indicated that the majority of osteoblasts population was diploid without aneuploidy. The DNA index and cell distribution profile in DNA histograms were similar in all cell populations. The Ag-NORs amount was used as a parameter for cell kinetic evaluation. We have measured the Ag-NORs index like DNA quantification. The proliferation rate, evaluated by Ag-NORs counts in osteoblasts cultured with or without the material, was identical. However, a decrease in Ag-NORs index was observed from day 3 to day 15 of incubation. These results showed a satisfactory biocompatibility of the Pyrost(R) in human osteoblasts culture, The material did not alter cell viability and had no inducing effect either on proliferation rate or on cell ploidy as demonstrated by DNA image cytometry and Ag-NORs proteins staining.

We have studied the growth and interactions of human bone marrow cells on a variety of new cement composites in vitro. These cement materials are composed of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatites, carbonated apatite and amorphous calcium phosphate. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced and cell differentiation increased in the presence of these cements compared with cells cultured on tissue culture plastic. Alkaline phosphatase, one of the markers of the osteoblast phenotype, was dramatically stimulated by 3 of the 4 cements examined between day 4 and day 10, above levels observed following culture of human osteoblasts on plastic alone. Photomicroscopic examination demonstrated growth and close integration of bone marrow cells and 3 of the composites. Longer term marrow cultures (15 day) on the cements confirmed the stimulation of cell differentiation over proliferation. From these studies, enhanced osteoblastic differentiation was observed on a 70% carbonated apatite, which has a composition similar to bone mineral, whereas, cell toxicity was observed on cells grown on amorphous calcium phosphate. This in vitro culture system demonstrates the use of human bone marrow cells for the potential evaluation of new biomaterials and the development of a novel carbonated apatite that may be of potential use in orthopaedic implants.

Polyethylene-glycol-diisocyanate (PEG-diisocyanate, 3400 MW) may potentially react with protein amines to form molecular barriers on adsorbed proteins on biomaterials, thereby masking adhesive ligands and preventing acute surface thrombosis. To test this notion, PE, PTFE, and glass microconduits were pre-adsorbed with fibrinogen and treated with PEG-diisocyanate, non-reactive PEG-dihydroxyl, or remained untreated. Following perfusion of In-111-labeled platelets in whole human blood for 1 min (wall shear rate = 312 s(-1)), PEG-diisocyanate treated surfaces experienced 96% (PE), 97% (PTFE) and 94% (glass) less platelet deposition than untreated surfaces. Similar reductions were seen for PEG-diisocyanate versus PEG-dihydroxyl treatment. Low shear perfusions of plasma for 1 h prior to blood contact did not reduce the inhibitory effect of PEG-diisocyanate. Platelet adhesion onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and platelet deposition onto preclotted Dacron were also reduced by treatment with PEG-diisocyanate(93 and 91%, respectively). Protein-reactive PEG may thus have utility in forming molecular barriers on surface-associated proteins to inhibit acute thrombosis on cardiovascular biomaterials.

Background: Although several attempts have been made to occlude defects within the oval fossa by transcatheter techniques, none of these has gained general acceptance. Methods: Patients with a defect in the oval fossa measuring equal to or less than 20 mm diameter, with a residual septal rim of 5mm or greater, body weight greater than 10 kg, with clinical indications for surgical closure were considered for transcatheter closure. Follow-up investigations were performed at discharge, after 1, 3, 6 and 3 months, as well as after 1 and 2 years. Results: Of 78 patients considered for closure, a device was inserted in 41 patients (53%), with success being achieved in 40 patients (98%). The ages ranged from 1.1 to 15 years (7.8 +/- 1.92 years), the 'stretched' diameter of the defect from 10 to 20 mm (14.7 +/- 2.60 mm), and the diameters of the inserted devices from 25 to 45 mm (33.2 +/- 5.43 mm). Transient impairment of atrioventricular conduction occured in 4 patients. During the follow-up of 23.0 +/- 5.6 months elective surgical closure of a residual shunt was performed 26 months after insertion of the devcie in one patient. None of the other patients required surgery, hospitalisation or medical treatment, and none is requiring further treatment of the defect within the oval fossa. Fracture of one arn of the device occurred in 4 patients, bur the fractured arms are in an unchanged and stable position after a period of at least 19 months. Conclusions: Our medium-term data show that transcatheter closure in children of defects within the oval fossa can be performed with a high efficacy and safety using the ASDOS-device.","Med Hsch Hannover, Dept Pediat Cardiol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; Charite Berlin, Dept Pediat Cardiol, Berlin, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch Klinikum, Dept Pediat Cardiol, D-4300 Essen, Germany; Univ Kiel, Dept Pediat Cardiol, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; Guys Hosp, Dept Pediat Cardiol, London SE1 9RT, England; Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Pediat Cardiol, Geneva, Switzerland","Hausdorf, G (reprint author), Med Hsch Hannover, Dept Pediat & Pediat Cardiol 3, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,29,12,13,0,0,GREENWICH MEDICAL MEDIA LTD,LONDON,"219 LINEN HALL, 162-168 REGENT ST, LONDON W1R 5TB, ENGLAND",1047-9511,,,CARDIOL YOUNG,Cardiol.

Osteogenic bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from 18-day-old embryonic chickens, while osteoclastic cells were isolated from laying White Leghorn hens on calcium-deficient diets. Osteoclastic cells (5 x 10(5)) were seeded onto mineral thin films and suspended above osteogenic cells (1 x 10(4)) already plated on the bottoms of tissue culture plate wells. The data showed that after 4 days of incubation there was up to a fivefold (P < 0.05) reduction in all measured parameters of osteogenesis (mineralization, alkaline phosphatase activity and type I collagen production) in osteogenic cultures grown in the presence of osteoclastic cells. Similarly, osteoclastic cell-induced mineral resorption was reduced up to threefold (P < 0.05), Go-culture effects on cellular responses could be manipulated by known antiresorptive agents (e.g., pamidronate) altering either the source or the age of osteoclastic cells.

Finally, the ability of FT-IRM to map new bone formed in implanted macroporous calcium phosphate biomaterial from sections was reported for the first time. FT-IRM allowed the correlation of the microstructure of bone formation in the in vivo model with modifications in carbonate and phosphate environments of the mineral phases during maturation. FT-IRM analysis on enamel sections revealed changes in the mineral environment of carbonate and phosphate ions and probably in the size of enamel crystals. These modifications contributed to the fragility of enamel in osteogenesis imperfecta. The infrared functional group imaging of a part of implanted biomaterial and the bone ingrowth provided the visualization of chemical modifications occurring in biomaterial implants at 20 mu m spatial resolution. The use of FT-IRM, in conjunction with appropriate sampling methods and data analysis should provide further insight into the molecular structure of mineral phases of calcified tissues and help to elucidate mineralization processes, skeletal disorders and properties of the biomaterials used as bone substitute.

The biofilm contains the capsular polysaccharide/adhesin (PS/A), which mediates cell adherence to biomaterials, and another antigen, termed polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is thought to mediate bacterial accumulation into cellular aggregates. PIA is a polymer of beta-1,6-linked N-acetyl glucosamine residues with a molecular mass of<30,000 kDa, We found that recombinant Staphylococcus carnosus and Staphylococcus aureus carrying a plasmid with genes of the ica locus, which was reported to encode the biosynthetic proteins for production of PIA, were also able to synthesize PS/A, PS/A and a chemically and immunologically identical polysaccharide isolated from S, carnosus carrying the ica genes on plasmid pCN27 were found to be high-molecular-mass (>250,000 kDa), acid-stable polymers of beta-1,6-linked glucosamine substituted on the amino group primarily with succinate, although some preparations also contained acetate, Moreover, all recombinant staphylococcal strains with the ica genes had the biologic properties previously attributed to PS/A, ica-positive strains readily formed an in vitro biofilm on plastic, adhered 3- to 10-fold more to catheters during a 30-min assay compared with control strains carrying only the cloning vector, adsorbed out antibodies to PS/A from immune serum, and elaborated a capsule visualized by immunoelectron microscopy with antisera to PS/A. These properties were also seen with PS/A-producing strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but not with transposon mutants lacking PS/A, An antiserum raised to PIA contained high-titer antibody to PS/A that was readily adsorbed out by PS/A-positive strains of S, epidermidis and recombinant strains of staphylococci carrying the ica genes. We conclude that the ica locus encodes production of PS/A and that the properties of S. epidermidis associated with initial bacterial adherence, biofilm formation, and intercellular adhesion can be correlated with elaboration of PS/A.","Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","McKenney, D (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Lab, 181 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",david.mckenney@channing.harvard.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI 23335],,,37,210,219,1,10,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,1098-5522,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

These polymers are A-B-type copolymers consisting of an alternating sequence of a diphenol and a diacid. The library was prepared by copolymerizing, in all possible combinations, 14 different tyrosine-derived diphenols and eight different aliphatic diacids, resulting in 8 x 14 = 112 distinct polymers. This approach (a) increases the number of available polymeric candidate materials for medical applications, and (b) facilitates the identification of correlations between polymer structure and glass transition temperature, air-water contact angle, mechanical properties, and fibroblast proliferation. The pendent chain and backbone structures were systematically varied by (a) simple homologative variations in the number of methylene groups, (b) substitution of oxygen for methylene groups, and (c) introduction of branched and aromatic structures. The polymers contained within the library exhibited incremental variations in T-g (from 2 degrees C to 91 degrees C) and air-water contact angle (from 64 degrees to 101 degrees). Fibroblast proliferation (in vitro, serum-containing media) ranged from approximating that measured on tissue culture polystyrene to complete absence of proliferation. Generally, decreased proliferation correlated linearly with increased surface hydrophobicity, except in those polymers derived from oxygen-containing diacids in their backbone which were uniformly good growth substrates even if their surfaces were very hydrophobic. In a selected subgroup of polymers, tensile strength of thin solvent cast films ranged from about 6 to 45 MPa, while Young's modulus (stiffness) ranged from about 0.3 to 1.7 Cpa. Combinatorial biomaterial libraries such as these tyrosine-derived polyarylates permit the systematic study of material-dependent biological responses and provide the medical device designer with the option to choose a suitable material from a library of related polymers that encompasses a broad range of properties.

However, natural coral transformed into calcite by heating has never been tested. The objective of this work was to study the proliferation and alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, and osteocalcin expression of human bone marrow cells cultured on CaCO3 crystallized both in the aragonite form (natural coral) and in the calcite form (natural coral modified by heating). The methods used to characterize calcite obtained from the coral were volumic porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction. Cell colonization of the material was assessed by SEM performed on days 1, 7, 20, and 30 and [H-3]thymidine incorporation was performed on days 3, 7, 12, 18, 25, and 32. Phenotypic expression was assessed by using in situ cytochemistry (alkaline phosphatase), immunocytochemistry (osteonectin and osteocalcin), and hybridization (osteocalcin, beta-actin, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA). Results showed the transformation of aragonite into calcite after heating, the conservation of macro-porosity, and a modification of the surface. Calcite appeared to have a smoother and more uniform surface than aragonite crystals. As for [H-3]thymidine there was an increase incorporation from days 3 to 18, a stabilization from days 18 to 25, and a decrease from days 25 to 32. After 20 days of culture, immunological studies using monoclonal antibodies to osteocalcin, osteonectin, cytochemical analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity, and in situ hybridization using osteocalcin, beta-actin, and alkaline phosphatase cDNA indicated that the cells had not lost their osteoblastic phenotype. These experiments demonstrate that coral crystallized in the aragonite or calcite form present a similar degree of specific cytocompatibility.

Contacting platelets were quantitatively more active, with motions including rolling, detachment, oscillatory vibration, and change of direction only on the HEMA-St block copolymer surface. Active platelet movements were observed for long time periods (>20 min) on HEMA-St block copolymer surfaces and were distinct from those for inert PSt latex particles on these same surfaces, demonstrating that platelet movements were not due to physical forces such as convection, hydrophobic interactions, or microbrownian movement. To study the cause and mechanism underlying the platelet movements, platelets treated with an adenosine triphosphate (Am) synthesis inhibition, NaN3, or a membrane skeleton-disrupting chemical agent, dibucaine, were also studied on these surfaces. Both treatments reduced platelet movement and demonstrated that platelets in contact with the HEMA-St block copolymer surface require metabolic processes consuming ATP and involve dynamics of their membrane skeleton. These energy-consuming active movements might explain the previously observed lower platelet activation and low thrombogenicity of the HEMA-St block copolymers. Enhanced platelet movements on the HEMA-St block copolymer surface show that the microdomain surface interacts uniquely with platelets to hinder activation and preserve passive platelet function despite surface contact.

To understand the importance of discrete biomaterial chemical characteristics in modifying host tissue responses, we constructed surfaces bearing different functional groups using radio frequency glow discharge plasma polymerization. Surfaces evaluated included those having high concentrations of -OH, -NH2, -CF3, and siloxyl groups. These surfaces and polyethylene terephthalate controls were used to assess the importance of particular physicochemical characteristics in surface:protein:cell interactions both in vitro and in vivo. The results obtained show that surface functionalities do significantly affect both the adsorption and ""denaturation"" of adsorbed fibrinogen (which is an important mediator of inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants). In addition, these surfaces provoke different degrees of acute inflammatory responses. Interestingly, the amounts of ""denatured"" fibrinogen that spontaneously accumulate on the individual surfaces correlate closely with the extent of biomaterial-mediated inflammation. These results suggest that surfaces that tend to ""irreversibly"" bind fibrinogen prompt greater acute inflammatory responses. Unexpectedly, all test surfaces except those bearing a siloxyl group engender relatively similar biomaterial-mediated fibrotic responses. Thus surface functionalities alone may not be sufficient to affect subsequent fibrotic responses.

The properties of the hardened HAp bodies were characterized by measuring compressive strength and X-ray diffraction, The compressive strength of the hardened bodies depended on the amount of DCPD, types of carboxylic acids, concentrations of carboxylic acid solutions, water/solid weight ratios, aging time and temperature. Particularly, the type of carboxylic acid considerably influenced the compressive strength. For example, utilization of glycine as a carboxylic acid showed a value of 5.5 MPa in compressive strength at maximum although that of maric acid showed a value of only 3.0 MPa. The values of compressive strength were positively correlated to the first dissociation constant.

This increase in cost and morbidity has been associated with several epidemiological trends that map contribute to access failure. These include late patient referral to nephrologists and surgeons, late planning of vascular access as well as a shift from A-V fistulaes to PTFE grafts and temporary catheters, which have a higher failure rate. The reasons for this shift in the types of access is multifactorial and is not explained by changes in the co-morbidities of patients presenting to dialysis. Surgical preference and training also appear to play an important role in the large regional variation and patency rate of these PTFE grafts. We propose a program for early placement of A-V fistulae, a continuous quality improvement, multidisciplinary program to monitor access outcome, the development of new biomaterials, and a research plan to investigate pharmacological intervention to reduce development of stenosis and clinical interventions to treat those that do develop, prior to thrombosis.","Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Nashville, TN USA; Maine Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Portland, ME 04102 USA","Hakim, R (reprint author), Renal Care Grp Inc, 2100 W End Ave,Suite 800, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R01-HL36015-12]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK45610-05],,,102,209,215,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0085-2538,,,KIDNEY INT,Kidney Int.,OCT,1998.0,54,4,,,,,1029,1040,,10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.00122.x,,,,12,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,122XN,WOS:000076096900001,9767519.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

The toxicological effects of dental alloys depend mainly on their element specific corrosion behaviour in the oral cavity. The present study demonstrates the electrochemical boundary conditions regarding the possible formation of AgCl-corrosion products, for which cytotoxic effects has been established, by means of specially adapted electrochemical in-vitro test programs. The prevalence of the developed corrosion mode was proved for two electrolytes and four daily used dental alloys containing different amounts of silver. The results show, that a biological relevant assessment of the released silver ions in both electrolytes, induced by anodic metal dissolution, is only reliable if the measurement takes into account the silver ions within the electrolyte as well as the superficial immobilized amount of silver chloride corrosion products. Thus especially from a biological point of view, interface processes like the formation of immobilized corrosion products seem to be a relevant parameter for the complete testing of biocompatibility of metallic biomaterials. To sum up it can be concluded, that the dental alloys investigated in the course of this study have not shown any adverse susceptibility to corrosion with respect to the clinical practice and can therefore be classified as well biocompatible.","Inst Bioproc & Analyt Measurement Tech eV, Dept Biomat Rosenhof, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany","Hildebrand, G (reprint author), Inst Bioproc & Analyt Measurement Tech eV, Dept Biomat Rosenhof, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0947-5117,1521-4176,,MATER CORROS,Mater.

LUV assemblies were immobilized to 21 nmol phospholipid in one capillary, about twice as high as found for the SUV assemblies. Estimated values showed that the capillary inner surface was coated by 4-15 liposome layers. The liposome-coated capillary can be used in capillary electrophoresis for microanalysis of drug membrane interactions.

MAD carries a maleimide function for thermochemical modification of thiolated molecules and a diazirine function that is lost during light activation (350 nm light). Photoactivation leads to carbene-mediated grafting to solid supports. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy atomic constituents and chemical shifts, as well as ToF-SIMS molecular peaks and characteristic fragments of the photoimmobilized molecule, are identified. Extended interpretation of surface analysis data suggests that diamond is the substrate with the highest MAD grafting efficiency and that the formation of C-O bonds upon diazirine photoactivation is involved.

The mechanism of permeability control for caffeine and vitamin B-12 through composite-MPG membranes was determined to be a synergistic function of membrane hydration and the percolating volume fraction of PMAA gel. Larger changes in permeation as a function of pH were achieved when both hydration and percolation effects occurred together than when either of these effects occurred on their own. Vitamin B-12 permeation was observed when the hydrated gel volume fraction was above approximately 0.38, but not below. Furthermore, the percolating fraction of composite-MPG membranes containing 28% (dry basis) PMAA gel particles was manipulated via pH to fall above (pH 7) or below (pH 3) this transition in permeability, resulting in membranes that delivered solutes of high molecular weight (vitamin B12) With large on/off delivery ratios (160).

A similar bioactive material, BioGran (OV) (Orthovita, Malvern, PA), was developed to limit the particle size of 45S5 to the range between 300 and 360 mu m, as determined by sieving. The objective of this study was to histologically and biomechanically compare the 4585 bioactive glass, produced by US Biomaterials, in a wide particle range (USB) to the narrower particle range glass produced by Orthovita (OV). The grafted defects will then be compared to normal cancellous bone (NORM) of the distal femur in rabbits. Histologically, more bone was quantified at both 4 and 12 weeks within the defects filled with USE and NORM when compared to the Limbs filled with OV (p < 0.05). The OV particles had greater particle axes and larger particle areas on average than the USE particles (p < 0.05). However, the particle axis and area of the two materials decreased with time at a similar rate. Biomechanically, the USB- and OV-grafted defects had comparable peak compressive load, compressive stiffness, and compressive modulus which were equivalent to normal bone.

After 17 h of attachment, the bacteria demonstrated an increased resistance to amikacin compared with their free-floating counterparts. Amikacin, even at a concentration exceeding 150 times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the strain tested, did not eradicate the attached bacteria from the surface of collagen membrane. However, when the drug at a high concentration (over 16 times the minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC) was present in the incubation medium before it had been inoculated with P. aeruginosa, a reduction of 2 log(10) units in the organisms adherent to the surface of collagen membrane was observed. We conclude that slow release of the antibiotic from the COLL dressing could control.ol the bacterial colonization on the surface. In fact, the released amikacin at the final concentration of 32 times the MBC reduced the number of adherent bacteria by 6 log(10) units. in contrast, ciprofloxacin at the same final bactericidal concentration completely eradicated the bacteria from the surface of COLL dressing. However, as ciprofloxacin is not recommended for use as a topical antimicrobial agent, a further search is needed to find an agent with a similar anticolonization activity.

The static contact angle data reveal that the higher hard-segment-content SPEU material possesses a lower contact angle, implying that the surface of the higher hard-segment-content SPEU is more hydrophilic than its low hard-segment-content SPEU counterpart. The catalyst- and additive-free PTMO-based SPEU materials in this study possess neither a hemolytic nor a cytotoxic response that could be considered non toxic for biomedical applications. By using L-929 cell lines, a cell-seeding test indicated that the higher hard-segment-content SPEU material possesses quicker cell attachment and proliferation behaviors. In vitro platelet adhesion tests indicated that the lower hard-segment-content SPEU possesses less platelet adhesion than the high hard-segment-content SPEU material. Both ex vivo canine artery-artery (A-A) and arterio-venous (A-V) shunting tests revealed that the extent of platelet adhesion reaction is less for lower hard-segment-content SPEU.

The human osteoblast-Like cell Line MG63 was grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) and P2O5 glass-reinforced HA composite discs and compared with the same cells grown on polystyrene culture dishes. While morphological observation at the light and electron microscopic levels showed no major deleierious effects, FCM indicated that cell size was somewhat reduced, particularly by growth on the HA composite. Moreover, this material also appeared to delay the progression of the cells from the G0/G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle. In addition to this low level of inhibition of cell growth relative to control cultures, FCM analysis also demonstrated that the glass-reinforced HA caused some down-regulation of the expression of osteocalcin and fibronectin, two antigens which play a vital part in the integrity and function of bone and soft connective tissue, respectively. These results thus show, first, that although HA and the HA composite used in these experiments were generally biocompatible, they nevertheless had certain suboptimal effects on the cells; and second, that FCM could be a highly useful procedure for effectively screening and evaluating important biological responses to implant materials.

Platelets rapidly generate thrombin when they are in the procoagulant state and the Va/Xa complex is present. We found that adherent platelets are procoagulant by three different methods: binding of FITC-Annexin V, acceleration of thrombin generation in the presence of Xa, Va, and prothrombin; and clotting of recalcified plasma. in the clotting time studies, the effect of adherent platelets on TCPS was completely eliminated by the addition of Annexin V, which is known to bind tightly to procoagulant platelets. The degree of procoagulant activity of adherent platelets was determined by measuring thrombin generation rates in the presence of the clotting factors Va, Xa, and prothrombin and normalizing to the number of adherent platelets. Two key observations were made in these studies. First, the procoagulant activity of platelets adherent to untreated and to several types of treated polystyrenes, as well as to glass and PET, was much greater than the procoagulant activity of unstimulated bulk phase platelets. Little difference in the procoagulant activity of adherent platelets was observed among the materials tested, however. Second, the procoagulant activity of platelets prestimulated with ionophore and subsequently allowed to adhere to Plastek(R) M was much greater than when adherent platelets were stimulated by the adhesion event only. Measured values for platelet adhesion, platelet activation, and contact activation of blood plasma are discussed in the context of their potential combined impact on blood clotting.

The cellular responses of attachment, spreading, and cytoskeletal organization have been studied following preadsorption of these surfaces with dilute serum, specific serum proteins, and individual components of the extracellular matrix. When preadsorbed with dilute serum, cell attachment, spreading, and cytoskeletal organization were significantly greater on hydrophilic surfaces relative to hydrophobic surfaces. Among the hydrophilic surfaces, differences in charge and wettability influenced cell attachment but not cell area, shape, or cytoskeletal organization. Moderately hydrophilic surfaces (20-40 degree water contact angle) promoted the highest levels of cell attachment. Preadsorption of the model surfaces with bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in a pattern of cell attachment very similar to that observed following preadsorption with dilute serum, suggesting an important role for BSA in regulating cell attachment to biomaterials exposed to complex biological media.

This study reports the evaluation of the in vivo tissue response to these polymers in comparison to poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). Typically, the biocompatibility of a material is determined through histological evaluations as a function of implantation time in a suitable animal model. However, due to changes that can occur in the tissue response at different stages of the degradation process, a fixed set of time points is not ideal for comparative evaluations of materials having different rates of degradation. Therefore the tissue response elicited by poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTE adipate), and PLLA was evaluated as a function of molecular weight. This allowed the tissue response to be compared at corresponding stages of degradation. Poly(DTE adipate) consistently elicited the mildest tissue response, as judged by the width and lack of cellularity of the fibrous capsule formed around the implant. The tissue response to poly(DTE carbonate) was mild throughout the 570 day study. However, the response to PLLA fluctuated as a function of the degree of degradation, exhibiting an increase in the intensity of inflammation as the implant began to lose mass. At the completion of the study, tissue ingrowth into the degrading and disintegrating poly(DTE adipate) implant was evident while no comparative ingrowth of tissue was seen far PLLA. The similarity of the in vivo and in vitro degradation rates of each polymer confirmed the absence of enzymatic involvement in the degradation process. A comparison of molecular weight retention, water uptake, and mass loss in vivo with two commonly used in vitro systems [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and simulated body fluid (SBF)] demonstrated that for the two tyrosine-derived polymers the in vivo results were equally well simulated in vitro with PBS and SBF;. However, for PLLA the in vivo results were better simulated in vitro using PBS.

Thermal shape memory, superelasticity, and high damping properties make such alloys behave differently compared to other implant metals. There has previously been a lack of sufficient evidence on the biocompatibility of Nitinol. The purpose of this study was to evaluate general soft tissue response and biocompatibility to Nitinol in vivo, and to clarify neural and perineural responses, previously unreported. Seventy-five rats were randomized into three groups. Test specimens were implanted into paravertebral muscle and near the sciatic nerve. A comparison was made between Nitinol, stainless steel, and Ti-6Al-4V. The animals were euthanized at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks after implantation. General morphologic and histologic observations were made under light microscopy Semiautomatic computerized image analysis was used to measure the encapsule membrane thickness around the implants. The muscular tissue response to Nitinol was clearly nontoxic, regardless of the time period. The overall inflammatory response to Nitinol was very similar to that of stainless steel and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. There were no necroses, granulomas, or signs of dystrophic soft tissue calcification. The immune cell response to Nitinol remained low. Only a few foreign-body giant cells were present. The detected neural and perineural responses were also clearly nontoxic and nonirritating with Nitinol. No qualitative differences in histology between the different test materials could be seen. At 8 weeks, the encapsule membrane of Nitinol was thicker than that of stainless steel (mean 62 +/- 25 mu m vs. 41 +/- 8 mu m) At the end of the study, the encapsule thickness was equal to all the materials tested. We concluded that Nitinol had good in vivo biocompatibility after intramuscular and perineural implantation in rats in the 26-week follow-up. Based on the results of the present study, Nitinol appears to have good potential for clinical use.

It was named sublancin 168, and its behavior during Edman sequence analysis and its NMR spectrum suggested that sublancin is a dehydroalanine-containing lantibiotic, A hybridization probe based on the peptide sequence was used to clone the presublancin gene, which encoded a 56-residue polypeptide consisting of a 19-residue leader segment and a 37-residue mature segment. The mature segment contained one serine, one threonine, and five cysteine residues. Alkylation of mature sublancin showed no free sulfhydryl groups, suggesting that one sulfydryl had formed a beta-methyllanthionine bridge with a dehydrobutyrine derived by posttranslational modification of threonine; with the other four cysteines forming two disulfide bridges. It is unprecedented for a lantibiotic to contain a disulfide bridge. The sublancin leader was similar to known type AII lantibiotics, containing a double-glycine motif that is typically recognized by dual-function transporters. A protein encoded immediately downstream from the sublancin gene possessed features of a dual-function ABC transporter with a proteolytic domain and an ATP-binding domain. The antimicrobial activity spectrum of sublancin was like other lantibiotics, inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria; and like the lantibiotics nisin and subtilin in its ability to inhibit both bacterial spore outgrowth and vegetative growth. Sublancin is an extraordinarily stable lantibiotic, showing no degradation or inactivation after being stored in aqueous solution at room temperature for 2 years. The fact that sublancin is a natural product of B. subtilis 168, for which a great deal of genetic information is available, including the entire sequence of its genome, suggests that sublancin will be an especially good model for studying the potential of lantibiotics as sources of novel biomaterials.","Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Hansen, JN (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI24454],,,35,149,168,0,25,AMER SOC BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY INC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0021-9258,,,J BIOL CHEM,J.

These cements consist of dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD), alpha-tricalcium phosphate, or amorphous calcium phosphate and, as an additional source of calcium, calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate. These cements require the use of a phosphate (0.2 mol l(-1) or higher) solution or a high pH solution as the cement liquid. The cements harden in relatively short time (5-30 min) and form HA as the dominant end-product in 24 h. The diametral tensile strengths of the 24-h samples are in the range of 0.2 to 7.5 MPa. Results from X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the cement setting is caused by rapid HA formation induced by the high phosphate concentration of the cement liquid. Because DCPA and DCPD are highly soluble at pH values above 12.7, which is the pK(3) of phosphoric acid, high phosphate concentration in the slurry solution was also attainable by using a highly alkaline solution as the cement liquid. The physicochemical properties of these cements are comparable to those of TTCP-containing cements, and the new cements may be expected to have in vivo characteristics similar to those of TTCP-containing cements as well.

These attractive properties were a driving force for the early introduction of alpha (cpTi) and alpha + beta (Ti-6A1-4V) alloys as well as for the more recent development of new Ti-alloy compositions and orthopaedic metastable beta titanium alloys. The later possess enhanced biocompatibility, reduced elastic modulus, and superior strain-controlled and notch fatigue resistance. However, the poor shear strength and wear resistance of titanium alloys have nevertheless limited their biomedical use. Although the wear resistance of beta-Ti alloys has shown some improvement when compared to alpha + beta alloys, the ultimate utility of orthopaedic titanium alloys as wear components will require a more complete fundamental understanding of the wear mechanisms involved. This review examines current information on the physical and mechanical characteristics of titanium alloys used in artifical joint replacement prostheses, with a special focus on those issues associated with the long-term prosthetic requirements, e.g., fatigue and wear.

The cytotoxicities of this hydrogel, two semi-occlusive polyurethane dressings (Tegaderm and OpSite), and a hydrocolloid dressing (DuoDERM) were compared by measuring cell survival with the tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT) assay after incubations of the wound dressing samples for up to 6 d, in the presence of-but not in direct contact with-the cells. In vitro, the degree of cytotoxicity of the new hydrogel was greater in keratinocyte cultures than in fibroblast and endothelial cell cultures, and increased upon longer incubation time. In keratinocyte cultures, the semi-occlusive polyurethane dressings, the hydrocolloid, and the hydrogel dressings induced low, high and acceptable degrees of cytotoxicity, respectively. The toxicity of the isolated hydrogel components was assessed in Balb MK keratinocyte cultures. In these cells, epidermal growth-factor-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA was higher in the presence of gelatin. By contrast, concentrations of dextran dialdehyde as low as 0.002% were found to significantly decrease thymidine incorporation (P < 0.01). Subcutaneous implantation studies in mice showed that in vivo the hydrogel was biocompatible since the foreign body reaction seen around the implanted hydrogel samples was moderate and became minimal upon increasing implantation time. These results indicate that dextran dialdehyde cross-linked gelatin hydrogels have an appropriate biocompatibility. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

We hypothesized that different surface compositions of stent material could result in different conditioning film depositions and potentially altered receptivity to bacterial biofilms, Using XPS, three types of ureteral stents recovered from 64 patients were found to have adsorbed conditioning films that altered the surface composition of the devices. Elements associated with encrustation (calcium, magnesium and phosphorus) were found on 69% of the silicone latex stents, 44% of the low surface energy (LSe) devices, and 38% of the carbon-rich stents, No statistical difference was found in relation to patient gender, stent type, duration of implantation, and encrustation deposition. The composition of the film suggested that the nature of the underlying material did not significantly alter the elements that adsorbed. Thus, devices may take on a similar surface coat within days, and perhaps hours, of exposure to the host. With respect to dense encrustations, fewer appeared on the LSe devices. SEM confirmed the presence and nature of the film crystals and showed bacterial biofilms adherent to devices and encrustations in three patients who had received prophylactic trimethoprim compared to one on ciprofloxacin, In conclusion, although encrustation deposition and biofilm formation on ureteral stents is not unique to Cook devices, the human model and surface science test systems described here are invaluable to evaluate biomaterials used in patients, Unless biomaterials undergo rigorous analysis in vivo, including true assessment of the outcome of prophylactic antibiotic usage, clinicians will be unable to accurately select the best device and management strategy for a given patient.

We used the avridine arthritis rat model to evaluate the tissue response in the synovial, interstitial and subcutaneous tissues after implant insertion. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that normal joint synovial tissue is dominated by ED2-positive resident macrophages. Polyethylene implants induced a much stronger foreign-body reaction than titanium implants, as measured by the number of interfacial ED1-positive macrophages. The tissue response to titanium and polyethylene was also vastly different in arthritic synovial tissue compared with control tissue. It is likely that these biomaterials interact differently with inflammatory cells or intermediary compounds. It may be that arthritic synovial tissue produces reactive oxygen intermediates (free radicals) with which titanium has a unique anti-inflammatory interaction in vitro.","Univ Lund, Lund, Sweden","Overgaard, L (reprint author), Malmo Univ Hosp, Dept Expt Res, S-20502 Malmo, Sweden.",,,,,,,29,24,25,0,2,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND WC2N 6ET",0301-620X,,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

The mandibular premolars and the Ist, 2nd and 3rd maxillary premolars were extracted. Three fixtures of the Branemark System(R) were installed in each mandibular quadrant (a total of 6 fixtures per animal). Abutment connection was performed after 3 months of healing. In each dog the following types of abutments were used: 2 ""control abutments"" (c.p. titanium), 2 ""ceramic abutments"" (highly sintered Al2O3), 1 ""gold abutment"", and 1 ""short titanium abutment"". This ""short titanium abutment"" was provided with an outer structure made of dental porcelain fused to gold. Following abutment connection a plaque control program was initiated and maintained for 6 months. The animals were sacrificed and perfused with a fixative. The mandibles were removed and each implant region was dissected, demineralized in EDTA and embedded in EPON(R). Semithin sections representing the mesial, distal, buccal and lingual aspects of the peri-implant tissues were produced and subjected to histological examination. The findings from the analysis demonstrated that the material used in the abutment portion of the implant influenced the location and the quality of the attachment that occurred between the periimplant mucosa and the implant. Abutments made of c.p. titanium or ceramic allowed the formation of a mucosal attachment which included one epithelial and one connective tissue portion that were about 2 mm and 1 - 1.5 mm high, respectively. At sites where abutments made of gold alloy or dental porcelain were used, no proper attachment formed at the abutment level, but the soft tissue margin receded and bone resorption occurred. The abutment fixture junction was hereby occasionally exposed and the mucosal barrier became established to the fixture portion of the implant. It was suggested that the observed differences were the result of varying adhesive properties of the materials studied or by variations in their resistance to corrosion.","Univ Goteborg, Inst Odontol, Dept Periodontol, SE-40530 Goteborg, Sweden; Univ Lund, Dept Prosthodont, Lund, Sweden","Abrahamsson, I (reprint author), Univ Goteborg, Inst Odontol, Dept Periodontol, Box 450, SE-40530 Goteborg, Sweden.",,,,,,,28,267,268,1,15,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0303-6979,,,J CLIN PERIODONTOL,J.

Despite the importance of the interaction between these organized assemblies and the surface of biomaterials, little is known about the mechanism involved. In this study, the interaction between giant proline-rich mussel adhesive protein (MAP) vesicles and the microporous apatite surface was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We have found that MAP vesicles incubated on the apatite surface similar to osteoclasts, induce site-specific resorption of the apatite surface. However, in contrast to the osteoclastic resorption, the vesicle-induced resorption process appears to be accompanied by an organic matrix-mediated remineralization process. This results in the formation of a variety of complex three-dimensional site-specific ""remodelled zones"" on the apatite surface of micrometre scale. The mechanism of the formation of ""remodelled zones"" is discussed in terms of surface phenomena, such as adsorption and deformation of vesicles, site-specific release of resorptive agents, organic matrix-directed remineralization, and Ca-induced fusion, collapse and reshaping of the vesicles on the apatite surface.","Queens Univ, Dept Mat & Met Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Shirkhanzadeh, M (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Mat & Met Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",,,,,,,35,1,1,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, the stents were implanted and retained for periods of between 3 and 40 days. Each patient received daily antibiotic therapy with either ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim. After removal; the devices were analyzed for adherent bacteria and encrustations. The study showed that a conditioning film became deposited onto the stents upon implantation, changing the surface characteristics of the biomaterials. Dense encrustations were found to be least on a low surface energy device. No differences were found related to patient age and gender or duration of stent insertion. Flakiness and apparent sloughing of the stent surfaces was observed in some devices, raising concerns as to what actually happens to medical devices when exposed to the host urinary tract. Bacteria were recovered from the urine of three patients and the stents of four patients treated with trimethoprim. Five stents had bacterial biofilms detected by SEM. The actual clinical end-point was not the focus of this study, but no patients became septic. Our goal was to demonstrate conclusively in humans that medical devices do develop conditioning films upon implantation, and that they can be susceptible to bacterial colonization even during antibiotic treatments. The kidneys of stented patients are clearly at risk of infection, and only by proper selection of a stent type and appropriate antibiotic coverage can this risk be significantly reduced.","Lawson Res Inst H414, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Surg, Div Urol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada","Reid, G (reprint author), Lawson Res Inst H414, 268 Grosvenor St, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada.",,,,,,,22,34,34,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0022-5347,,,J UROLOGY,J.

The present short review article shows that under normal circumstances structural 'damage' precedes the creation of a fatal macrocrack and the onset of 'failure'. The externally perceived material 'toughness' is a function of both: (i) the degree of prefailure accumulation of damage and (ii) of the properties of the final fracture surface. These two situations can be distinguished as 'pre-fracture' toughness and 'fracture toughness' and the relative contribution of each one in the overall toughness of the tissue is crucial for the final outcome of the failure process. Inevitably, materials which show remarkable toughness have to enhance their performance with respect to both the previous two defined quantities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

To date, several methods to count the number of colloidal gold labels have been employed with limited success. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), a physical method for the analysis of the elemental composition of materials, can be used to provide a quantitative index of gold accumulation in bulk specimens. Given that gold is not naturally found in biological specimens in any substantial amount and that colloidal gold and ligand conjugates can be prepared to yield uniform bead sizes, the amount of label can be calculated in bulk biological samples by INAA. Here we describe the use of INAA, LM, transmission EM, and X-ray microanalysis (EDX) in a model to determine both distribution (localization) and amount of colloidal gold at the organ, tissue, cellular, and ultrastructural levels in whole animal systems following administration. In addition, the sensitivity for gold in biological specimens by INAA is compared with that of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The correlative use of INAA, LM, TEM, and EDX can be useful, for example, in the quantitative and qualitative tracking of various labeled molecular species following administration in vivo.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anim Hlth & Biomed Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Albrecht, RM (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anim Hlth & Biomed Sci, 1656 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Hillyer, Julian/0000-0002-3178-0201",,,,41,46,47,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1431-9276,1435-8115,,MICROSC MICROANAL,Microsc. microanal.,SEP-OCT,1998.0,4,5,,,,,481,490,,10.1017/S143192769898045X,,,,10,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Microscopy",Materials Science; Microscopy,166XZ,WOS:000078604400003,,,,,2019-02-25

The patterned immobilization of EGF on the polystyrene plate was confirmed by immunostaining with an anti-EGF antibody. Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing EGF receptors were cultured on the micropatterned plate. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues of EGF receptors and signal proteins were detected only in the cells adhered in the EGF-immobilized area and cell growth was observed only in the EGF-immobilized area. The cells growing in the EGF-immobilized area were partially stained by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, when the area of EGF immobilization was smaller than the cell. The partial staining of activated proteins indicates that immobilization of the EGF inhibited the free lateral diffusion and internalization of the activated EGF/EGF-receptor complex.

Many of these products rely on the use of a cellular component co-formulated with a natural or synthetic biomaterial. At this time, though, there are no consensus safety or efficacy standards for tissue-engineered products. We describe general approaches for assessment of the safety and efficacy of cell-based tissue-engineered products which will lead to reliable medical products for human use. This article provides a general summary of the factors that should be considered in the design and development of cell- and tissue-based products. Seven areas are considered: cell and tissue sourcing; cell and tissue characterization; biomaterials testing; quality assurance; quality control; and nonclinical testing and clinical evaluation. Factors relevant to these areas have been discussed to provide a set of recommendations on which development of products can be standardized. Where relevant, the discussion has been separated in each area to issues that are independent or dependent on cell source. Also, examples are provided of how these guidelines would be applied to two product types that represent somewhat extreme ends of the spectrum for tissue engineering applications. The first example is a product whose mechanism of action is to provide locally-acting structural repair or enhancement in vivo. The second example is a product whose mechanism of action involves systemically distributed physiologically or pharmacologically active products. In general, we have limited the discussion of product types to those that are implanted into the patient for relatively long periods of time. We believe that adoption of these voluntary guidelines would lead to products that are more consistent in quality and performance as well as more rapidly developed.","Reprogenesis Inc, Cambridge, MA 01239 USA; CytoTherapeut Inc, Lincoln, RI USA; Med Commun, New Haven, CT USA; Genzyme Tissue Repair, Cambridge, MA USA; IPS, Bridgewater, NJ USA",,,,,,,,54,23,24,0,3,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,FAL,1998.0,4,3,,,,,239,266,,10.1089/ten.1998.4.239,,,,28,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,126ZC,WOS:000076324400002,9836789.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the present study, we have examined the effects of three biocements, biocement H, calcium-deficient apatite; biocement F, apatite +CaHPO4; biocement D, carbonated apatite + CaHPO4 + CaCO3 and an amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) proposed as implant fixing materials, on the growth, differentiation, and cell surface interaction of human bone marrow fibroblastic cells. These cells are known to be progenitors of osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, and reticulocytes. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, a marker of the osteoblast phenotype, was increased by a factor of two- to sixfold on carbonated apatite, one- to sixfold on apatite and three- to 10-fold on calcium-deficient apatite, over levels observed on plastic. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced. Photomicroscopic examination indicated high biocompatibility with close adhesion of the bone marrow fibroblastic cells to composites D, F, and H. Longer term marrow cultures (15 days) confirmed the stimulation of cell differentiation, as assessed by collagen production, over cell proliferation, of cells grown on carbonated apatite. Enhanced osteoblastic differentiation was observed on a 70% carbonated apatite, which has a composition similar to bone mineral, whereas cell toxicity was observed on cells grown on amorphous calcium phosphate. This in vitro human bone marrow fibroblast culture system provides a simple and effective method for the evaluation of new biomaterials.

Young's modulus of the tested biomaterial (potato tissue) increases almost three orders of magnitude as temperature is decreased below freezing. This change is not proportional to the fraction of ice formed. The relaxation of the material is initially faster as more ice is formed, an effect attributed to faster relaxation of ice. When the ice formation is complete, further lowering of temperature makes the relaxation slower; art effect attributed to temperature itself as distinct from change of phase. As the temperature lowers, more ice forms and the material behaves more brittle, decreasing the failure strains. The compressive and tensile failure strength increases with drop in temperature.

By investigation of the interactions of sensor surface-bound fibrinogen with various specific monoclonal antibodies it has been found that density, orientation, and accessibility of the individual fibrinogen domains of surface-bound fibrinogen depend on the concentration of fibrinogen in solution during the adsorption process. At low fibrinogen surface density the majority of molecules seem to be adsorbed side-on (lying on the surface). At high fibrinogen density the molecules are adsorbed end-on (standing on the surface). The experimental data suggest that the distal ends of the (adsorbed) fibrinogen molecule (containing polymerisation sites) are oriented anti-parallel to each other, proving off-axis location of the distal end domains.

Many of the difficulties could be because of problems in isolating electrochemical effects from other interactions of phase components. We explored charge effects on protein partitioning in poly(ethylene glycol)-dextran two-phase systems by using two series of genetically engineered charge modifications of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme produced in Escherichia coli. The two series, one in the form of charged-fusion tails and the other in the form of charge-change point mutations, provided matching net charges but very different polarity. Partition coefficients of both series were obtained and interfacial potential differences of the phase systems were measured. Multi-angle laser light scattering measurements were also performed to determine second virial coefficients. A semi-empirical model accounting for the roles of both charge and non-charge effects on protein partitioning behavior is proposed, and the results predicted from the model are compared to the results from the experiments.

This system also provides an opportunity to elucidate the relationship between protein-protein molecular recognition, crystallization solution conditions, and crystal properties such as coherence, space group symmetry, and morphology. A better understanding of these relationships may aid in the design of rational strategies for promoting high-quality protein crystallization and for controlling protein assembly at interfaces in the biomaterials and nanotechnology fields. Here we show that two-dimensional streptavidin crystallization is kinetically controlled and that formation of a single electrostatic interaction at the crystal contact interfaces is a key energetic determinant of the kinetic barriers controlling crystal morphology. Our results also demonstrate that this electrostatic interaction at the streptavidin protein-protein interfaces is responsible for the ionic strength dependence of streptavidin crystallization. Molecular modeling studies of the wild-type crystal that displays C222 symmetry suggested that the side-chain amines of lysine 132 from adjacent proteins interact with each other across the dyad-related crystal contacts. Leucine was substituted at this position (K132L) to remove the need for bridging counterions. Unlike wild-type streptavidin, the K132L mutant crystallizes with rectangular morphology on buffer or on a pure water subphase and analysis of the electron micrographs demonstrates that the crystal retains C222 symmetry in the presence or absence of salt. The kinetic barriers associated with formation of this electrostatic interaction thus underlie the wild-type butterfly crystal morphology.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Biol Struct, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Biomol Struct Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Stayton, PS (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Box 357962, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Vogel, Viola/O-8025-2015","Vogel, Viola/0000-0003-2898-7671",,,,28,22,23,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,AUG 18,1998.0,14,17,,,,,4683,4687,,10.1021/la9801918,,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,112GD,WOS:000075485000003,,,,,2019-02-25

Separations are often by size, ion exchange, or hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of the support, eluent and protein. Adsorption of a protein to a synthetic surface plays an essential role in this complex process. In this study, we examined the adsorption properties of three representative plasma proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulin G) on nonporous column materials containing either quaternary amine or sulfopropyl functional groups. The adsorption properties were studied at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. Salt gradients were used to examine the adsorption/desorption properties of each of the proteins on each type of surface. The salt concentrations at desorption were measured and compared to the protein isoelectric points. In addition, we examined protein recoveries as a function of desorption time. Our results suggest that protein recoveries depend not only on the protein, eluent and surface, but also the residence time and overall charge concentration during the initial adsorption process. Finally, we correlated the number of charge sites on a molecule with the width of a chromatographic band at half height. The data produced as a result of this study may be used to determine the actual unfolding time of a protein, given a certain set of conditions. The data may also help in understanding the chemistry and dynamics of the protein adsorption processes in ion-exchange chromatography as well as provide key structural information about the proteins.

The incorporation of achiral units into collagen-like structures is of considerable interest for the structural simplification of collagen-like biomaterials. The achiral unit Gly-Nleu-Nleu (where Nleu represents N-isobutylglycine) was positioned between Gly-Pro-Hyp trimeric repeats in collagen-like structures in order to examine the effect of an achiral block on triple helicity. A series of single chain structures, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(n)-(Gly-Pro-Kyp)(n)-NH2 (where n = 1-3), and a template-assembled structure, KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(2)-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-NH2](3) (where KTA represents cis,cis-1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid), were investigated. Biophysical studies were carried out in both H2O and ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O (2:1, v/v) solvents, using circular dichroism and optical rotation measurements. Highly cooperative melting curves from optical rotation determinations were obtained for Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n)-(Gly-Nleu-Nieu)(n)- (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n)-NH2 (n = 2, 3) and KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(2)-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-NH2](3), revealing that the achiral trimer can participate in triple helical structures. These results were also supported by circular dichroism spectroscopy. For the molecules Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(3)(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 and KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(2)-NH2](3), the presence of collagen-like structures was also supported by H-1 NMR spectroscopy in H2O. For each structure, a distinct set of resonances, obtained at low temperature, disappeared once a thermal denaturation temperature was reached. Furthermore, the analysis of NOE cross-peaks established the close packing of Pro, Hyp, and Nleu. The spatial proximity of Pro and Nleu residues and of Hyp and Nleu residues belonging to different chains was confirmed by molecular modeling of triple helical AC-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(3)-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 .","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biochem & Chem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Goodman, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biochem & Chem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,38,27,27,2,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Thin HA films up to 1 mu m thick were deposited on silicon wafers coated either with borophosphate silicate glass (BPSG) or titanium films, dried and then fired. Increasing the drying temperature raised the firing temperature for initial formation of crystalline HA. It was found that at firing temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 degrees C, the dominant phase in the powders was HA with small amounts of calcium oxide and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP).

The implantation of polymer/cell constructs combines concepts of biomaterials and cell transplantation. The interconnections between the host responses to the biomaterial and transplanted cells determines the biocompatibility of the device. This review describes the inflammatory response to the biomaterial component and immune response towards transplanted cells. Emphasis is on how the presence of the transplanted cell construct affects the host response. The inflammatory response towards a biomaterial can impact the immune response towards transplanted cells and vice versa. Immune rejection is the most important host response towards the cellular component of tissue engineered devices containing allogeneic, xenogeneic or immunogenic ex vivo manipulated autologous cells. The immune mechanisms towards allografts and xenografts are outlined to provide a basis for the mechanistic hypotheses of the immune response towards encapsulated cells, with antigen shedding and the indirect pathway of antigen presentation predominating. A review of experimental evidence illustrates examples of the inflammatory response towards biodegradable polymer scaffold materials, examples of devices appropriately integrated as assessed morphologically with the host for various applications including bone, nerve, and skin regeneration, and of the immune response towards encapsulated allogeneic and xenogeneic cells.

Thrombin, which is responsible for thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell activation, has been the target of numerous surface modification strategies in an effort to prevent this phenomenon from occurring. The purpose of this study was to covalently immobilize the potent, specific antithrombin agent recombinant hirudin (rHir) onto a novel polyurethane polymer synthesized with carboxylic acid groups which served as protein attachment sites. The in vitro efficacy of thrombin inhibition by this novel biomaterial surface was then evaluated. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was selected as the basecoat protein, was reacted with sulfo-SMCC in a 1:50 molar ratio. This BSA-SMCC complex was then covalently linked to the carboxylated polyurethane (cPU) surface via the crosslinker EDC (cPU-BSA-SMCC). This cPU-BSA-SMCC surface was then reacted with Traut's-modified I-125-rHir, a procedure which created free sulfhydryl groups on rHir (cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir). Using these crosslinking procedures, the cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir segments bound 188 +/- 40 ng/cm(2) (n = 60) whereas the controls with non-specifically bound I-125-rHir (Mitrathan + EDC + BSA + I-125-rHir-SH and cPU-BSA + I-125-rHir-SH) bound 13 +/- 8 ng/cm(2) and 4 +/- 8 ng/cm(2), respectively. Evaluation of these cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir segments for I-131-thrombin inhibition using a chromogenic assay for thrombin showed that a maximum of 2.64 NIHU thrombin was inhibited in contrast to the controls which inhibited 0.76 and 0.70 NIHU. Controls with nonspecifically bound I-125-rHir also had 0.31 and 0.76 NIHU I-131-thrombin adherent to their respective surfaces whereas the maximum I-131-thrombin binding to the cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments was 1.51 NIHU. Exposure to I-131-thrombin did not result in any release of covalently bound I-125-rHir from the cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir segments. Thus, these results demonstrate that rHir can be covalently bound to this novel polyurethane surface and still maintain potent antithrombin activity.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; CardioTech Int Inc, Woburn, MA 01801 USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Boston, MA USA","Phaneuf, MD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, W Campus,4 Blackfan Circle,Harvard Inst Med Bldg, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,"Berceli, Scott/0000-0003-2257-0111",NHLBI NIH HHS [1 R43 HL53856-01A1],,,24,31,31,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0160-564X,1525-1594,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

The collagen fibers were succinylated. Hydrogel produced with the succinylated collagen was used for the sealant to reduce the amount of solid substance. To avoid contamination and the side effects of chemical reagents, the collagen thermally crosslinked under sterile conditions. A suspension of the collagen fibers was enmeshed in the interstices of Dacron fibers of fabric prostheses, which were then thermally crosslinked at 130 degrees C for 20 h. The prostheses were porous when the collagen fiber network was dry. Under wet conditions, however, the water permeability of the grafts was reduced to 0.1 ml/min from the 1,250 ml/min of the original prostheses. Three weeks after implantation in the abdominal aortas of dogs, 81.2 +/- 11% of the luminal surface was macroscopically thrombus free, and 56 +/- 14% was endothelialized. More than 95% of the coated collagen had been absorbed. Numerous fibroblasts had migrated into the graft walls, and capillary blood vessels had infiltrated the inside of the graft walls without foreign body reaction. In the controls, thrombus free areas averaged 9.0 +/- 5%, and endothelialized areas averaged 5.2 +/- 4%. Many giant cells, plasma cells, and lymphocytes had migrated into the graft wails, but no fibroblasts.

Design A prospective trial of 11 dogs with single congenital extrahepatic shunts. Procedure Rectal ammonia tolerance testing and routine biochemical tests were performed preoperatively on all dogs. In seven dogs, preoperative abdominal Doppler ultrasonography was also performed. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a single extrahepatic portocaval shunt in each animal, which was attenuated using a cellophane band with an internal diameter of 2 to 3 mm. The abdomen was closed routinely. Follow-up biochemical analysis and abdominal Doppler ultrasonography or splenoportography were performed postoperatively. Results The shunt was not amenable to total ligation in 11 dogs, based upon reported criteria. All dogs recovered uneventfully from surgery without evidence of portal hypertension, and showed clinical improvement thereafter. Shunt occlusion was deemed to have occurred in 10 dogs based on resolution of biochemical and/or sonographic abnormalities. One dog continued to have sonographic evidence of portosystemic shunting when evaluated 3 weeks after surgery, despite normal ammonia tolerance, but was lost to subsequent follow-up. Two dogs, in which 3 mm cellophane bands were placed, experienced delayed shunt occlusion. Conclusion Cellophane banding is simple to perform, and causes progressive attenuation of single extrahepatic shunts in dogs. Further work is needed to determine the maximum diameter of a cellophane band which will produce total attenuation, and the long-term safety and reliability of the treatment.","Univ Sydney, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Vet Cardiovasc Unit, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Hunt, GB (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Vet Cardiovasc Unit, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,,,,,27,50,51,1,10,AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY ASSN,MELBOURNE,"272 BRUNSWICK RD BRUNSWICK, MELBOURNE, VIC 3056, AUSTRALIA",0005-0423,,,AUST VET J,Aust.

The range of possible composite biomaterials is reviewed, together with the possible methods of fabrication and the limitations that these place on the design of composite components. The use of composite materials allows many new design possibilities, but this freedom of design requires a clearer understanding of the objectives and constraints on the design process. The testing of composite components also presents many challenging problems, which are not adequately addressed by existing standards developed for testing conventional monolithic materials. The interaction of composite materials with the body is more complex than that of the component materials, and the prediction of their long-term mechanical performance also presents many intractable difficulties. However, despite these challenges composite materials are likely to prove invaluable in the future development of orthopaedics. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The inability of the nerves to regenerate spontaneously and the limitations of autograft procedures led to the development of treatments involving insertion of the nerve ends into prosthetic tubular devices. Previous work showed that 'entubulation' of the nerve ends in a silicone tube containing a specific porous, resorbable collagen-GAG (CG) copolymer, serving as an analog of extracellular matrix, improved regeneration compared to an empty silicone tube. However, long-term treatment with silicone tubes produced constriction that caused partial degradation of the regenerated axons; for this and other reasons, implementation of a nondegradable tube may require a second surgical procedure for removal. In this study the silicone tube was replaced with porous and non-porous collagen tubes in order to produce fully degradable devices. CG-filled collagen tubes and controls (CG-filled silicone tubes and empty collagen and silicone tubes) were implanted in a 10-mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve, with three rats in each group. The regeneration was evaluated after six weeks using light microscope images of cross sections of the nerve that were digitized and analyzed. Histograms of the diameters of the axons were generated and compared. The cellular response to the implanted biomaterials was assessed histologically, and immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody to alpha-smooth muscle actin in order to determine the presence of myofibroblasts (contractile cells). Axonal regrowth was comparable in porous collagen, non-porous collagen, and silicone tubes filled with a CG matrix. These results support the implementation of a degradable collagen tube in place of a silicone device. Confirming earlier work, regeneration through the silicone and collagen tubes was enhanced by the CG copolymer, compared to empty tubes. A notable finding was a continuous layer of myofibroblasts on the surfaces of all of the six silicone tube prostheses, but on the inner surface of only one of six collagen tubes (Fisher's exact tests; P < 0.01), This is the first report of contractile capsules around silicone tubes, and supports the use of degradable collagen tubes in peripheral nerve regeneration, Macrophages were found bordering both the silicone and collagen tubes, and in the case of the collagen tubes, appeared to be participating in the regulation of the tubes.

On that basis, selective adhesion of different types of mammalian cells (PC12 pheochromocytoma, MSC80 schwannoma, Hep G2 hepatoblastoma, rat hepatocytes) on patterned surfaces was achieved. Therefore tracks (width in the range of a few tens of Irm) of reduced hydrophobicity were produced on polystyrene by photolithography and oxygen plasma treatment.

However, loss of function may occur owing to tissue reactions, which are mainly caused by a variety of inflammatory reactions. Recently, we demonstrated that macrophages (MO) and T cells play key roles in these reactions. Since immunological studies showed that the T cell-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates MO, the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of modulating tissue reactions to biodegradable biomaterials by inactivating IFN-gamma. Dermal sheep collagen (DSC) was used as a test biomaterial. DSC impregnated with anti-IFN-gamma or phosphate-buffered saline (control) was implanted in rats. The results showed that cellular ingrowth and formation and function of giant cells were strongly delayed by anti-IFN-gamma. Also, MHC class II expression was strongly inhibited. In the treated DSC, some huge giant cells were formed at the interface but association with the DSC bundles did not occur. Finally, in both the control and treated DSC, T cells and NK cells were rarely detected. This study demonstrates that IFN-gamma plays an important role in the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials. This reaction can be modulated by anti-IFN-gamma, which warrants further studies of anti-IFN-gamma for clinical application to prevent unwanted tissue reactions to biomaterials.

The secondary and tertiary structures of KA give it very important and unique viscoelastic properties. HA-composed materials are currently used intraocularly during ophthalmological surgery to facilitate surgical procedures and prevent tissue damage. To examine the effects of three viscous biomaterials composed of hyaluronan (Healon(TM), IAL(TM), and Biolon(TM)) used in ophthalmological surgery, the membrane electrical properties of the erythroleukemic K562 cell line exposed to these materials were investigated. Membrane conductivity, membrane permittivity, and the conductivity of the cytosol were evaluated using dielectric relaxation measurements in the radiofrequency range and fitting the experimental results to the general equations of the Maxwell-Wagner effect. The results demonstrate that while membrane permittivity and the conductivity of the cytosol are not significantly altered, the membrane conductivity of K562 cells exposed to all three biomaterials increases substantially and in a time-dependent manner with respect to untreated cells. These observations seem to indicate that hyaluronan perturbs ionic transport while it does not vary the type, quantity, or distribution of membrane components. In addition, the variations induced by these substances on the cell membrane are not dependent upon the molecular weight or on the biological origin of hyaluronan. These results may aid in elucidating the mechanisms involved in hyaluronan/cell membrane interaction and thus may provide a deeper understanding of the complications related to their use in ophthalmological surgery.

However, a direct correlation between complement activation and inflammatory responses to biomaterial surfaces has yet to be established. Using an animal implantation model and gold surfaces bearing various thiol-linked functionalities, we investigated the potency of different surface groups in prompting complement activation in vitro and surface-mediated accumulation of inflammatory cells in vivo. Among the surfaces tested, mercaptoglycerol- and mercaptoethanol-bearing surfaces engendered the strongest inflammatory responses, as reflected by the accumulation of large numbers of adherent neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. In contrast, L-cysteine-coated surfaces caused only minor inflammatory responses, and both glutathione-modified and untreated gold implants attracted minimal numbers of inflammatory cells. The accumulation of inflammatory cells on mercaptoglycerol surfaces appears to arise from surface-mediated complement activation because complement-depleted animals failed to exhibit inflammatory responses to mercaptoglycerol-modified implants. Furthermore, there is a close relationship between surface-mediated complement activation (as measured by in vitro iC3b/C5b-9 generation and C3 deposition) and in vivo inflammatory responses. At least in this animal model and with these model surfaces, our results indicate that surface-mediated complement activation can be responsible for the subsequent accumulation of inflammatory cells on implant surfaces.

The object of this research was to explore the potentiality of the brazed titanium for biomaterials. The characteristics of the 1300 degrees C heat-treated and the 970 degrees C brazed specimens, with passivation and sterilization treatment, were evaluated by measurement of corrosion potential, E-corr, corrosion current densities, I-corr, polarization resistance of the reacted surface films, R-p, in a potentiodynamic test. The experimental results show that the corrosion rates of the heat-treated and the brazed samples are similar at E-corr, and the value of E-corr for the brazed sample is noble to the heat-treated samples. The passive current density of the brazed specimen is either lower or higher than the heat-treated specimen, depending on the polarization potential. By Auger electron spectroscopic and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis on specimens from the potentiostatic test, the elements of copper and nickel in the brazing filler were not detected while less alu mina was found in the reacted film of the brazed specimens when compared with the heat-treated specimens.

The unsaturated surfactant sodium 10-undecenoate [C11(:)] and the saturated surfactant sodium dodecanoate(C12) were immobilized on poly(ethylene) (PE), poly(propylene) (PP), and poly(cis-butadiene) (PB) surfaces. This was accomplished by treating polymeric substrates that were coated with C11(:) or C12 with an argon plasma. Derivatization X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Static Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SSIMS) showed that during the plasma treatment surfactants were covalently coupled to the polymeric surfaces. The chemical structure of both the surfactant and the polymeric substrate influenced the immobilization efficiency. At an optimal treatment time of 5 s, about 28 and 6% of the initial amount of carboxylate groups in the precoated C11(:) and C12 layer, respectively, was retained at the PE surface. The immobilization efficiencies of C11(:) and C12 on PP were about 20 and 9%, respectively. The immobilization efficiency of C11(:) and C12 on PB were both about 7%. The results obtained in this study indicate that the immobilization proceeds via a radical mechanism.

These polymers degrade by bulk hydrolysis of ester bonds and break down into their constituent monomers, lactic and glycolic acids which sire excreted from the body. The purpose of this investigation was to develop and characterize a biodegradable, implantable delivery system containing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (HCl) for the localized treatment of osteomyelitis and to study the extent of drug penetration from the site of implantation into the bone. Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory bone disease caused by pyogenic bacteria and involves the medullary cavity, cortex and periosteum. The advantages of localized biodegradable therapy include high, local antibiotic concentration at the site of infection, as well as, obviation of the need for removal of the implant after treatment. PLGA 50:50 implants were compressed from microcapsules prepared by nonsolvent-induced phase-separation using two solvent-nonsolvent systems, viz., methylene chloride-hexane (non-polar) and acetone-phosphate buffer (polar). In vitro dissolution studies were performed to study the effect of manufacturing procedure, drug loading and pH on the release of ciprofloxacin HCl. The extent of penetration of the drug from the site of implantation was studied using a rabbit model. The results of in vitro studies illustrated that drug release from implants made by;he nonpolar method was more rapid as compared to implants made by the polar method. The release of ciprofloxacin HCl from the implants was biphasic at less than or equal to 20% w/w drug loading, and monophasic at drug loading levels greater than or equal to 35% w/w. In vivo studies indicated that PLGA 50:50 implants were almost completely resorbed within five to six weeks. Sustained drug levels,:greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, up to 70 mm from the site of implantation, were detected for a period of six weeks.

The mechanisms involved in such acute inflammatory responses can be arbitrarily divided into phagocyte transmigration, chemotaxis, and adhesion to implant surfaces. We earlier observed that two chemokines-macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-and the phagocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)/surface fibrinogen interaction are, respectively, required for phagocyte chemotaxis and adherence to biomaterial surfaces, However, it is still not clear how the initial transmigration of phagocytes through the endothelial barrier into the area of the implant is triggered, Because implanted biomaterials elicit histaminic responses in the surrounding tissue, and histamine release is known to promote rapid diapedesis of inflammatory cells, we evaluated the possible role of histamine and mast cells in the recruitment of phagocytes to biomaterial implants. Using i.p. and s.c. implantation of polyethylene terephthalate disks in mice,ve find: (i) Extensive degranulation of mast cells, accompanied by histamine release, occurs adjacent to short-term i.p. implants. (ii) Simultaneous administration of H1 and H2 histamine receptor antagonists (pyrilamine and famotidine, respectively) greatly diminishes recruitment and adhesion of both neutrophils (<20% of control) and monocytes/macrophages (<30% of control) to implants. (iii) Congenitally mast cell-deficient mice also exhibit markedly reduced accumulation of phagocytes on both i.p. and s.c. implants, (iv) Finally, mast cell reconstitution of mast cell-deficient mice restores ""normal"" inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants. We conclude that mast cells and their granular products, especially histamine, are important in recruitment of inflammatory cells to biomaterial implants. Improved knowledge of such responses map permit purposeful modulation of both acute and chronic inflammation affecting implanted biomaterials.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Albany Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA","Tang, LP (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ltang@neo.bcm.tmc.edu,,,,,,73,144,149,0,9,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Late-onset deep-seated prosthetic infection can be an unexpected complication. METHODS: The literature from a Medline search relating to the biology of mesh in the setting of hernia repair is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a foreign body for hernia repair does not appear to alter the incidence of superficial wound infection.

The response of two polyurethanes of differing primary structure to parameters of blood compatibility has now been investigated, using an in vitro test cell. Platelet (beta-thromboglobulin) release, complement (C3a) activation, the activation of free plasma and surface-bound factor XII were studied using fresh, human blood (no anticoagulant) or citrated plasma in control and surface-modified polyurethane. Surface modifications were designed to affect material thrombogenicity and included covalent attachment of heparin, taurine, a platelet membrane glycoprotein fragment, polyethylene oxide (PEO), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and glucose or glucosamine. Unmodified control polyurethanes caused platelet release and complement activation. High molecular weight (2000 D) polyethylene oxide reduced platelet release slightly but only glucose attachment to the surface produced a significant reduction in platelet activation All modifications reduced C3 activation compared with controls, but the greatest reduction was achieved with polyethylene oxide attachment or glycosylation. Most surface modifications were more activating of factor XII, both in plasma and on the material surfaces, than the control polyurethanes. Heparin and high molecular weight PEO produced the greatest activation of factor XII in the free plasma form, but low molecular weight PEO and glucosamine produced the greatest activation of surface-bound factor XIIa. The least activating surfaces, affecting both free plasma and surface-bound factor XIIa, were those treated with platelet membrane glycoprotein fragment and glucose. PEO surfaces performed relatively well, compared with controls and most surface modifications. The best overall surface, however, was the glucose-modified surface which was least activating considering all parameters of blood compatibility. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

With radiation susceptible PSf, only proper selection of the UV energy (lambda > 350 nm; for selective excitation of the photoinitiator) yielded membranes with preserved UF barrier layer. Possibilities for adjusting structure and morphology of the graft polymer (g-PAA) layer by variation of functionalization parameters such as AA concentration and UV irradiation time were investigated. Very long grafted chains (M-W > 10(5) g mol(-1)) at varied grafting density (GD = 0.01 ... 1.2 nmol cm(-2), relative to the outer surface area) were obtained. Partial penetration of the UF barrier layer by g-PAA was verified. Covalent immobilization of bovine serum albumin (BSA), gamma-globulin (gamma-Gl) and alkaline phosphatase (APh) was achieved by coupling with a water soluble carbodiimide. Bound BSA and gamma-Gl amounts were up to Gamma = 10 mu g cm(-2), for membranes accessible only from the outer surface thus not using the entire pore volume. Locally addressed covalent protein immobilization after photo-patterning the PSf surface could be visualized with a fluorescent FITC-BSA conjugate. A strong salt effect onto immobilized APh activity (increase with NaCl concentration) was observed, indicating internal transport/accessibility limitations in the g-PAA layer, Correlations between PAA structure (M-w, GD) and accessibility (from BSA or gamma-Gl binding and APh activity) could be established. The 'tentacle' g-PAA functionalized PSf UF membranes having preserved UF barrier and, e.g., with surface-bound receptors will find application in cell cultures under diffusion or perfusion conditions.

We have further investigated these PolyHEMA hydrogels and their potential to bridge CNS injury sites, Collagen IV-impregnated hydrogels containing Schwann cells were implanted into the lesioned optic tract in 14 rats, On examination 2-4 months later, there was good adherence between the implants and CNS tissue, and large numbers of viable Schwann cells (S100(+), GFAP(+), Laminin(+), and LNGFR(+)) were seen within the hydrogel matrices. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the collagen IV-impregnated PolyHEMA hydrogels preferentially supported the transplanted Schwann cells and not host glial cells such as astrocytes (GFAP(+)) or oligodendroglia (CAII(+)), Macrophages (ED1(+)) were also seen within the sponge structure. Eighty-three percent of the implanted hydrogels contained RT97(+) axons within their trabecular networks, Regrowing axons were associated with the transplanted Schwann cells and not with the small number of infiltrating astrocytes, RT97(+) axons were traced up to 510 pm from the nearest host neuropil, These axons were sometimes myelinated by the transplanted Schwann cells and expressed the peripheral myelin marker Po+. WGA/HRP-labeled retinal axons were seen within transplanted hydrogel sponges, with 40% of the cases growing for distances up to 350-450 mu m within the polymer network. The data indicate that impregnating PolyHEMA sponges with collagen IV can modify the host glial reaction and support the survival of transplanted Schwann cells. This study thus provides new information on how biomaterials could be used to modify and bridge CNS injury sites.

Therefore, surgical repair using different prosthetic biomaterials is becoming increasingly popular. Further to favourable results by French hernia surgeons, we studied the results of underlay prosthetic mesh repair using polypropylene mesh in complicated and recurrent incisional hernias. Method: After preparation and excision of the entire hernia sac, the posterior rectus sheath is freed from the muscle bellies on both sides. The peritoneum and posterior rectus sheaths are closed with a continuous looped polyglyconate suture. The prosthesis used for midline hernias is positioned on the posterior rectus sheath and extends far beyond the borders of the myoaponeurotic defect. The anterior rectus sheath is closed with a continuous suture. The prosthesis for lumbar and subcostal hernias is placed in a prepared space between the transverse and oblique muscles. Intraperitoneal placement of the mesh must be avoided. Results: Between January 1996 and August 1997 we performed a total of 33 incisional hernia repairs (14 primary hernias, 19 recurrent hernias) using this technique (16 women, 17 men, mean age 56.19 +/- 12.92 years). Local complications occurred in four patients (12%): superficial wound infection (n = 2), postoperative bleeding, requiring reoperation (n = 1), minor hemato-seroma (n = 1). One patient suddenly died on the 3rd post-operative day from severe pulmonary embolism (mortality 3%). Twenty-two patients with a minimum follow up to 6 months were re-examined clinically. The average follow-up time for this group was 9 months (range 6-17 months). To date no recurrent hernias have been observed. There were only minor complaints like ""a feeling of tension"" in the abdominal wall (n = 3) and slight pain under physical stress (n = 6). Conclusions: The use of prosthetic mesh should be considered for repair of large or recurrent incisional hernias, especially in high-risk patients (obesity, obstructive lung disease) and complicated hernias. The aforementioned technique of underlay prosthetic repair using polypropylene mesh fixed onto the posterior rectus sheath allows for anatomical and consolidated reconstruction of the damaged abdominal wall with excellent results and low complication rates.","Univ Munich, Klinikum Innenstadt, Chirurg Klin & Poliklin, D-80336 Munich, Germany","Trupka, AW (reprint author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Innenstadt, Chirurg Klin & Poliklin, Nussbaumstr 20, D-80336 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,31,17,17,0,1,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0009-4722,,,CHIRURG,Chirurg,JUL,1998.0,69,7,,,,,766,772,,10.1007/s001040050488,,,,7,Surgery,Surgery,103QW,WOS:000074970200011,9738226.0,,,,2019-02-25

Potential damage has not the same explanation under different conditions of cold exposure. Even a moderate decrease of temperature leads to irreversible damage when applied to untreated organismes. Deep freezing injuries are due to crystallization of ice, and cellular consequences are quite different according to the temperature kinetics. The fraction survival, as a function of hypothermic kinetics, has a bimodal distribution, reflecting two distinct mechanisms : a first process, concomitant of a slow cooling rate, with extracellular ice formation, and a second one, during fast cooling rates, with intracellular ice formation. Thereby, cryopreservation protocols have to focus on many variable factors, including choices of a cryoprotectant, which delays ice formation, and a cooling rate leading to an optimal cell survival, Under these conditions, osmotic effects are almost neutralized. Nevertheless, these methods can be applied only to isolated cells. For tissues or organs, ice formation should be avoided at low temperatures. Vitrification is the corresponding process by which tissue water is undercooled to the glass transition temperature and solidified into the amorphous or glassy state. Very high cooling and warming rates are needed, The use of an appropriate cryoprotective agent mixture, called a <<vitrification solution>> should be useful : however, high-concentration vitrification solutions have still undesired toxic effects. Finally, an optimal cryoprotectant, in terms of cooling/warming rates and toxicity has to be found.","Hop Lapeyronie, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France","Vannereau, H (reprint author), Hop Lapeyronie, 371 Av Doyen Gaston Giraud, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,0,1,2,0,2,FERTIL-STERIL-CONTRACEPTION,PARIS,"55 RUE DES PETITS CHAMPS, 75001 PARIS, FRANCE",1157-8181,,,CONTRACEPT FERTIL S,Contracept.

Immobilization techniques for collagen and hydroxyapatite Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2), the main components contacting an implant within the human body, were tested. The oxide layers were created by electrochemical polarization in phosphate buffer solutions. The thickness of the layers depended on the formation potential. We found a thickness/potential relation of approximately 2.2 nm/V. At formation potentials up to 80 V anatase was the only titanium dioxide modification traceable by Raman spectroscopy and XRD. The electrochemically assisted deposition of hydroxyapatite on these surfaces starts with an amorphous product which can be monitored by SEM, IR and Raman spectroscopy. The immobilization of collagen followed by anodic electrochemical polarization results either in partial integration of collagen fibrils into the oxide layer or at least in a strong increase-of the interaction force between TiO2 and the collagen fibrils.","Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Werkstoffwissensch, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","Born, R (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Werkstoffwissensch, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",,"Born, Rene/D-8798-2011; Scharnweber, Dieter/B-3382-2010","Born, Rene/0000-0001-6793-2273; ",,,,37,33,33,0,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0937-0633,,,FRESEN J ANAL CHEM,Fresenius J.

Quantitative recoveries of total mercury were achieved with a two-step microwave attack using a combination of HNO3 and H2O2 solutions as extractant. The whole pretreatment procedure only takes 15 min, which can be further shortened by an automated robust operation with an open focused system.

Human plasma fibronectin (HPF) is an important matrix glycoprotein that mediates cell and protein attachment to each other or to the extracellular matrix present during wound healing. The objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption of HPF onto polished commercially pure titanium (cpTi) by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and to measure the resultant surface contact angle before and after HPF binding. Two types of cpTi disks, one highly polished in our laboratory (HSS) and one commercially prepared (31), were reacted with HPF solutions of varying concentrations (1 mu g/mL-10 ng/mL). ESCA survey spectra of samples coated with 1 mu g/mL of fibronectin showed an increase in organic nitrogen and carbon compared with uncoated controls. Contact angle measurements of HSS and 31 cpTi disks showed no significant difference in average contact angle (36.3 degrees +/- 3.5 and 39.1 degrees +/- 3.1) despite differences in local root mean square (RMS) surface roughness (4.45 +/- 0.46 nm and 22.37 +/- 4.17 nm) as measured by AFM. Images obtained by AFM showed that 31 specimens were more irregular, with large parallel polishing grooves. Adsorbed HPF appeared in a globular form with an average length of 16.5 +/- 1.0 nm, a height of 2.5 +/- 0.5 nm, and a width of 9.6 +/- 1.2 nm. Fibronectin coating on both HSS and 31 cpTi specimens resulted in a significant increase in hydrophobicity compared to uncoated specimens. These results indicate the significance of HPF on cpTi and may explain how cyTi implants function in situ.

Both standard leads and surface-modified leads were used. The surface modification technique was applied to achieve controlled release of the antibiotic gentamicin. The insulating polyurethane tubing material of the leads was provided with an acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymer surface graft and then loaded with gentamicin. Implantation periods varied from day 4, to week 3 1/2, to week 10. We investigated tissue reactions in the absence of an infectious challenge and also the efficacy of surface-modified leads in preventing infection after challenge with Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. It was demonstrated that the applied surface modification did not induce adverse effects although during early postimplantation an increase in infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages and wound fluid and fibrin deposition were observed. After bacterial challenge, standard leads were heavily infected at each explantation period, denoted by abscesses, cellular debris, and bacterial colonies. Ln contrast, little or no infection was observed, either macroscopically or by bacterial cultures, with the surface-modified leads. Microscopy showed little evidence of the bacterial challenge, and that primarily at day 4. It was concluded that the applied surface modification demonstrated enhanced infection resistance and thus represents a sound approach to the battle against infectious complications with biomaterials.

However, their equiatomic composition (50 wt% Ni) is controversial, and concerns have been raised about their biocompatibility level because of the carcinogenicity potential. The relative in vitro genotoxicity of NiTi therefore was evaluated and compared to commercially pure titanium (cpTi), 316L stainless steel (SS 316L), and positive and negative controls. To do so, human peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in semiphysiological medium that previously had been exposed to the biomaterials. The electron microscopy in situ end-labeling (EM-ISEL) assay then was performed in order to provide quantification of in vitro chromatin DNA single-stranded breaks (SSBs). Chromosomes and nuclei were harvested and exposed to exonuclease III, which amplifies DNA lesions at 3' ends of breaks. After random priming, incorporation of biotin-dUTP was labeled by immunogold binding, which then was detected using electron microscopy. Cellular chromatin exposed to the positive control demonstrated a significantly stronger immunogold labeling than when it was exposed to NiTi, cpTi, SS 316L extracts, or the untreated control. Moreover, gold particle counts, whether in the presence of NiTi, cpTi, or the negative control medium, were not statistically different. NiTi genocompatibility therefore presents promising prescreening results towards its biocompatibility approval.

This paper reports on the application of FT-IX microspectroscopy (FT-IRM) for the investigation of inorganic and organic phases of the rough composite and separated phases obtained by mechanical or chemical extraction methods. A comparison of FT-IRM with the conventional KBr pellet method was made and indicates that the macro and micro FT-IR methods are complementary: the former revealed new chemical groups not visualized with the KBr method whereas the latter detected the major compound of the blend. FT-IR microspectroscopy was revealed to be a powerful method of analysis that is complementary to other existing spectroscopic methods. Moreover, it is expected to be a useful tool in the study of biomaterials in biological samples.

The flow cell is used to conduct an investigation into the in vitro generation of C3a by a regenerated cellulose membrane, Cuprophan. The effects of experimental variables such as temperature, blood flow rate, contact area and wall shear rate on C3a generation by Cuprophan were studied. The results show that C3a generation by Cuprophan is lower at 12 degrees C than at 22 degrees C, which is in turn lower than C3a generation at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, a decrease in contact area, and increase in wall shear rate and blood flow rate, can produce a decrease in C3a concentration.","Univ Strathclyde, Bioengn Unit, Glasgow G4 ONW, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Glasgow, Glasgow Royal Infirm, Dept Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Lamba, NMK (reprint author), Univ Strathclyde, Bioengn Unit, Glasgow G4 ONW, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,22,4,4,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Modern organosilicon chemistry, based in part on the artificial silicon-carbon bond, coincided with the emergence of the biomaterials and bioengineering fields fifty years ago, and was thought to be a fortunate coincidence according to conventional wisdom that high-molecular-weight polymeric siloxanes were chemically and biologically inert. These concepts have been challenged by reports of silicone migration and degradation following insertion of gel-filled breast implants, claims of a novel systemic illness appearing in many breast implant recipients, and investigations implicating varied and permeating immunotoxic mechanisms of disease causation by breast devices. The present study develops additional potential pathogenetic ideas based on alterations of cell biochemistry by silicon-containing compounds, and offers correlation of the patients' diverse clinical features with plausable disruption of basic biological processes. This in turn raises new questions concerning everyday environmental exposure, has broad implications for multiple other diseases, can provide alternative directions for future investigative research, and may contribute to the ongoing redefinition of immune dysfunction and inflammation.","Monmouth Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, Long Branch, NJ USA","Brawer, AE (reprint author), 170 Morris Ave, Long Branch, NJ 07740 USA.",,,,,,,46,4,4,1,3,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0306-9877,1532-2777,,MED HYPOTHESES,Med.

In recent years, significant advances have been made both in the theoretical and experimental areas of contact mechanics, especially in the area of soft solids, in relating the contact deformation to interfacial adhesion. On the theoretical front, new theories of contact mechanics have been developed to relate the interfacial force induced deformation to the thermodynamic work of adhesion both for elastic and viscoelastic solids. On the experimental front, several new techniques have been developed to measure the interfacial forces and the interfacial-force-induced deformations. These techniques have been used, with the aid of the theories of contact mechanics, to measure directly the surface and interfacial energies of a. variety of polymers and other model surfaces. These experimental and theoretical developments have also been exploited to measure quantitatively the effect of interfacial chain diffusion on the adhesion of polymer inter-faces. We summarize the recent developments in the theories of contact mechanics, and their applications in the design and interpretation of experimental measurement of molecular level adhesion between elastomers, glassy and viscoelastic polymers. We also review the experimental and theoretical developments related to the role of chain diffusion on interfacial adhesion. Finally, we identify some potential new applications of contact-mechanics-based techniques in such emerging area of adhesion science as molecular level studies of adhesion of viscoelastic materials and biomaterials.","3M Adhes Div, Aerosp Lab, 3M Ctr, St Paul, MN 55144 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Mat Sci & Chem Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Mangipudi, VS (reprint author), 3M Adhes Div, Aerosp Lab, 3M Ctr, 209-1C-22, St Paul, MN 55144 USA.",vsmangipudi@mmm.com,,,,,,91,19,19,1,23,AMER CHEMICAL SOC INC,AKRON,"RUBBER DIV UNIV AKRON PO BOX 499, AKRON, OH 44309-0499 USA",0035-9475,,,RUBBER CHEM TECHNOL,Rubber Chem.

The spreading of the cells, formation of F-actin and exposure of CD62P, a marker for alpha-granule release, were detected by specific antibodies and FITC-labelled phalloidine. The plasma proteins used were albumin, complement factors C1q and C3, fibrinogen, thrombin and von Willebrand factor. Normal plasma was used as a positive control. Of the pure plasma proteins adsorbed, von Willebrand factor was the only protein which induced a marked exposure (> 70%) of CD62P. Platelets adhering to fibrinogen and thrombin only showed a marked exposure (>70%) of CD62P when von Willebrand factor was added to the platelet suspension. This addition of von Willebrand factor inhibited the adhesion of platelets to surface-adsorbed C1q, C3 and albumin. The finding that pure von Willebrand factor was the only protein which induced a high exposure of CD62P was verified by the adhesion of platelets to surface-adsorbed factor-VIII deficient plasma. F-actin was seen around cell edges at all surfaces, although there was a difference in spreading.

This study was undertaken to determine the extent to which silicone elastomer, with or without either pre-adsorbed human serum albumin (HSA), IgG, fibrinogen or whole plasma, can activate peripheral blood monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats from the local Red Cross Blood Center. Monocytes were cultured for 18 h, culture supernatant collected, and analyzed for IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by employing commercial ELISA kits. Monocytes, in contact with either polystyrene or silicones without protein adsorption, were minimally activated as evidenced by the low concentration of all the cytokines measured. On the other hand, monocytes became activated when in contact with silicones having adsorbed either of the above proteins. The silicone gel, silicone oil and silicone gel/oil combination appeared to cause the monocytes to secrete nearly twice the amount of all three cytokines as compared with silicone elastomer. This result may be a function of the increased effective surface area produced by the silicone gels and silicone oils. Contact angle measurements confirm that silicones have a very hydrophobic surface, whereas tissue culture grade polystyrene (TPST) is hydrophilic. We know that hydrophobic surfaces tend to be much more denaturing to adsorbed proteins than hydrophilic surfaces. Thus our results indicate that plasma proteins adsorbed to very hydrophobic surfaces cause monocytes to secrete significant amounts of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

A human growth hormone (hGH) adsorption method was used in this study to investigate the influence of the formulated apatite (AP)-specific area on loading and release. AP powders were formulated with a 200-500 mu m granulometry and various specific areas. Two milligrams of hGH in solution were deposited for 24 h at 37 degrees C on 100 mg of AP with different specific areas. The amount of hGH loaded was determined by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and eluted stain bioassay (ESTA) using Nb2 lymphoma rat cells. Although loading was not greatly influenced by a specific area between 3 and 25 m(2)/g, dependency was noted for higher specific areas. Human GH release was measured by IRMA and ESTA over a 33-day period, with half-time release between 25 and 79 h. Comparison of IRMA and ESTA measurements for the hGH amounts loaded showed that hGH biologic activity was conserved. Results indicate that it is feasible to control the quantity of TA loading on AP by modifying specific areas for in vivo applications.

Surfaces were preconditioned with components of platelet-fibrin thrombi, including fibrinogen, thrombin, plasma, and isolated platelets. Experiments were performed in a radial flow chamber, and attachment rate constants were compared on the preconditioned surfaces in an effort to understand the complex relationship that exists between bacterial infection and thrombosis on synthetic biomaterials. Preadsorption of fibrinogen to surfaces significantly increased S. aureus adhesion compared to those preadsorbed with albumin alone while the presence of fibrin dramatically increased bacterial attachment compared to plasma preadsorbed surfaces. While the presence of adherent platelets also increased bacterial attachment, fibrin appeared to play a larger role in mediating bacterial adhesion on polyurethane surfaces. Striking results were obtained on the zwitterionic phosphonated polyurethane for a number ol: pretreatment conditions with regard to decreased bacterial adhesion and fibrinogen deposition.

In this study, human osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2) were cultured on two types of xenogenic biomaterials obtained from bovine bone. Both biomaterials were similar in architectural organization and surface topography, but they differed in matrix components. The first one was characterized by preservation of the mineralized collagen matrix, and the second by complete deproteinization which only preserved the mineral phase. Cells cultured at the surface of both biomaterials were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The beta(1)-integrin subunit, known to bind cell and collagen, is the major integrin of the osteoblast. It was localized using immunogold in transmission electron microscopy. At the surface of the collagen-containing matrix, cells exhibited an elongated shape and oriented axis parallel to the underlying collagen bundles. The beta(1)-integrin subunit was localized at the outer surface of cells, in close association with collagen and at the contact points between cells and biomaterials. In contrast, at the surface of the single mineral matrix, cells were round shaped with random disposition. Gold particles were found around the cells with no specific relation to the biomaterial. These results strongly suggest that the chemical nature of the surface of a bone biomaterial directly influences adhesion process, shape, and spatial organization of cultured osteoblastic cells.

In the past, integrin-binding peptides have been immobilized on substrates to partially control osteoblast adhesion; the present study focused on the design, synthesis, and bioactivity of the nos el peptide sequence Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg that selectively enhances heparan sulfate-mediated osteoblast adhesion mechanisms. Osteoblast, but not endothelial cell or fibroblast, adhesion was enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) on substrates modified with Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg peptides, indicating that these peptides may be osteoblast- or bone cell specific. Blocking osteoblast cell-membrane receptors with various concentrations of soluble Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptides did not inhibit subsequent cell adhesion on substrates modified with Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg peptides, providing evidence that osteoblasts interact with Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and with Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg peptides via distinct (i.e., integrin- and proteoglycan-mediated) mechanisms, each uniquely necessary for osteoblast adhesion. The present study constitutes an example of rational design/selection of bioactive peptides, confirms that osteoblast adhesion to substrates can be controlled selectively and significantly by immobilized peptides, and elucidates criteria and strategies for the design of proactive dental/orthopedic implant biomaterials.

The primate also is used in orthopedic-related research for studying limb anatomy, gait, and age-related bone loss. In order to better understand the appropriateness of these animal models for human THR, external morphologies of thirty-three adult Caucasian human, sixteen adult chimpanzee, and forty-two adult greyhound femora were compared using osteometric methods. Measured parameters included anteversion angle, cervico-diaphyseal angle, femoral head offset in the frontal plane, and anterior bo cv profiles along the femoral diaphysis. Although some of the measured parameters were approximately similar between species (e.g., mean cervico-diaphyseal angle of humans and chimpanzees), the majority demonstrated morphologic differences that may be biomechanically significant for interpreting stress transfer across the hip (e.g., mean anteversion angle and mean normalized femoral head offset between species). Additionally, age-related changes in proximal femoral morphology and gait pattern, as well as species-related differences in local muscle and inertial forces, may result in notably different loading conditions across the hip joint of each species. Therefore, discretion must be exercised when evaluating canine or primate THR materials and designs for potential use in the human hip.

Conditions maximizing surface coverage for each molecule were employed with the aim of inhibiting protein adsorption and increasing the density of end groups. Neutron reflectivities of the grafted layers immersed in deuterium oxide (heavy water) were measured and used to calculate volume fraction profiles of the polymer as a function of distance from the surface. These density profiles were combined with protein adsorption data on the grafted layers to compare with recent theoretical and experimental studies of protein resistance by PEO at surfaces. We found that the grafting density is maximized by coupling the linear PEO from a K2SO4 salt buffer, which is a poor solvent for PEO. However, the grafting density of star PEO was maximized when no K2SO4 was used and the stars were dissolved near the overlap concentration. Concentration profiles obtained from the reflectivity data show that the hydrated polymers swell to similar to 10 times the dried layer thickness and exhibit a low density (maximum volume fractions < 0.4 PEO) throughout the layer. The PEO surfaces obtained with both the star and linear polymers resisted adsorption of cytochrome-c and albumin except for a small amount of cytochrome-c adsorption on the short, many-armed star polymer surface. A hypothesis of adsorption on the star polymer layer is presented and criteria for controlling receptor-mediated cell-substrate interactions by ligand-modified chain ends are discussed.

The oxygen complex differentiates between the enantiomeric isomers of amino acids and sugars. The direction of this differentiation agrees with that of biological systems in nature where only the L-isomers of amino acids are used to form proteins, while D-form sugars form polysaccharides. These results represent the first complete differentiation of enantiomeric isomers in an inorganic system, and were achieved without the aid of any in vivo biomaterials, such as enzymes. Other alkali chlorides were also examined. The eutectic compound of potassium chloride and water forms a similar oxygen complex which also differentiates the isomers of amino acids and sugars. However, the direction of this differentiation is opposite that in the case of sodium chloride. These results call for the special attention to the fact that the concentration of potassium ions in living cells is higher than that of sodium ions. The mechanism of these observations is not yet clear, but is likely to involve the structure of an aqueous solution of a specific concentration (0.1 M) of salt. The effects of various gases were also examined. Like oxygen, hydrogen sulfide also forms a complex with the eutectic compound of sodium chloride and water. This complex differentiates the isomers of amino acids and sugars in a similar manner to the way the oxygen complex dose. This finding suggests that the enantiomeric isomers of amino acids and sugars could be differentiated in an inorganic environment. Carbon dioxide also forms a complex with the eutectic compound of sodium chloride and water, but does not differentiate the isomers.","Kanagawa Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 2591293, Japan","Fujiwara, S (reprint author), Kanagawa Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, 2946 Tsuchiya, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 2591293, Japan.",,,,,,,21,7,7,1,3,JAPAN SOC ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,TOKYO,"26-2 NISHIGOTANDA 1 CHOME SHINAGAWA-KU, TOKYO, 141, JAPAN",0910-6340,,,ANAL SCI,Anal.

Whereas receptor interactions with freely diffusible soluble ligands are quantitatively governed by the mean ligand concentration, interactions with spatially constrained substratum-bound ligands may be affected not only by the mean ligand concentration, but also by the ligand spatial microdistribution. To probe this hypothesis we have generated surfaces presenting galactose ligands at different concentrations and different capabilities for micromobility - and thus spatial microdistribution - by means of polyethylene oxide tethering and assayed for hepatocyte spreading mediated by asialoglycoprotein receptor/cytoskeleton linkages. We demonstrate that spreading is not uniquely determined by the mean galactose concentration presented by the culture substrate. Rather, the ability of primary hepatocytes to spread is additionally specified by a combination of ligand concentration and tether length. Our results suggest spreading results when monovalent ligands possess sufficient mobility to form effectively multivalent bonds with the receptor; that is, when the substratum-bound ligands to cluster in spatial microdomains.

The implant consists of a silicone tube that is inserted into the anterior chamber at one end and is attached at the other end to a silicone plate that is sutured to the outside of the globe beneath the conjunctiva. The glaucoma ""implant"" becomes a ""drain"" over the first 3 to 6 postoperative weeks as the silicone plate is enclosed by a fibrous capsule that allows a space to form into which fluid can drain and from which fluid can be absorbed by the surrounding tissues. Ideally, the size and thickness of the capsule (the filtering bleb) that surrounds the plate is such that the amount of fluid that passes through the capsule is identical to the amount of fluid produced by the eye at an intraocular pressure of 8 to 14 mmHg. The most common long-term complication of these implants is failure of the filtering bleb 2 to 4 years after surgery due to the formation of a thick fibrous capsule around the device. Micromovement of the smooth drainage plate against the scleral surface may be integral to the mechanism of glaucoma implant failure by stimulating low-level activation of the wound healing response, increased collagen scar formation, and increased fibrous capsule thickness. To test this hypothesis, we modified seven Baerveldt implants by adding porous cellular ingrowth material to the posterior surface of the drainage plate. Seven modified and five unmodified implants were placed in adult rabbit eyes. After 6 months,we found that the fibrous capsule around the modified implants was significantly thinner than the capsule surrounding the unmodified implants (p < 0.05), particularly on the surface between the porous ingrowth material and the sclera (p < 0.05). Although type I collagen predominated in the fibrous capsules around both types of implants, the amount of type III collagen in the capsules around the modified implants was significantly less than the amount around the unmodified implants (p < 0.05). We believe that these data suggest a reduction in the wound healing response to the modified implants, with greater stability of capsule thickness. Long-term studies are needed to verify that the stability of the capsules around the modified implants persists over a period of years, in which case this type of modification may prove useful in prolonging the functional life of these devices in the surgical treatment of glaucoma.

With few exceptions, cement degradation caused by specimen processing has not been systematically and quantitatively assessed. This is especially the case for the new non-formalin based fixatives currently being marketed. We measured physical and mechanical changes that accumulated over time as bone cement was exposed to different chemicals routinely used for fixation, dehydration, and embedding hard tissue specimens. Cylindrical bone cement plugs were submersed into 14 different chemical solutions according to applicable histological protocols. After exposure to the chemicals, the weight, volume, and compressive strength of each specimen was measured. The type of chemicals used for fixation, dehydration, and infiltration, and the length of time in solution were significant factors in the physical and mechanical differences observed.

Design: Randomized laboratory investigation using a synthetic subtrochanteric femur fracture model. Setting: Simulated stable and unstable fractures were created at three levels in the subtrochanteric region of synthetic femora. Instrumented specimens were tested elastically in a biomaterials testing system. Intervention: Synthetic femora were instrumented with either a statically locked first-generation femoral nail or a statically locked second-generation femoral nail. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness for both the stable and unstable fracture groups was measured in both compression and torsion. Unstable fracture specimens were tested to failure in compression, and load to failure was measured. Results: Throughout the subtrochanteric region, second-generation femoral nail constructs were consistently stiffer in compression and torsion than were statically locked first-generation femoral nail constructs. In general, second-generation constructs also withstood larger loads to failure in the unstable fracture model. Conclusions: Second-generation nails provided significantly enhanced mechanical stiffness compared with first-generation femoral nails when used to treat both stable and unstable subtrochanteric femur fractures. Although these results were obtained by using a well-controlled, mechanically consistent model, clinical validation of an increased incidence of fracture unions or of decreased time to union is required before we can recommend that second-generation nails be used routinely to treat subtrochanteric femur fractures.","Univ Kentucky, Albert B Chandler Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed Surg, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Pugh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Albert B Chandler Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed Surg, K-411 Kentucky Clin, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",,,,,,,31,24,24,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0890-5339,1531-2291,,J ORTHOP TRAUMA,J.

Non-implanted specimens and those implanted with carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide, hafnium, or noble metals were passive over a wide range of potentials. Implantation of carbon, nitrogen, or yttrium led to breakdown of the oxide film and pitting corrosion. The breakdown potentials decreased with increasing dose.

Design: The study design was a histopathologic study on a cohort of capsule fractions and complete eyes. Participants: Fifty-nine patients participated in this study, in which 60 specimens, including 37 hydrogel and 21 silicone capsule specimens as well as 2 whole eyes, were gathered. There were no control subjects. Intervention: The capsule specimens were obtained from eyes operated on previously for scleral buckling for retinal detachment. The two whole eyes were enucleated. All specimens were studied with routine optic microscopy. Main Outcome Measures: Patient characteristics, type of scleral buckling, and number of operations performed were analyzed. Histologically, the capsular structure, its interface with the explant, and its different components also were studied. Remnants of the buckling material also were investigated. Results: There were 45 male and 14 female patients, with a mean age of 49 years. Histologically, capsule specimens had a fibrous matrix with fibroblasts and few inflammatory cells. Eighteen (48.6%) of 37 hydrogel capsule specimens displayed hydrogel fragments surrounded by a foreign body giant cell granuloma in 16 cases. Conclusion: Nonabsorbable materials undergo encapsulation after implantation on the eye surface. Giant cell granuloma was observed in some hydrogel capsule specimens in relation to hydrogel fragmentation. The exact origin of this fragmentation remains unknown.","Hotel Dieu, Dept Ophthalmol, F-75181 Paris 04, France; Hop Bichat, Dept Ophthalmol, F-75877 Paris, France","D'Hermies, F (reprint author), Hotel Dieu, Dept Ophthalmol, 1 Pl Parvis Notre Dame, F-75181 Paris 04, France.",,,,,,,20,31,31,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0161-6420,,,OPHTHALMOLOGY,Ophthalmology,JUN,1998.0,105,6,,,,,1079,1086,,10.1016/S0161-6420(98)96011-0,,,,8,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,ZR726,WOS:000074007600041,9627660.0,,,,2019-02-25

Five patients experienced a knee joint infection after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with 4 artificial graftings, and 9 caught joint or wound infections, after limb traumatic injuries or bone neoplastic ruptures involving femur, tibia, calcaneum and humerus, treated by arthroplasty or osteosynthesis with implantation of biomaterials. Septic arthritis was experienced one week to one year after reconstructive surgery, and had evolved for several months to years before etiologic diagnosis in 5 cases. Specimens of pus, tissues or removed implants produced numerous slow growing small colonies of Gram positive cocci arranged in clumps on culture media incubated in anaerobic atmosphere only. In 10 patients, the same organism was disclosed in several separate specimens. The identification of P. magnus was assessed by the enzym profile (rapid ID 32A API strips), gaz liquid chromatography, catalase and coagulase production, resistance to novobiocin and Na polyanethol sulphonate, antibiotic sensitivity testing performed by disc method was constant to penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, imipenem and pristinamycin with penicillin G MICs < 0,125 mg/l and metronidazole MICs < 1mg/l. Erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampicin, tetracycline and fosfomycin were active against more than 70 % of P. magnus.. All patients were cured after a prolonged course of various antibiotics and surgical removal of the foreign material whenever possible. We studied in vitro binding of P. magnus with extracellular matrix proteins adsorbed onto biomaterials, by particle agglutination assays of latex beads coated with proteins. Eigty one % of strains bound to collagen, 69 % to fibrinogen and 46 % to fibonectin.

Seven cadaveric cervical spines were implanted with a porous tantalum spacer and a titanium alloy spacer, and their radiographic and imaging characteristics were evaluated. Objective. To determine the radiographic characteristics of porous tantalum and titanium implants used as spacers in the cervical spine. Summary of Background Data. Anterior decompressive surgery of the disc space or the vertebral body creates a defect that frequently is repaired with autologous bone grafts to promote spinal fusion. Donor site morbidity, insufficient donor material, and additional surgical time have spurred the development of biomaterials to replace or supplement existing spinal reconstruction techniques. Although the promotion of a solid bony fusion is critical, the implanted biomaterial should be compatible with modern imaging techniques, should allow visualization of the spinal canal and neural foramina, and should permit radiographic assessment of bony ingrowth. Methods. Cadaveric spines containing the implants were imaged with plain radiography, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The image distortion produced by the implants was determined qualitatively and quantitatively. Results. The tantalum and titanium spacers were opaque on plain radiographic films. On computed tomographic scans, more streak artifact was associated with the tantalum implants than with the titanium. On magnetic resonance imaging, the porous tantalum implant demonstrated less artifact than did the titanium spacer on T1- and T2-weighted spin echo and on T2*-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance images. Overall; the tantalum im pla nt produced less artifact on magnetic resonance imaging than did the titanium spacer and therefore allowed for better visualization of the surrounding bony and neural structures. Conclusion. The material properties of titanium and porous tantalum cervical interbody implants contribute to their differential appearance in different imaging methods. The titanium implant appears to image best with computed tomography, whereas the porous tantalum implant produces less artifact than does the titanium implant on several magnetic resonance imaging sequences.","Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurol Surg, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; Univ Miami, Dept Neurosurg, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; Wallace Mem Baptist Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Pusan, South Korea; Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neuroradiol, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA","Dickman, CA (reprint author), Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurol Surg, 350 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.",,,,,,,16,29,29,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,JUN 1,1998.0,23,11,,,,,1245,1250,,10.1097/00007632-199806010-00014,,,,6,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,ZU113,WOS:000074163600014,9636978.0,,,,2019-02-25

We used these sheets to replace part of the pericardium in dogs, and the state of pericardial repair and regeneration were evaluated. As a control sheet, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (EPTFE) with a thickness of 0.1 mm was used. After implantation of the PGA-amnion (DHT-H) sheet, soft connective tissue with abundant capillaries was observed, and its surface was covered with a mesothelial cell layer with many microvilli. The basement membrane was nearly normal. After implantation of the PGA-amnion (GA-S) sheet, dense connective tissue was observed, and its surface was covered with mesothelial cells. However, there were only a few microvilli, and the basement membrane was incomplete. After implantation of the EPTFE sheet, only a multilayer structure of dense connective tissue was observed. The connective tissue was exposed without mesothelial cells on its surface. Thus, pericardial repair and regeneration were induced by implantation of a sheet produced by dehydrothermal cross-linking, which does not impair the chemical properties of collagen purified from human amnion.","Kyoto Univ, Dept Artificial Organs, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 606, Japan",,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,2,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-4947,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,SUM,1998.0,4,2,,,,,131,141,,10.1089/ten.1998.4.131,,,,11,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,ZY304,WOS:000074606700002,,,,,2019-02-25

Well correlated second-order models are fitted to determine the extraction yields of arsenobetaine (AsBet), a probable arsenosugar (AsS), monomethylarsonate (MMA), dimethylarsinate (DMA) and As (V). By using focused microwaves the time of sample preparation is much shorter than in other methods. At powers close to 40 W with exposure times less than 4 min in methanol/water (55/45), the whole extraction yield reaches 85%.

The thermal parameters were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). While heating rates and sample size had strong effects on thermal properties, the influences of cooling rates were minor. For DSC, broad melting transitions were obtained at faster heating and/or slower cooling rates and larger sample sizes. Higher melting temperatures were obtained when heating rates and sample size were increased. Slower cooling rates also produced higher melting and crystallization temperatures. Faster cooling rates yielded lower heats of fusion during melting and also lower heats of crystallization. The dependence of peak melting and crystallization temperatures on the heating and cooling rates are illustrated by two empirical formulas. For TGA, it is found that faster heating rates and larger sample sizes produced higher decomposition temperatures. This detailed analysis may explain the large variations in the reported data on thermal properties and crystallinity of UHMWPE and provide solutions to the current clinical problems associated with polymeric biomaterials.

Although the metal sequestering capabilities of biomaterials have been known, a general inability to accurately predict their binding characteristics has been a barrier to their implementation in remediation schemes. Of interest in our laboratory are the binding mechanisms as well as basic chemistry involved in the metal uptake of the material derived from fragments of cell walls from cultured cells from the plant D. innoxia. Previous studies have suggested the dependency of lead-ion affinity distributions of the biomaterial upon solution variables (i.e., ionic strength, pH) to be the result of two classes of binding sites: low-affinity sites involving sulfonates and carboxylates in an ion-exchange process and high-affinity sites resulting from the coordination of carboxylates to the metal. This hypothesis has been further investigated by the removal of the dominant functionality on the biomaterial (carboxylates) by carboxyl esterification by mildly acidic methanol. The resulting modified biomaterial was then studied in terms of affinity distributions toward proton and lead ions. The content of sulfonates on the biomaterial was found to be 43 mu mol/g. A total amount of carboxylates involved in Pb2+ binding was found to be 560 mu mol/g with 147 mu mol/g involved in an ion-exchange mechanism and coordination sites including 212 mu mol/g biomaterial.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biochem & Chem, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Rayson, GD (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biochem & Chem, Box 30001 MSC 3C, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",,,,,,,39,46,52,1,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

The results of different procedures (perpendicular and parallel to the cartilage surface) in young and young-adult animals were analyzed: septal incision at different locations (young-old), cricoid split (young-old), suturing cartilage, closing defects with autologous cartilage (young), biomaterials (young) and newly engineered cartilage in 4- and 24-week-old rabbits (series of ten animals). Cartilage of the young rabbit and child have similar hyaline cartilage with a varying distribution in thickness. Thinner areas are more susceptible to malformations. Incisions through younger cartilage give rise to some new cartilage formation covered by a new layer of perichondrium; through older, differentiated cartilage the incision causes superficial but permanent necrosis. Edges of cut cartilage mostly do heal by formation of fibrous junctions. This forms a weak spot, sensitive to deviations. The same fate goes for the healing between the autologous graft and the surrounding pre-existent cartilage. Trauma parallel to the surface, leads to inconsistent quantity of neocartilage. With ageing the wound healing and regenerative capacities decrease. In general, biomaterials are less accepted by the surrounding tissues and would impede further growth. Only newly engineered, and thus less differentiated (younger) cartilage of hyaline nature, appeared to be well accepted at the interface with the edges of a cartilage defect. There are indications that the release of growth factors might play a role in cartilage wound healing. In the child as well as the adult, wound healing of hyaline cartilage structures is incomplete, and surgery remains 'experimental' surgery. The clinical implications of gradual loss of the regenerative capacity of hyaline cartilage should be further investigated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It is now accepted that nitrates can interact with many plastics and other biomaterials, but no work has been published on dialysis membranes. Accordingly, we studied the influence of dialysis, and in particular the influence of the nature of the membrane on the plasma concentration and the elimination of ISDN and its two active metabolites, isosorbide 2- and 5-mononitrates (2- and 5-ISMN). We simulated dialysis in vitro, to study the influence of seven different membranes on the levels of these nitrates. The concentrations of the three nitrates were measured upstream and downstream of the membrane (A and B, respectively), and in the ultrafiltrate (C), at times 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60'. Significant differences in concentration were found for ISDN in the three sample solutions A, B and C against time with the polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile, cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate. These differences are apparently due to an interaction of ISDN with these membranes. In addition, significant differences in ISDN concentrations were observed between the polysulfone membrane and the polyacrylonitrile, hemophan and cuprophan membranes. However, these differences diminished with time and were no longer significant after I h. There was no significant difference in 2- and 5-ISMN concentrations in time between any of the sample solutions that could be attributed to metabolite-membrane interactions, or between different membranes.

The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate the role of the local bacteriologic flora in its occurrence. Methods and Results-Specimens were collected at the site of implantation for culture from the skin and the pocket before and after insertion in a consecutive series of patients who underwent elective permanent pacemaker implantation. Microorganisms isolated both at the time of insertion and of any potentially infective complication were compared by using conventional speciation and ribotyping. There were 103 patients (67 men and 36 women) whose age ranged from 16 to 93 years (mean+/-SD, 67+/-15). At the time of pacemaker implantation, a total of 267 isolates were identified. The majority (85%) were staphylococci. During a mean follow-up of 16.5 months (range, 1 to 24), infection occurred in four patients (3.9%). In two of them, an isolate of Staphylococcus schleiferi was recognized by molecular method as identical to the one previously found in the pacemaker pocket. In one patient, Staphylococcus aureus, an organism that was absent at the time of pacemaker insertion, was isolated. In another patient, a Staphylococcus epidermidis was identified both at the time of pacemaker insertion and when erosion occurred; however, their antibiotic resistance profiles were different. Conclusions-This study strongly supports the hypothesis that pacemaker-related infections are mainly due to local contamination during implantation. S schleiferi appears to play an underestimated role in infectious colonization of implanted biomaterials and should be regarded as an important opportunistic pathogen.","Hop Cardiovasc & Pneumol Louis Pradel, Serv Cardiol, F-69394 Lyon 03, France; Hop Cardiovasc & Pneumol Louis Pradel, Bacteriol Lab, F-69394 Lyon 03, France","Touboul, P (reprint author), Hop Cardiovasc & Pneumol Louis Pradel, Serv Cardiol, BP Lyon Montchat, F-69394 Lyon 03, France.",,"ETIENNE, Jerome/C-5471-2014; Vandenesch, Francois/C-7209-2014","ETIENNE, Jerome/0000-0002-3348-3315; Vandenesch, Francois/0000-0001-9412-7106",,,,19,101,105,1,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-7322,1524-4539,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,MAY 12,1998.0,97,18,,,,,1791,1795,,10.1161/01.CIR.97.18.1791,,,,5,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,ZM245,WOS:000073519200008,9603533.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Polymers were compression-molded into circular discs of 14 mm x 1 mm in diameter. On post-operative days 7, 14, 28 and 60, histological tissue samples were removed, prepared by fixation and staining, and analyzed by light microscopy. PLAGA matrices produced mild inflammatory reactions and were completely degraded at the end of 60 days, leaving implant tissues that were similar to surgical wounds without implants. TMA-gly:CPH (10:90 and 30:70) matrices produced mild inflammatory reactions by the end of 60 days, similar to those seen with PLAGA. TMA-gly:CPH (50:50) produced moderate inflammatory reactions characterized by macrophages and edema. PMA-ala:CPH matrices elicited minimal inflammatory reactions that were characterized by fibrous encapsulation by the end of 60 days. In vivo degradation rates of poly(anhydride-co-imides) were similar to PLAGA. Both PMA:ala:CPH and TMA-gly:CPH matrices maintained their shapes and degraded at a constant rate over the period of two months. These polymers, possessing good mechanical properties and tissue compatibility, may be useful in weight-bearing applications in bone. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Long-term failure mechanisms for polyethylene in total hip arthoplasty (THA) differ from those seen in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) although the same materials are used.

Low (20-40%) and high (70-90%) crystallinity hydroxyapatite (rHA and cHA), rough titanium (Ti), and tissue culture polystyrene (TP) surfaces were compared. Surface chemistry and calcium resorption of HA coatings, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and growth of cells were measured for Matrigel(R)-coated and uncoated surfaces at 2, 7, and 14 days. Gene expression for four noncollagenous bone-related proteins (osteonectin, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin) was also investigated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction up to 28 days. Ca concentration in incubating solutions increased with time for the two types of HA coatings and was always greater for rHA than cHA. Surface chemistry and coating dissolution rates were not affected by the presence of Matrigel(R) or cells throughout the study. APA of cells on the two HA-coated surfaces was comparably enhanced in the presence of Matrigel(R) and was greater than on Ti surfaces. Only HA surfaces showed an increased APA of cells with time in the presence of Matrigel(R). Cell growth peaked at 7 days and was greatest for cells on the two HA surfaces and without Matrigel(R). At 14 days, cell growth was comparable on the four surfaces. The presence of HA and Matrigel(R) enhanced cell-specific APA at 14 days. Gene expression for all four proteins investigated showed no differences between surfaces after 7 days. At 2 and 7 days,gene expression was indicative of proliferation for Ti, and of proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization for HA and TP more so without Matrigel(R). The addition of this matrix significantly enhanced mitogenicity of calvarial cells on HA only after 14 days. Matrigel(R) eliminated differences seen between the two HA coatings. Gene expression was not enhanced or inhibited by the presence of Matrigel(R).

Currently, tissue engineering offers the possibility of performing a suitable therapeutic wound coverage after early burn excision by using cultured keratinocyte sheets supported by a dermal layer. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a skin substitute composed of both epidermal and dermal elements. For this purpose we grew keratinocytes and fibroblasts separately for 15 days within two different types of biomaterials. Cells then were co-cultured for an additional period of 15 days, after which samples were taken and processed with either classic or immunohistochemical stainings. Results showed that (1) human fibroblasts and keratinocytes can be cultured on hyaluronic acid-derived biomaterials and that (2) the pattern of expression of particular dermal-epidermal molecules is similar to that found in normal skin. The data from this study suggest that our skin equivalent might be useful in the treatment of both bums and chronic wounds.

Human bone marrow cells have been chosen because these cells are in direct contact with the biomaterial after implantation in situ. The sensitivity of this method is evaluated for materials which are already being used as implants in humans and animal, e.g., hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic, pure titanium, and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). As indicative parameters of biocompatibility primary cell adherence, cell number, cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix, cell vitality, and cell differentiation are described. After 2 weeks in culture, obvious differences between the biomaterials with respect to the indicative parameters could be observed. Cell numbers were greatest on the HA specimens. Ln the case of titanium alloys, we observed a decreased number of cells. The production of extracellular matrix was high for the HA ceramics but reduced for titanium specimens. The polymers allowed only a few adherent cells and showed no signs of extracellular matrix production. The results can be correlated astonishingly well to animal experiments and clinical experiences. Therefore, we suggest that this cell culture system seems to be a useful tool for biocompatibility testing of bone implantation materials. It also helps reduce animal experiments. With the help of flow cytophotometry, we analyzed the influence of biomaterials on large numbers of cells with respect to differentiation. There were similar populations of T cells and monocytes on all specimens tested. Extended B-cell and granulocyte populations, however, were observed with titanium and UHMWPE. Most osteocalcin-containing cells adhered to the HA ceramics.

In order to improve the integration of implants, it is desirable to control interfacial reactions such that nonspecific adsorption of proteins is minimized and tissue-healing phenomena can be controlled. In this regard, our goal has been do develop a method to functionalize oxidized titanium surfaces by the covalent immobilization of bioactive organic molecules. Titanium first was chemically treated with a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate surface contaminants and to produce a consistent and reproducible titanium oxide surface layer. An intermediary aminoalkylsilane spacer molecule was then covalently Linked to the oxide layer, followed by the covalent binding of either alkaline phosphatase or albumin to the free terminal NH2 groups using glutaraldehyde as a coupling agent. Surface analyses following coating procedures consisted of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Enzymatic activity of coupled alkaline phosphatase was assayed colorimetrically, and surface coverage by bound albumin was evaluated by SEM visualization of colloidal gold immunolabeling. Our results indicate that the linkage of the aminoalkylsilane to the oxidized surface is stable and that bound proteins such alkaline phosphatase and albumin retain their enzymatic activity and antigenicity, respectively. The density of immunolabeling for albumin suggests that the binding and surface coverage obtained is in excess of what would be expected for inducing biological activity. In conclusion, this method offers the possibility of covalently Linking selected molecules with known biological activity to oxidized titanium surfaces in order to guide and promote the tissue healing that occurs during implant integration in bone and soft tissues.

In this context, calcium-phosphate ceramics present similar degradation processes in vivo and in vitro to those found in a natural calcified substrate. As the monocyte/macrophage lineage is among the first cells to appear in ceramic implantation sites, it is a key protagonist in inflammatory reaction and biodegradation mechanisms. This study investigated the ability of human monocytes/macrophages activated by various agents [Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), polymyxin B (PMB)] to degrade biphasic calcium-phosphate ceramics. PMB sulfate is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that modulates LPS-induced cell activities in vivo and in vitro. Degradation pits (about 10 mu m) produced on the pellet surface by these monocytes were discrete, with well defined margins. LPS increased the degradation of calcium-phosphate ceramic (number of lacunae, mean pellet surface area degraded) in a dose-dependent manner whereas polymyxin B downmodulated it significantly. The addition of 2 mu g/mL of polymyxin B reduced the number of degradation lacunae and the extent of degraded surface area induced by 0.1 mu g/mL, LPS by 87% and 64%, respectively. Thus this cell culture system can be very useful in the study of cellular degradation of biomaterials and of the influence of therapeutic agents that may modulate these cell activities.

They seem to be involved in osteoclast activation and bone resorption and probably play a role in osseointegrated implant rejection. In this study we investigate the ability of titanium implants to cause an imbalance in the homeostatic equilibrium of cytokines using the peritoneal cavity of DB-A2 mice as a model. The inflammatory response was evaluated as a messenger ribonucleic acid expression determined by the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique in peritoneal macrophages from titanium-implanted mice. Interleukin-6 release was detected by a specific quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results have shown that titanium implants do not significantly stimulate the proinflammatory cytokine system compared to the control group. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test confirms, after a peak in secretion at day 1 compared with basal levels, a clear decrease in interleukin-6 at basal levels on following control at 6 and 9 days after implantation. The study of the interaction between implanted biomaterials and inflammatory mediators seems to be very promising. Perhaps a better understanding of the mechanisms of bone resorption could lead to finding a new clinical solution for patients with osseointegrated implant rejection.","Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Surg, Plast & Reconstruct Surg Sect, Rome, Italy; CNR, Inst Tissue Typing & Dialysis, Rome, Italy","Giudiceandrea, F (reprint author), Via Paola Falconieri 110, I-00152 Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,28,8,8,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

Cross-linking agents have been applied routinely to reduce host-tissue response, including antigenicity, and to improve tissue leaflet durability. Evaluation of improvements in bovine pericardial valve leaflet calcification and flexibility require that in vitro systems be developed to correlate data with results from in vivo studies. This study describes an in vitro test system used to evaluate the effects of two surface-modifying treatments on pericardial tissue hemocompatibility. Methods: Non-fixed and glutaraldehyde fixation-processed (GA) bovine pericardial tissues were exposed to anticoagulated whole blood for 60 min. Blood was then removed, and platelet-poor plasma prepared and frozen at -70 degrees C until analyzed for kallikrein activation and release of platelet factor 4 (PF4). Blood-exposed tissue samples were analyzed for fibrin(ogen) binding with an anti-fibrinogen antibody and for tissue cellular responsiveness (blood cell adherence and aggregation) by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Conditions were determined for minimum extent of pumping action by the minicam system required to allow for solution movement while not tearing or wearing the tissue. A blood-tissue exposure time of 60 min provided sufficient first-pass exposure to evaluate the acute blood-tissue response. The relative degree of both kallikrein activation and PF4 release was greater in the non-fixed tissue but a greater number of fibrin(ogen) molecules per cm(2) was found on GA-treated tissue. Scanning electron microscopy showed a differential cell response of non-fixed tissue compared with GA-treated tissue. Conclusion: This non-static test system demonstrated great promise for use in routine in vitro hemocompatibility testing of blood-contacting biological biomaterials.","Baxter Int, CRTS, Round Lake, IL 60073 USA; Baxter Healthcare Corp, Edwards CVS Div, Irvine, CA USA","Amrani, DL (reprint author), Baxter Int, CRTS, RLT-12,Route 120 & Wilson Rd, Round Lake, IL 60073 USA.",,,,,,,15,1,2,0,1,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD, ENGLAND HA6 2ET",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

A variety of anticalcification treatments has been proposed but none has proved to prevent calcific degeneration. The study aim was to evaluate, in vitro, the time course of calcium uptake of porcine and bovine biomaterials and the efficacy of anticalcification treatments. Methods: Samples of glutaraldehyde-tanned biomaterials with (Carpentier-Edwards, Medtronic Intact, Hancock II, MZGTB) or without anticalcification treatment (Mitroflow) were incubated with culture medium containing physiological calcium levels. Specimens were then analyzed at two, four or eight weeks for their calcium content (mg/g wet weight). Results: All specimens calcified over time, though the time courses for each were significantly different. Mitroflow and Intact valves accumulated high calcium levels rapidly during the first two weeks, with small further increases thereafter. Anticalcification treatment reduced calcium uptake of Carpentier-Edwards material during the first two weeks of incubation, but the material gradually attained comparable calcium levels at eight weeks. Hancock valves and the self-customized MZGTB valve showed the lowest calcium levels over the test period. Conclusions: This in vitro study documented major differences in calcium uptake of different biomaterials. Some anticalcification treatments render the material temporarily less susceptible to calcium binding but none can prevent calcification. In vitro testing has proved to be a valuable instrument for evaluating anticalcification treatments, but should be combined with evaluation of bioprosthesis surface interaction with circulating blood.","Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Cardiothorac & Vasc Surg, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Med Stat, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Biochem, D-55131 Mainz, Germany","Dahm, M (reprint author), Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Cardiothorac & Vasc Surg, Langenbeckstr 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.",,,,,,,25,3,3,0,1,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD, ENGLAND HA6 2ET",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

From the original description of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH), new techniques such as continuous venous venous hemofiltration (CAVH), hemodiafiltration (HDF) and high flux dialysis (HFD) have been developed and clinically utilized. A parallel improvement in efficiency has been achieved with daily clearances of urea as high as 50 liters or more. The use of special highly permeable dialyzers has also permitted increases in the clearances of large solutes, thus leading to significant removals of chemical substances involved the acute inflammation and sepsis. In this field, recent observations have suggested the use of hemofiltration with high volumes of fluid exchange. The hardware and software of the newer continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) systems are certainly the key points in achieving these results and in safely performing such challenging techniques.","St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy; Austin & Repatriat Med Ctr, Intens Care Unit, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia","Ronco, C (reprint author), St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,25,42,45,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0085-2538,,,KIDNEY INT,Kidney Int.,MAY,1998.0,53,,,66,,,S160,S164,,,,,,5,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,ZK108,WOS:000073285700032,9573595.0,,,,2019-02-25

For instance, phonation threshold pressure, a measure of the ""ease"" of phonation, has been shown to be directly related to the viscosity of the vibrating mucosa. Various implantable biomaterials have been used in vocal fold augmentation surgery, with implantation sites sometimes close to or inside the mucosa. Yet their viscosities or other mechanical properties are seldom known. This study attempts to provide data on viscosities of commonly used phonosurgical biomaterials. Using a parallel-plate rotational rheometer, oscillatory shear experiments were performed on implantable polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon or Polytef; Mentor Inc., Hingham, MA), collagen (Zyderm; Collagen Corp., Pale Alto, CA), glutaraldehyde crosslinked (GAX) collagen (Phonagel or Zyplast; Collagen Corp.), absorbable gelatin (Gelfoam; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI), and human abdominal subcutaneous fat. Samples of human vocal fold mucosal tissues were also tested, Under sinusoidal oscillatory shear at 10 Hz and at 37 degrees C, the dynamic viscosity was 116 Pascal-seconds (Pa-s) for polytetrafluoroethylene, 21 Pa-s for gelatin, 8-13 Pa-s for the two types of collagen, 3 Pa-s for fat, and 1 to 3 Pa-s for vocal fold mucosa. Results extrapolated to 100 Hz also show similar differences among the biomaterials, but all values are an order of magnitude lower because of the typical inverse frequency relation (shear thinning effect) for polymeric and biologic materials. The data suggest that the use of fat for vocal fold augmentation may be more conducive to the ""ease"" of phonation because of its relatively low viscosity, which is closest to physiologic levels. This implication is probably the most relevant in predicting initial outcome of the postoperative voice before there is any significant assimilation (e.g., resorption and fibrosis) of the implanted biomaterial.","Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Chan, RW (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, 330 WJSHC, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [P60 DC00976],,,38,110,114,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-852X,1531-4995,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,MAY,1998.0,108,5,,,,,725,731,,10.1097/00005537-199805000-00019,,,,7,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,ZM323,WOS:000073527000019,9591554.0,,,,2019-02-25

The cyclic conformation of the RGD motif grafted on the protein mimics the conformation of the motif displayed in native adhesion proteins such as fibronectin. The adhesion of the cells on polystyrene coated with the conjugate BSA-peptide was similar or even better than the one obtained when the proadhesive protein fibronectin was coated on the plates. Results also indicated that covalent coupling of the peptide on BSA is not absolutely required, since simple adsorption of the peptide on the protein coated on plates was efficient for enhancing cell adhesion. These results show that polystyrene support can be reconditioned with conformationally constrained RGD peptides to enhance cell adhesion on solid supports. The same methodology can be adapted for the development of new biomaterials based on the recognition of specific peptides.","Fac Univ Notre Dame Paix, Lab Cellular Biochem, B-5000 Namur, Belgium",,,,,,,,19,18,20,0,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0929-5666,,,LETT PEPT SCI,Lett.

To evaluate this approach, we prepared novel polyurethane matrices loaded with hirudin and coated them with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) by glow discharge plasma deposition (GDPD) to reduce the release rate. Methods. Polyurethane (BioSpan(R)) matrices containing hirudin and pore former (d-mannitol or BSA) were prepared by the solvent casting method. HEMA plasma deposition was then applied using GDPD technique to create a diffusional barrier film on the surface of the matrices. The effect of pore former and HEMA plasma coating on the release of hirudin was systematically investigated. Surface properties of matrices was also studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA). Results, The release of hirudin from BioSpan(R) matrix could be controlled by changing the weight fraction and particle size of pore former HEMA plasma treatment of matrices produced a thin, highly crosslinked film on the surface. The initial burst and subsequent release of hirudin was significantly reduced after HEMA plasma coating, which suggested that the plasma disposition acted as a diffusional barrier and limited the release of hirudin incorporated in the polyurethane matrix. Conclusions, The plasma coating served as a diffusional barrier, and could work to control the release kinetics of hirudin by changing the various plasma coating conditions. Local delivery of hirudin using these biomaterials at the site of cardiovascular diseases can have the advantage of regional high levels of hirudin, as well as lowering systemic hirudin exposure, thereby minimizing the possibility of side effects.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Pusan Natl Univ, Coll Pharm, Pusan 609735, South Korea","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Box 351750, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Kim, Dae Duk/D-8864-2013",,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 51260],,,13,11,11,0,7,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,,,PHARMACEUT RES,Pharm.

This approach enables us to make a clear analysis of the flow direction of the carbon fluxes in the metabolic pathways as well as of the degree of activation of a particular pathway for the synthesis of biomaterials for cell growth. The analyses demonstrate that the main metabolic pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae change significantly during batch culture. Carbon flow direction is toward glycolysis to satisfy the increase of requirement for precursors and energy. The enzymatic activation of TCA cycle seems to always be at normal level, which may result in the overflow of ethanol due to its limited capacity. The advantage of this approach is that it adopts both virtues of the metabolic signal flow diagram and the simple network analysis method, focusing on the investigation of the flow directions of carbon fluxes and the degree of activation of a particular pathway or reaction loop. All of the variables used in the model equations were determined an-line; the information obtained from the calculated metabolic coefficients may result in a better understanding of cell physiology and help to evaluate the state of the cell culture process.

Enrichment can govern both the surface chemistry and morphology of such surfaces. Here, we present new information on the surface enrichment of components from a biodegradable polymer blend composed of poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA). This information, derived by phase-detection imaging atomic force microscopy (AFM), defines both the surface chemistry and morphology. We demonstrate that phase-detection imaging can distinguish between microdomains of PSA and PLA in blends of these biodegradable polymers. Contrast between these two polymers is achieved even when the microdomains cannot be distinguished on surface topography images. The relationship between the force of tapping of the AFM probe on the polymer surface and the image contrast mechanism is investigated. In addition to detecting chemical and mechanical variations on polymer blend surfaces, phase-detection imaging can improve the resolution and contrast of images on single-component films. This is demonstrated by the identification of lamellae with widths of less than 5 nm within PSA spherulites.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; Ortho Clin Diagnost, Pollards Wood Labs, Chalfont St Giles HP8 4SP, Bucks, England; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Sch Pharm, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel","Davies, MC (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009","Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,29,61,66,4,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,APR 7,1998.0,31,7,,,,,2278,2283,,10.1021/ma9704525,,,,6,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,ZH163,WOS:000073079100034,,,,,2019-02-25

The surface structures of both the grafted membranes and the PP membrane were observed by using FTIR-PAS and ESCA methods. The X-ray diffraction diagrams of the PP and PP-g-HEMA membranes indicated a transformation process of the p-form toward the ct-form crystallinity with increasing degree of grafting. The SEM data of the membrane grafted under a low grafting temperature showed many spheres of PHEMA embedded in the PP matrix, whose size was well distributed and increased with the degree of grafting. The influences of the degree of grafting and grafting temperature on the permeabilities of PP-g-HEMA membranes toward urea and creatinine were studied in a dialyzer. In all cases, the PP-g-HEMA membrane obtained under higher grafting temperature showed higher permeability toward those solutes. The permeation coefficients of urea and creatinine through the PP-g-HEMA membrane obtained at 59 degrees C were about 10.4 and 28.8 times that through the PP membrane, respectively.

The physical strengths and behaviour of these fabrics under different external forces were measured for such stress-strain relationships as compressive, tensile and cyclic bending, compressing torsional and compressive tensile systems to evaluate the effect of the continuous loading caused by living body movements over a long period of time. The 3-DFs led to downward convex 'J'-shaped curves in stress-strain profiles, because they were markedly flexible at low strain levels, but became rigid as strain increased. In this behaviour they reflected the behaviour of natural cartilage rather than that of conventional artificial biomaterials. There were also some 3-DFs that showed hysteresis loss curves with quite similar mechanical strengths and behaviour to natural intervertebral discs with regard to the compressive-tensile cyclic stress and showed little variation from the first 'J'-shaped hysteresis profile even after 100, 000 deformation cycles. Accordingly, it has been shown that, without a doubt, 3-DFs can be effective implants possessing both design and mechanical biocompatibilities as well as the durability necessary for long-term implantation in the living body. The surface of bioinert linear low-density polyethylene coating on multifilaments of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, a constructional fibre of 3A-3D weaving, was modified by treatment with corona-discharge and spray-coating of unsintered hydroxyapatite powder to impart chemical (surface) compatibility and biological activity, respectively. Since the modified surface of the 3-DF was ascertained to have affinity and activity with simulated body fluid, an orthogonal 3-DF block was implanted in the tibia of a rabbit. Sufficient surrounding tissues entering into the textural space of the 3-DF could be observed at 4 weeks after implantation and the load necessary to break the block away from the bone reached a high value at 8 weeks. These results decisively showed that the 3-DFs could also acquire chemical (surface) and biological biocompatibilities and bonding capacity with bone and soft tissues through modification of the surface of the constructional fibre. The 3-DFs have definite potential in such applications as novel and effective artificial articular cartilages, intervertebral discs, menisci and materials for osteosynthesis and prosthesis, and the like.

Several polypropylene (PP) prostheses are currently available which differ in the number of PP filaments, the type of weave and the porosity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the integration, adhesion formation and resistance to traction of three types of PP prostheses (Marlex(R), Trelex(R) and Prolene(R)) used in the partial or total repair of abdominal wall defects. Abdominal wall defects (7 x 5 cm) were created in 54 New Zealand rabbits involving all the tissue layers (total substitutions (TS); n = 27) or all layers excluding the parietal peritoneum (partial substitutions (PS); it = 27). The defects were repaired with PP monofilament prostheses of different weave (1 mm porosity) (Marlex, n = 18; Trelex, n = 18) or bifilament (2 mm porosity) (Prolene; n = 18). They were placed in contact on one side with subcutaneous tissue and on the other with abdominal viscera or parietal peritoneum. Animals were killed at 30, 60 and 90 days and samples of prosthesis and scar tissue processed for light and scanning microscopy. The adhesion formation with viscera was evaluated. Resistance to traction was measured with a tensiometer using strips including the prosthesis and anchorage tissue. Adhesions were detected in all the TS and in four PS. Microscopic analysis revealed total integration of the TS samples by fibrous and disorganized tissue. Prostheses used for PS were integrated by white adipose tissue with the exception of the areas around the mesh nodes and anchorage zones. The foreign body reaction could be seen as a moderate accumulation of white blood cells. Tensiometric analysis showed an increase in resistance to traction with time (P < 0.001) in each type of prosthesis, but no differences were detected (P > 0.001) between them. We concluded that: (a) the formation of adhesions was almost inhibited when the parietal peritoneum was left intact; (b) in both TS and PS, polypropylene prostheses integrated completely although the composition of the scar tissue was seem to differ; and (c) resistance to traction was similar in both TS and PS.

The mechanical properties of the films are greatly affected by the presence of hydroxyapatite and change as a function of inorganic phase content. On stretching, the long axis of the collagen molecular portions align parallel to the direction of deformation and the gelatin coarse layered structure becomes more evident and ordered. Furthermore, under deformation the inorganic crystals, which are embedded in the gelatin layers, seem to squeeze out in the interlayer spaces and assume a preferential orientation parallel to the force trajectories. Thus, as the inorganic phase stiffens the gelatin films, the macromolecular matrix distributes the stress promoting the preferential orientation of the apatitic crystals. The results indicate that this experimental approach can be used to prepare composites with anisotropic properties, which can be modulated through variation in composition and mechanical deformation in order to get biomaterials suitable to fulfill specific mechanical functions.

For the development of new biomaterials with superior biocompatibility, quantitative evaluation of the materials' affinity for cells is necessary. One of the methods to evaluate the materials' affinity for cells quantitatively is to measure the detachment force of an adherent cell on a material. In this study, a new system was developed to measure directly the shear force necessary to detach a cell from a material. Using a microcantilever, the detachment force was measured in the cell culture medium by applying a lateral load to the cell which adhered to the material. During the measurement, the cell was observed using an optical microscope and the image of the cell was recorded on a video tape through a CCD camera. The cell adhesive area before detaching the cell was measured by analyzing the obtained video image of the cell. Reproducibility of the measurement was demonstrated by repeating the measurement of the shear forces to detach murine fibroblasts 1,929 incubated for 24 h on glass. The average shear strength, which is a detachment force per unit cell adhesive area, is 530-750 Pa, varying with the day of cell preparation. However, the shear strengths of the cells seeded at the same time into separate dishes are corresponding well to each other.

Defects were prepared in the edentulous area on both sides of the maxillas in 22 rabbits. The rabbits were divided into three groups. Gore-Tex(R) augmentation material (GTAM) (ePTFE)-barriers were placed to cover the experimental defects and compared with totally occlusive or perforated titanium foils and uncovered control defects respectively. After four weeks of healing, histological analyses and morphometrical measurements demonstrated that the amount of regenerated bone tissue was about the same underneath the collapsed GTAM-barriers as in the controls. The highest degree of regeneration was obtained in defects underneath the titanium foils, particularly if they were perforated, whether or not they were covered by GTAM-barriers. It was concluded that the space-maintaining properties of a barrier may be at least as important as barrier occlusiveness when regenerating bone defects.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Biomat Handicap Res, Inst Surg Sci, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; Inst Postgrad Dent Educ, Dept Periodontol, Jonkoping, Sweden","Lundgren, AK (reprint author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Biomat Handicap Res, Inst Surg Sci, Medicinaregatan 8, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,24,39,41,0,1,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0901-5027,1399-0020,,INT J ORAL MAX SURG,Int.

However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have empirically examined academic scientists' experience with research-related gifts from companies. Objective.-To examine the frequency, importance, and potential implications of research-related gifts from companies to academic life scientists. Design.-A mailed survey conducted in 1994 and 1995 of 3394 faculty who conduct life science research at the 50 universities that received the most research funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1993. Setting.-Research-intensive universities. Participants.-A total of 2167 of the 3394 faculty responded to the survey (response rate, 64%). Main Outcome Measures.-The percentage of faculty who received a research-related gift from a company in the last 3 years, the perceived importance of gifts to respondents' research, and what, if anything, the recipient thought the donor(s) expected in return for the gift. Results.-Forty-three percent of respondents received a research-related gift in the last 3 years independent of a grant or contract. The most frequently received gifts were biomaterials (24%), discretionary funds (15%), research equipment and trips to meetings (11% each), support for students (9%), and other research-related gifts (3%). Of those who received a gift, 66% reported the gift was important to their research, More than half of the recipients reported that donors expected the following in return for the gift: acknowledgment in publications (63%), that the gift not be passed on to a third party (60%), and that the gift be used only for the agreed-on purposes (59%). A total of 32% of recipients reported that the donor wanted prepublication review of any articles or reports stemming from the use of the gift, 30% indicated the company expected testing of their products, and 19% indicated that a donor expected ownership of all patentable results from the research in which a gift was used. However, what recipients thought donors expected differed by the type of gift received. Conclusions.-Research-related gifts are a common and important form of research support for academic life scientists. However, recipients frequently think that donors place restrictions and expect returns that may be problematic for recipients as well as institutions.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Hlth Policy Res & Dev Unit, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Partners Healthcare Syst Inc, Boston, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Minnesota, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Minneapolis, MN USA","Campbell, EG (reprint author), Med Practices Evaluat Ctr, Hlth Policy Res & Dev Unit, 50 Staniford St,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",,,"Seashore, Karen/0000-0003-1070-0273",NHGRI NIH HHS [HG00724-01],,,12,85,87,0,3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0098-7484,,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This was achieved at 17 MPa, 750 degrees C for 10 min. Only the tops of the granules, which were surrounded by the alloy, remained exposed and they were firmly stuck in the substrate. The granules were enclosed in titanium-alloy and a reaction layer was formed at their interface.

While the requirements of mechanical properties can be reached by suitable organo-polymeric and inorganic materials the interfacial biocompatiblity is neither understood in all its complexity nor can be fulfilled by any of the applied materials. Surface modification and characterization with greatest scrutiny and the observation of the answer of selected parameters of the biosystem are a subject of utmost interest. A few examples will be presented. In the long range, however, it has to be considered that any material is degraded and hence should present continuously a renewable biocompatible surface. On the other hand, materials are desired which deliberately are biodegradable. Presently available materials are polylactides and copolymers. An alternative could be presented by polydepsipeptides because of two reasons, (i) the local concentration of acid formed upon degradation would be reduced as compared to polylactides which in certain cases might be advantageous and (ii) the aminoacid units could carry side groups with bioactive molecules attached. Therefore, a new method of acylation of an aminoacid with a hydroxyacid is presented as well as the cyclisation to result in the cyclic depsipeptide and the polymerisation to yield the polydepsipeptide. The microstructure of the polymers, the thermal properties and the degradation behaviour is presented.","Univ Technol Aachen, Ctr Competence Biomat, Aachen, Germany; Univ Technol Aachen, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res, Aachen, Germany","Hocker, H (reprint author), Univ Technol Aachen, Ctr Competence Biomat, Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,6,6,6,0,10,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

In vitro IMC release from the 1, 2 and 5% drug-loaded apatite cement systems in simulated body fluid (SBF) (pH 7.25) at 37 degrees C increased with increasing concentrations of IMC and with decreasing geometrical size of the cement. The plots of in vitro IMC release per unit area against the square root of time increased with increasing IMC concentrations, but not with decreasing geometrical size of the cement. After subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of differently sized 1% IMC-loaded cements in male Wistar rats, the plasma IMC concentration and the area under the curve increased with decreasing cement diameter. The in vivo IMC release profiles of the cement were deconvoluted from the plasma IMC profiles after s.c. administration of IMC solution. The plots of in vivo IMC release per unit area against the square root of time suggested that the initial release from all 1% drug-loaded cements was very rapid, slowed after one day, but continued for over two weeks.

Covalent binding was achieved in a two-step procedure: First, TGF-beta 2 was reacted with the difunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker, and then the PEG-attached TGF-beta 2 (PEG-TGF-beta 2) was bound to the fibrillar collagen (FC-PEG-TGF-beta 2). Initial binding of TGF-beta 2 to difunctional succinimidyl glutarate (D-SG-PEG) or succinimidyl propionate polyethylene glycol (D-SE-PEG) linkers was completed after reacting for 8 or 10 min as monitored by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. After reaction with injectable fibrillar collagen, extraction of unbound PEG-TGF-beta 2 and Western blot analysis, using a TGF-beta specific antibody, demonstrated that at least 85% of the TGF-beta 2 was bound to the fibrillar collagen. The activity of PEG-TGF-beta 2 was fully stable in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C for at least up to 4 weeks. Unmodified TGF-beta 2 mixed with fibrillar collagen was completely inactivated after 1 week of incubation, as measured by the mink lung epithelial cell (Mv1Lu) growth inhibition assay. Formulations of FC-PEG-TGF-beta 2 containing 40 mu g/mL TGF-beta 2 were implanted subcutaneously into rats and analyzed after days 7, 21, and 42. All TGF-beta 2-containing formulations showed. the TGF-beta typical fibroblastic response at the day 7 time point. Covalent binding of TGF-beta 2 to collagen with both difunctional PEG crosslinkers resulted in a significantly stronger and longer-lasting TGF-beta 2 response than that observed with admired formulations of collagen and TGF-beta. The TGF-beta response with FC-PEG-TGF-beta 2 lasted up to day 42 but was not seen after day 7 for TGF-beta 2 admired to FC. These findings clearly demonstrate that TGF-beta 2 remains fully active after being covalently bound to collagen via difunctional PEG. In addition, covalent binding potentiates and prolongs in vivo TGF-beta responses and stabilizes the TGF-beta in vitro. Results suggest that this method of formulation could be useful to stabilize and deliver similar peptide growth factors or biologically active agents.

The expression of adhesion molecules analyzed by flow cytometry provides a simple method to evaluate leukocyte activation by biomaterials: any change in these molecules can be predictive of the inflammatory activity of the materials. In this study the contact between leukocytes and uncoated polyethylene terephthalate or pyrolytic carbon-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET and PET-PC, respectively) was inspected by analyzing whether the expression of some adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte activation, namely LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac 1/CR3 (CD11b/CD18), and LECAM-1 (CD62L) can be modified. By flow cytometry expression of the adhesion molecules can be studied separately on lymphocytes and myeloid cells. The materials tested reduced the total numbers of both leukocytes and neutrophils, although not significantly. Neither PET nor PET-PC changed the expression of the adhesion molecules in lymphocytes: this suggests that no specific immune response is stimulated. On the contrary, statistically significant changes were observed for monocytes and granulocytes: the percentage of cells expressing Mac-1 and the density of such antigens on cell membranes increased while the percentage of LECAM-1 positive cells decreased. Similar changes were observed when the cells underwent the inflammatory stimulus provided by an in vitro challenge with bacterial endotoxin. Our results demonstrated that polyethylene terephthalate activates leukocytes by modifying the expression in neutrophils of the molecules involved in the early phase of the inflammatory response. Even after coating PET with pyrolytic carbon, the ability of this material to activate circulating leukocytes was maintained.

In this study, the effects of 14 metal ions on histamine release from human blood basophils (n = 4), isolated tissue mast cells (lung n = 8, uterus n = 2, skin n = 1, gingiva n = 1), the basophil cell line KU-812, and the mast cell line HMC-1 were analyzed. Of the 14 metal ions, Ag+ (0.33 mM) and Hg2+ (0.33 mM) were found to induce release of histamine in blood basophils, KU-812 mast cells, and HMC-1. The effects of Ag+ and Hg2+ were dose dependent and were observed within 60 min of incubation. In primary mast cells and basophils, Au3+ (0.33 mM) also induced histamine release, whereas no effects of Au3+ on HMC-1 or KU-812 cells were seen. The other metal ions showed no effects on primary or immortal cells within 60 min. However, Pt4+ (0.33 mM) induced histamine liberation in HMC-1 and lung mast cells after 12 h. The Ag+ - and Hg2+-induced rapid release of histamine from HMC-1 was associated with ultrastructural signs of necrosis, but not apoptosis. In contrast, prolonged exposure to Pt4+ (0.33 mM, 14 h) induced apoptotic cell death in HMC-1 cells, as assessed by electron microscopy and DNA analysis. Together, certain metal ions induce distinct cytopathogenic effects in mast cells and basophils. Whereas Ag+, Hg2+, and Au3+ cause direct toxicity, Pt4+ causes cell death through induction of apoptosis. Whether such effects contribute to local adverse reactions to metal-containing biomaterials in vivo remains to be determined.

For this purpose, selected samples of the tissue were sewn with different types of commercially available sutures and subjected to tensile testing, the results of which were compared with the findings in selected, but not sutured, tissue used as a control. The results confirm a loss of resistance-that is, a reduction of the capacity of sutured samples of the biomaterial to withstand and breakage stress compared with control samples. Taking into account the marked resistance to breakage of the suture thread, this phenomenon can only be explained as a consequence of the deleterious mechanical interaction between the suture and chemically treated pericardium. This interaction is illustrated by the shearing force which is responsible for the loss of resistance in the tested samples. These trials demonstrate that the results can be improved and the deleterious interaction diminished, although not eliminated, when the pericardium is selected from a given region.

Both the sintered carbonate apatite and the bone apatite dissolved to an appreciable extent. Their solution compositions chanced in an almost identical manner until toward the end of the reaction. The solution compositions for sintered carbonate apatite at 30 s was comparable with that for sintered hydroxyapatite at 3.8 days with respect to the degree of supersaturation, indicating that the former specimen is much more soluble than the latter specimen. Osteoclasts which were obtained from the long bones of 1-day-old neonatal rabbits resorbed bone and sintered carbonate apatite, but not sintered hydroxyapatite. These findings suggest that sintered carbonate apatites, which have characteristics that can be favorably compared with those of bone, especially with respect to its reactivity to acid media, would be useful as bioresorbable bone substitutes.

Undecalcified interfacial tissues were serially sectioned from mandibular samples encasing 60 implants placed into 30 dogs. Two-dimensional ultrastructural analyses and three-dimensional stereology showed that osteogenesis adjacent to dental implants is a dynamic interaction of osseous cells and a collagenous fiber matrix. This study showed that the interfacial bone consists of a mineralized collagen fiber matrix associated with an inorganic (hydroxylapatite) matrix. This study suggested that an unmineralized collagen fiber matrix initially is laid down directly at the implant surface, and that this matrix then is mineralized. Osteoblasts interacted with this matrix, eventually becoming encased within developing lacunae during the remodeling process. This process formed the cellular (osteocyte) aspects of the developed bone. Osteocyte processes extended through canaliculi directly to the implant surface. Apparently, these processes also were entrapped within canaliculi during the mineralization events. At times, these processes paralleled the implant surface. The bone-implant interfacial zone was primarily fibrillar (both mineralized and unmineralized) in morphology, with an electron-dense, ruthenium positive deposition. This electron-dense material was approximately 20 to 50 nanometers in thickness, and only this thin layer separated the remodeled mineralized bone from the implant.

The volume, number of cells, and concentration of fibrinogen were determined in the exudate for the three biomaterials. The exudate was analyzed using a flow cytometry technique after labeling of the leukocytes with a monoclonal anti-CD45 antibody. Fibrinogen rose progressively over the 3-week period for the three polymers. After the different leukocyte lines were identified in rat blood samples, their determination in the exudate revealed differences among the three biomaterials. At day 2, PVC induced a predominantly neutrophilic inflammatory reaction whereas PU and SIL gave a mixture of monocytes and neutrophils. At day 9, the aspect of the cytograms was different, but the identification of the subpopulations was still possible. At day 23, the number of cell events became too low to distinguish the subpopulations. An even more detailed approach might be possible using specific labeling for each leukocyte line to establish a comparison among the three biomaterials.

Development of improved ureteral stent biomaterials capable of preventing or reducing encrustation is therefore particularly desirable. In this study, the suitability as a ureteral stent biomaterial of Aquavene(R), a novel poly(ethylene oxide)/polyurethane composite hydrogel was compared with that of silicone and polyurethane, two materials widely employed in ureteral stent manufacture. Examination of Aquavene(R) in dry and hydrated states by confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy showed the presence of numerous channels within a cellular matrix structure. The channel size increased considerably to as much as 10 mu m in diameter in the hydrated state. Aquavene(R) provided superior resistance to encrustation and intraluminal blockage over a 24-week period in a simulated urine flow model. Unobstructed urine flow continued with Aquavene(R) at 24 weeks, whereas silicone and polyurethane stents became blocked with encrustation at 8 and 10 weeks, respectively. Weight loss within Aquavene(R) on the order of 9% (w/w) over the 24-week flow period indicates that extraction of the noncrosslinked poly(ethylene oxide) hydrogel may be responsible for the prevention of encrustation blockage of this biomaterial. In the dry state, Aquavene(R) was significantly harder than either silicone or polyurethane, as shown by Young's modulus, and rapidly became soft on hydration. These additional properties of Aquavene(R) would facilitate ease of stent insertion in the dry state past obstructions in the ureter and provide improved patient comfort on subsequent biomaterial hydration in situ. Aquavene(R) is a promising candidate for use in the urinary tract, as it is probable that effective longterm urine drainage would be maintained in vivo. Further evaluation of this novel biomaterial is therefore warranted.

The multiphasic material used was composed of a 2% aqueous solution of methylhydroxypropylcellulose (MHPC) and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP, 60% hydroxyapatite and 40% beta-tricalcium phosphate) in which MHPC served as the carrier for 80-200 mu m of BCP granules. The best BCP/polymer ratio was determined by the rheological properties and higher BCP content of the material. Steam sterilization was more effective than gamma irradiation in maintaining the stability of the mixture and conserving its physiochemical and mechanical properties. The in vitro biocompatibility of the composite was checked by direct-contact cytotoxicity and cell-proliferation assays. A preliminary in vivo test was performed in the rabbit using intraosseous implantations in the femoral epiphysis. Histological analysis was done after 1, 2, 4, and 10 weeks. Bone ingrowth into the IBS, in close association with BCP granules, was observed after 1 week and increased regularly from the surface inward at 2, 4, and 10 weeks. At the same time, smaller BCP granules (less than 80 microns in diameter) were degraded and resorbed. This injectable biomaterial proved suitable for cavity filling.

The results have led to a model of plasminogen interactions with epsilon-amino groups, This paper focuses on the desorption kinetics of plasminogen adsorbed to this material, Plasminogen is shown to bind to the dipeptide in at least four different ways to the epsilon-amino groups. It is suggested that some molecules bind to several epsilon-amino groups at the same time. The surface plasmon resonance analysis also indicates that the interaction of Glu-plasminogen with L-lysine is very complex and may not be defined simply by discrete kringle interactions alone, Dissociation constants ranging from 0.1 s(-1) to less than 5 x 10(-7) s(-1) are observed.

Only Ti-6Al-4V ELI and Ti-6Al-7Nb have been standardized for biomaterials in ASTM among various titanium alloys. Ti-6Al-4V ELI is a representative titanium alloy used as an alternative artificial metallic material for failed hard tissue. The implant materials for alternative use to failed hard tissue are often used under cyclic loading. The principal cause of implant failure is fatigue fracture. The fatigue strength is one of the most important properties for implant materials. There is a possibility for the implant materials to be fractured under monotonic loading conditions during fatigue, consequently the prediction of the fatigue life of the implant materials is important. An evaluation of the fracture characteristics of fatigued implant materials will offer information about the residual fatigue life and the residual fracture resistance of these materials. The relationship between fatigue damage and mechanical properties in Ti-6Al-4V ELI with equiaxed alpha structure were investigated in this study. The tensile strength of fatigued specimens of Ti-6Al-4V ELI with equiaxed alpha structure increases rapidly within the low-cycle-fatigue region. On the other hand, the elongation of fatigued specimens tested at various fatigue increments decreases rapidly within the low-cycle-fatigue region. The energy absorbed by fatigued specimens during various fatigue steps decreases rapidly in the late stages of the low-cycle-fatigue region. Furthermore, a hardness gradient develops initially from the surface to the inside of the specimens, and then in the later stages of fatigue, the internal hardness is equal to the surface hardness. The sub-structures both near and far from the surface of fatigued specimens, observed after various fatigue steps, show an increased dislocation density. However, at the late stages of low-cycle-fatigue, the dislocation density far from the specimen surface, also increases dramatically. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

This putative interaction was examined by quantifying the adhesion of M187 (PS/A+, slime+) parent strain and isogenic transposon mutant strain sn3 (PS/A-, slime-) to polyethylene (PE) under a range of physiologic shear stress conditions in both phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% platelet poor plasma (PPP). No significant differences in adhesion were noted between the M187 and sn3 strains in either test medium. However, adhesion of both strains in 1% PPP was decreased 75-95% compared to adhesion in PBS. In PBS, adhesion was shear stress dependent from 0-15 dyne/cm(2), after which adhesion was comparatively shear stress independent. Adhesion in 1% PPP was independent of shear stress. Epifluorescent imaging of both strains labeled for slime confirmed the presence of slime on the surface of M187 and suggested that PS/A and slime promote the formation of large aggregates, as aggregates were totally absent in the images of the sn3 strain. The results suggest that PS/A and slime do not mediate S. epidermidis adhesion to bare PE or PE with adsorbed plasma proteins, but may be necessary for intercellular adhesion, which is important for biofilm formation.

The technique is based upon the well-known concept of tracking translating laser speckle with a linear array CCD camera, but employs a unique data-processing scheme based upon a two-dimensional frequency transform of the data. The method proved to be successful in evaluating strain rates in the bone samples. Measured strain rates ranged between 4.61 and 23.84 mu epsilon/s. Total strains recorded were between 3.7 and 19.1 mu epsilon. Estimated Young's moduli averaged 9.01 +/- 3.93 GPa, which, considering the extremely slow strain rates, is an acceptable value for porcine cortical bone. General advantages of the technique include high sensitivity, insensitivity to zero-mean noise sources, compact design, and the fact that it is truly noncontact. A brief discussion of possible error sources within the method is also given.

The material most widely used in clinical medicine is hydroxyapatite. The aim of our investigation was to study the effect of hydroxyapatite size mechanism on osteoblasts. The osteoblasts were cultured in vitro with 0.1% (1 mg/mL) of various sized hydroxyapatite particles (0.5-3.0, 37-63, 177-250, and 420-841 mu m) for 1 h, 3 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days. The results showed that adding hydroxyapatite particles to osteoblast culturs can significantly affect osteoblast cell count. Osteoblast populations decreased significantly. Osteoblast mean surface areas also changed significantly. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations in culture medium decreased significantly with the addition of hydroxyapatite particles. Prostaglandin E-2, (PGE(2)) concentrations in medium increased significantly. The changes in TGF-beta 1 and PGE(2), concentration were more significant and persisted longer in smaller-particle groups. The inhibitory effects of hydroxyapatite particles on osteoblast cell cultures were mediated by the increased synthesis of PGE(2). Caution should be exercised before using a hydroxyapatite product which could easily break down into fine particles.

From immunologic studies it is known that inflammatory reactions can be modulated by use of (anti)-growth factors or anti-inflammatory drugs. Before this can be employed with respect to biomaterials, the role of individual factors (humoral and cellular) has to be studied. In this part of the investigation, the role of T cells was studied by use of T-cell-deficient (nude) rats and control (AO) rats. Hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked dermal sheep collagen (HDSC) was selected as the test material. The results showed that T cells or T cell-related factors played a prominent role in the attraction of macrophages and the formation of giant-cells, their antigen presentation, and their phagocytotic capacity. As a consequence, degradation of HDSC was strongly delayed. This study also showed that infiltration of fibroblasts and creation of stromal areas in HDSC was restricted to areas subjected to degradation. However, in time, absence of T cells resulted in increased formation and maturation of autologous rat collagen. Results obtained suggest that the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials might be modulated by controlling T-cell activation.

Human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured on tissue culture grade polystyrene (PS), and two model poly(urethane)s were synthesized from (1) polycaprolactone (PCL) and (2) polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO), both with 2, 4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and ethylene diamine (ED). The increase in CE and total protein per cell were measured on days 8 and 28 in culture and normalized to the DNA content per cell. At day 8 there consistently were fewer cells remaining on the PTMO-based polymer than on the PCL-based polymer or the PS (p < 0.05). When comparing day 28 to day 8, there was more CE activity and protein per cell on all materials. However, there was a disproportionate synthesis of CE per mg of total protein on PS and TDI/PCL/ED whereas on PTMO there was not. Significantly, there was more protein and CE per cell on PTMO than on PS or TDI/PCL/ED (p < 0.05). This in vitro model system of the chronic phase of inflammation has shown that it is possible to culture monocytes for a month and assess the material surface itself as a potent activator of the differentiation into macrophages without secondary stimulation. Since CE has been shown to degrade poly(ether and ester)based poly(urethane)s, the differential production of this enzyme relative to the total protein on different surfaces may impact on the potential long-term biostability of an implanted material.

Of the several possible pathways, this study focuses on the amount of cAMP that accumulated in NIH 3T3 cells during the first 45 min after the cells contacted the bioincompatible membrane Cuprophan (CU) and the biocompatible membrane AN69. The cells that adhered to CU contained more cAMP than those that attached to AN69. This might be because the cells did not spread but remained rounded up under scanning electron microscopy. There was no increase in cAMP in the cells that did not adhere to CU. The cAMP-modulating agents, forskolin and isoproterenol, were used to assess the cAMP-generating capacity of adenylylcyclase in cells adhering to CU and AN69. This capacity was not affected by a high concentration (100 mu M) of forskolin. Isoproterenol had no effect on the cAMP content of the cells, demonstrating that beta adrenergic receptors are not implicated in the activation of cAMP production by membranes. The bioincompatibility of CU seems to he responsible for the greater amount of cAMP in adherent cells, and this parameter could provide an index for assessing biocompatibility.

The integrity of the microfibrillar structure was confirmed by optical and scanning electronic microscopy. The results indicate that the glutaraldehyde acetals procedure may be of potential use for the crosslinking of bovine pericardium used in the manufacture of bioprosthetic devices. Advantages may be related to the production of materials with homogeneous crosslinking distributions, associated with better definition in the nature of the chemical link that they introduce, due to a better distribution of glutaraldehyde within the tissue matrix before the crosslinking reaction is allowed to occur.

The partial staining of activated proteins indicates that immobilization of EGF inhibited the free lateral diffusion and internalization of the activated EGF-EGF receptor complex. The enhanced cell growth is due to juxtacrine stimulation realized by immobilized EGF.","Kyoto Univ, Fac Engn, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem Mat, Kyoto 60601, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Kyoto 61902, Japan","Ito, Y (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Fac Engn, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem Mat, Kyoto 60601, Japan.",,"Ito, Yoshihiro/F-4370-2012",,,,,21,86,88,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1043-1802,,,BIOCONJUGATE CHEM,Bioconjugate Chem.,MAR-APR,1998.0,9,2,,,,,277,282,,10.1021/bc970190b,,,,6,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Organic",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,ZD130,WOS:000072654400018,9548545.0,,,,2019-02-25

Determination of the cell-substrate contact area is necessary in order to understand how biomaterial properties influence cell adhesion. In this review we describe the development and application of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to quantify the separation distance of cells from a biomaterial surface. An approximate theory is presented for the straightforward calculation of separation distances when a fluor is placed in the cell membrane. The validity of this approach is discussed. TIRFM is compared to interference reflection microscopy and related techniques that measure cell/substrate separation distances. This approach is then applied to a number of important problems in cell substrate interactions, including changes in contact area and adhesion strength on biomaterial surfaces, analysis of bond strength, and real-time measurement of cell/substrate separation distances following exposure to flow.

Cells that interact with the implant will be reacting to a layer (single or multiple) of adsorbed protein. The parameters of importance in a study of protein adsorption to surfaces of biomaterial interest include total amounts of different adsorbed proteins and the conformation and orientation of these adsorbed proteins. Researchers have developed a number of techniques with which we can now address all these questions. In this paper, we have discussed how Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) techniques can be used for the study of biomaterial surfaces and events at biomaterial surfaces such as protein adsorption. FTIR spectroscopy offers higher signal-to-noise and speeds than spectrometers that use gratings and hence offers the capability of observing the critical early events when proteins interact with surfaces. Perhaps the biggest advantage of the FTIR technique over dispersive spectrometers is wavelength precision. This allows the subtraction of water, a strong infrared absorber, from the spectra of proteins in aqueous solutions. This review starts with an introduction of how ATR can be used to provide information about proteins on surfaces. Equations to calculate the amount of proteins adsorbed to surfaces from analysis of ATR spectra are presented. A discussion of the kinds of surfaces that can be analyzed by FTIR/ATR and difficulties with the subtraction of H2O is given. The rest of the review deals with how information of interest to biomaterials researchers such as kinetics of protein adsorption, changes in protein secondary structure and orientation upon adsorption to surfaces can be obtained by FTIR/ATR.

The movement of fibrinogen-gold conjugates was observed in real time using video-enhanced interference reflection microscopy (VEIRM) and the redistribution of fluorescein-labelled fibrinogen was examined using video-intensified epifluorescence microscopy (VIFM). Fibrinogen was picked up by spreading platelets and moved rewards the centre of the platelets. The velocity of the movement of fibrinogen-gold conjugates under the ventral membrane ranged from less than 0.1 mu m min(-1) to more than 10 mu m min(-1). The average velocity in the peripheral web region was more than 6 mu m min(-1), and was reduced to around 1 mu m min(-1) in the outer and inner filamentous zones. The centralized fibrinogen molecules were internalized and eventually removed from the platelets.

One interesting feature of the method is the possibility of detailed and accurate determination of real-time adsorption kinetics of proteins without labelling of the protein. It is else possible to detect protein adsorption with the use of antibodies that adsorb onto the antigen-coated surfaces and to detect antibodies by their adsorption behaviour with regard to antigen-coated surfaces. Compared to other solid phase methods such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay, ellipsometry has the advantage of not involving any labelling of the reactant and it is a relatively inexpensive method to maintain. This review is a current report of 15 years of contributions in biomaterials and biochemical research. Special consideration has been given to biologically related surface phenomena such as protein conformation changes, protein displacement effects, early events in blood clotting and complement activation. Among the technical achievements given prominence are the wettability gradient method and the rational use of silicon as an experimental surface. It is clear that ellipsometry and related methods such as reflectometry and surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) are now being increasingly used in biomaterial research as well as in other areas of research.

In this contribution we review briefly applications of infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and ellipsometry as tools for analysis of the chemical properties of model surfaces, and their biological response in vitro when in contact with blood plasma or serum, respectively. The strength of the combination of the techniques is demonstrated by determination of protein adsorption patterns on a series of chemically well-defined so-called self-assembled alkanethiolate monolayers (SAMs) of 16-thiohexadecanol (HS-(CH2)(16)-OH) and n-hexadecanethiol (HS-(CH2)(15)-CH3) on gold.

Until recently, such processes could not be observed directly. Over the past decade, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has provided mechanistic insights into the molecular level interactions that occur at the biomaterial interface. Several unique operational modes have been developed which utilize intermittent contact with the sample and decrease applied shear forces. These dynamic modes also can be used to study the role of different structural components on biomaterial micromechanical properties. Force detection techniques allow molecular level studies of individual receptor-ligand binding events, and force mapping for determining structure/function relationships. Advancements in tip manufacturing, image processing techniques, the use of model surfaces and labeling all have contributed to the advancement of the AFM as a state-of-the-art research instrument.

Among the many surface analytical tools, AES has been shown to be very effective for surface composition analysis. These analyses are critically needed to better understand the interactions between the host and implant. The use of AES for titanium (Ti) and hydroxyapatite (HA) biomaterials characterization is demonstrated in this paper. The relative peak heights of TiL2,3M2,3V can be used as 'fingerprints' for TiO2 surfaces which have undergone different degrees of reduction. Similarly, for HA coatings, a shift in the phosphorus Auger peaks to a higher kinetic energy indicates the presence of a phosphate group, with strong P-O bonds. Depth compositional profiling and thin-film analysis can be performed using AES. In our studies, oxide thicknesses on Ti surfaces range from 36.8 +/- 7.4 Angstrom to 436 +/- 49 Angstrom depending on the surface treatment. Depth profiling can also be used to determine the subsurface composition of biomaterials. For HA coatings, a phosphorus concentration at the oxide/metal interface has been observed to be higher than at the outermost oxide surface. The HA coatings have also been observed to coexist within the titanium oxide, suggesting the occurrence of chemical bonding between the coatings and the metallic substrates. However, like other analytical tools, AES has its limitations. The electron beam damage can severely limit useful analysis of organic and biological materials and occasionally ceramic materials. Carbide buildup during long beam exposure times has been shown to affect the relative peak-to-peak intensities of the oxygen and metal Auger signals. The determination of film thickness requires a standard of known thickness and depth profiling of overlapping peaks can be very problematic. Even with these limitation, AES can be a powerful analytical tool for the characterization of biomaterial surfaces. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The situation of dental biomaterials is considered with special reference to glass-ionomer polyelectrolyte systems and to the impedance changes that may arise in consequence of setting mechanisms. Measurements have been conducted using both static and frequency-dependent potentials; where appropriate, with a high impedance interface and frequency-response analyser. Data are presented for the control situation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and for a series of glass-ionomer and resin-modified glass-ionomer biomaterials. It is observed that in the glass-polyalkenoate (G-PA) materials, ionic conduction and polarization are the dominant factors contributing to the impedance. This contrasts with the dipolar relaxation characteristic of PMMA. It is concluded that a more extended programme of data-acquisition is required, where possible from a 'homologous' series of formulations, to lay a firm foundation of mechanistic interpretation.

The heads were paired with polyethylene (UHMWPE) discs in a ball-on-disc machine. The abrasive wear resistance of the heads increased with surface hardness, and qualitatively differing patterns of wear were observed on the UHMWPE surfaces, depending on the abrasive wear of the matching areas of the heads.

Methods: In each of ten dogs, BP was placed in one lung and ePTFE in the other. The implants were retrieved at 30, 95, or 167 days after implantation and studied histologically. The connective tissue covering the implants was measured and analysis of variance tvas used to compare results with the two materials. Results: At 30 days, the BP specimens showed focal chronic inflammation and thin tissue coverage, whereas the ePTFE specimens had no focal inflammation and thick tissue coverage. At 95 and 167 days, the inflammation in the BP specimens had resolved, but tissue coverage remained minimal, and there was no resorption of the BP. In the ePTFE specimens, tissue coverage had increased. Analysis of variance comparing representative tissue specimens showed that the tissue encapsulating the ePTFE was significantly thicker than that surrounding the BP (P < 0.0001). No air leaks, staple-line disruptions, or infections occurred in the study. Conclusions: Neither ePTFE nor BP is resorbable. Both materials have been used successfully, without resultant infections, for clinical staple-line reinforcement. The more favorable tissue response to ePTFE observed in this study may have clinical ramifications. Comparative clinical studies of the two materials are needed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The biotechnological applications focus on the aspects of cellular growth or delivery of proteins capable of stimulating cellular response. However, basic knowledge about collagen biochemistry and the processing technology in combination with understanding of the physico-chemical properties is necessary for an adequate application of collagen for carrier systems. The purpose of this review article is to summarize information available on collagen dosage forms for drug delivery as well as to impart an overview of the chemical structures and the galenical properties including detailed description of the processing steps - extraction, purification, chemical crosslinking and sterilization. The most successful and stimulating applications are shields in ophthalmology, injectable dispersions for local tumor treatment, sponges carrying antibiotics and minipellets loaded with protein drugs. However, the scientific information about manipulating release properties or mechanistic studies is not as abundant as for some synthetic polymers.

The interactions of osteoblasts with different substrates can be measured in terms of cytotoxicity, attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. The osteoblast culture systems that produce an osteoblast matrix opposing implant material substrates provide one model for evaluating the implant-bone inter face. Alterations in osteoblast behavior at different culture substrates ma) reflect clinical determinants of bone formation at these substrates in vivo; however, cell responses in vitro have not been compared or correlated with in vivo outcomes. Legitimate interpretations of in vitro experiments are discussed in terms of practical, technical, and biologic limitations presented by the cell culture approach. Cell culture provides access to molecular and cellular information that fosters nanostructural engineering approaches to implant design and significant hypotheses to be tested in vivo. In this way, cell culture offers unique insights into the process and phenomenon of osseointegration.","Univ N Carolina, Sch Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Dent Res Ctr,Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Cooper, LF (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Dent Res Ctr,Dept Biochem & Biophys, 302 Brauer Hall,CB 7450, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",,,"Cooper, Lyndon/0000-0002-6577-781X",,,,106,124,130,0,9,QUINTESSENCE PUBL CO INC,CAROL STREAM,"551 NORTH KIMBERLY DR, CAROL STREAM, IL 60188-1881 USA",0882-2786,,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

An indirect central flattening is induced by a peripheral steepening related to the segments. This surgery was recently approved in Europe, but is still under evaluation in the multicenter study controled by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). We took part in that protocol and report our results at one year follow-up. Material and method Twenty-five patients were included in the study with 47 operated eyes and a follow-up between 3 to 18 months. Data relative to refractive results, quality of the vision and anatomic changes induced by intra stromal segments will be collected at the issue of a rigourous survey. Results At one year, non-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 100% and 20/20 in 60%. We noted no loss in best visual acuity and an improvement of one or two lines in 20% of operated eyes. No significative changes were observed concerning : intraocular pressure, corneal sensitivity, central pachymetry or corneal endothelium. Three eyes had to be explanted and recovered the preoperative refraction. No severe complications were observed. Discussion Analysis of results is in favor of the efficacy, predictibility and reproductibility of the surgery, which might be better with rings of a diameter under 0.40 mm. Occurrence of postoperative astigmatism appears to constitue the main limit suggesting discussion on etiologic factors and modalities of treatment. Conclusion This concept of intra-corneal rings appears particularely, promising for correction of low myopia and maybe in the near future for correction of others ametropia, requiring design of new specific segments. Essential interest of this surgery is the respect of rite central area and its potential reversibility.","Hop Morvan, Serv Ophtalmol, F-29609 Brest, France","Colin, J (reprint author), Hop Morvan, Serv Ophtalmol, F-29609 Brest, France.",,,,,,,13,18,18,0,0,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0181-5512,,,J FR OPHTALMOL,J.

Setting: A British teaching hospital eye department. Methods: Ninety eyes were prospectively randomized to receive a PMMA, silicone, or AcrySof IOL. All lenses had 6.0 mm optics with PMMA haptics. A standardized surgical protocol was performed by a single surgeon using an extracapsular technique with capsulorhexis; eyes that experienced a surgical complication were excluded. All patients had standardized postoperative medication and follow-up. Specular microscopy of the anterior IOL surface was carried out after pupil dilation on days 1, 7, 30, 90, 180, 360, and 720 to assess small cell and giant cell reactions. Results: All three IOL types produced a mild degree of nonspecific foreign-body response, which resolved over the study period without detrimental effect. The silicone group had significantly higher small cell counts than the PMMA and AcrySof groups (P = .02); the AcrySof group had significantly lower giant cell counts than the other two groups (P = .003). Conclusion: The three IOL types were sufficiently biocompatible to function in normal eyes with age-related cataracts. However, AcrySof IOLs were associated with lower giant cell counts than PMMA and silicone IOLs and might produce better results in eyes with pre-existing blood-aqueous barrier damage.","St Thomas Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, London SE1 7EH, England","Spalton, DJ (reprint author), St Thomas Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Lambeth Palace Rd, London SE1 7EH, England.",,,,,,,19,115,129,0,13,AMER SOC CATARACT REFRACTIVE SURGERY,FAIRFAX,"4000 LEGATO RD, SUITE 850, FAIRFAX, VA 22030 USA",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed binding of this protein to the surface of polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and a polyurethane, Chronoflex, after water washing, but only trace levels could be detected on two polymethacrylate derivatives, polymethyl methacrylate and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). alpha-1-m was selectively desorbed from the five materials by sequential washes of serum-conditioned surfaces with isopropanol solutions at increasing concentrations. The presence of alpha-1-m in the washing supernatants was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The relative binding strength of alpha-1-m to each surface was evaluated as the isopropanol (IsoPOH) concentration required to desorb the protein from that surface. Analysis of bound proteins by SDS-PAGE conclusively demonstrated the binding of a range of serum proteins, including alpha-1-m, to all polymer systems, but with varying binding strengths. The majority of protein was removed by water washing for the polymethacrylate polymers, while varying concentrations of IsoPOH were required to desorb proteins from PS, PVC and Chronoflex. There was a correlation between the hydrophobic nature of the material, determined by water contact angle measurements, and adsorption of alpha-1-m. Immunoblotting of isopropanol-eluted proteins by alpha-1-m antibodies showed the positive staining of a 29 kDa protein as well as selected bands within a molecular weight range of 40-200 kDa, suggesting the adsorption of this protein as both free and complexed forms. The ability of alpha-1-m to adsorb on to material surfaces and to participate in events relevant to the biocompatibility of a polymer, such as bacterial infection or inflammation control, suggests the need for further characterization of the properties of this protein.

Unfortunately, biofilm formation on the esophageal side of voice prostheses limits their lifetime to 3-4 mon on average. The effects of repeated argon plasma treatment of medical grade, hydrophobic silicone rubber on in vitro adhesion and growth of bacteria and yeasts isolated from voice prostheses, as well as in vivo biofilm formation are presented here. In vitro experiments demonstrated that initial microbial adhesion over a 4 h time span to plasma-treated, hydrophilized, silicone rubber was generally less than on original, hydrophobic silicone rubber, both in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film on the biomaterial. Growth studies over a time period of 14 d at 37 degrees C in a modified Robbins device, showed that fewer Candida cells adhered on plasma-treated, hydrophilized silicone rubber as compared to on original, hydrophobic silicone rubber. For the in vivo evaluation of biofilm formation on plasma-treated silicone rubber voice prostheses, seven laryngectomized patients received a partly hydrophilized ""Groningen Button"" voice prosthesis for a planned evaluation period of 4 wk. After removal of the voice prostheses, the border between the hydrophilized and the original, hydrophobic side of the prostheses was clearly visible. However, biofilm formation was, unexpectedly, less on the original, hydrophobic sides, although the microbial compositions of the biofilms on both sides were not significantly different. Summarizing, this study demonstrates that in vitro microbial adhesion and growth on silicone rubber can be reduced by plasma treatment, but in vivo biofilm formation on silicone rubber voice prostheses is oppositely enhanced by hydrophilizing the silicone rubber surface. Nevertheless, from the results of this study the important conclusion can be drawn that in vivo biofilm formation on voice prostheses is controlled by the hydrophobicity of the biomaterials surface used.

Biomaterials for implants have to display a wide range adaptability to suit the various stages of the bio-integration process of any foreign material into the human body, Often, a combination of materials is needed. The preparation of a functionally graded bioceramic coating composed of essentially calcium phosphate compounds is explored. The coating is graded in accordance to adhesive strength, bioactivity, and bioresorbability. The bond coat on the Ti-6Al-4V stub is deposited with a particle range of the hydroxyapatite (HA) that will provide a high adhesive strength and bioactivity but have poor bioresorption properties. The top coat, however, is composed of predominantly alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP) that is highly bioresorbable. This arrangement has the propensity of allowing accelerated bio-integration of the coating by the body tissues as the top layer is rapidly resorbed, leaving the more bioactive intermediate layer to facilitate the much needed bioactive properties for proper osteoconduction. The processing steps and problems are highlighted, as well as the results of post-spray heat treatment.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",,,"Khor, Khiam Aik/G-2827-2010; Khor, Khiam Aik (Michael)/B-6929-2009","KHOR, Khiam/0000-0003-1954-8423",,,,33,22,23,0,4,ASM INTERNATIONAL,MATERIALS PARK,"SUBSCRIPTIONS SPECIALIST CUSTOMER SERVICE, MATERIALS PARK, OH 44073-0002 USA",1059-9630,,,J THERM SPRAY TECHN,J.

To quantify the total levels of iron present in this organ, an electrochemical method was chosen based on the application of square wave voltammetry using adsorptive collection of iron-catechol on a mercury film microelectrode (MFM). The optimal working conditions to produce a very stable and reproducible iron peak in the digested kidney samples were found to be pH=7.2 provided by 8.0 mmol/L PIPES buffer, catechol concentration of 3.0x10(4) mol/L, deposition potential -1.80 V and deposition time 20 s. These results were compared with those obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) indicating a good performance of the electrochemical method used. The analytical results show an increase of iron concentration with treatment time, which indicates that this metal ion is partially accumulated in the kidney.

It has formed the basis for the emerging discipline of tissue engineering, which uses principles of molecular developmental biology and morphogenesis gleaned through studies on inductive signals, responding stem cells, and the extracellular matrix to design and construct spare parts that restore function to the human body. Among the many organs in the body, bone has considerable powers for regeneration and is a prototype model for tissue engineering. Implantation of demineralized bone matrix into subcutaneous sites results in local bone induction. This model mimics sequential limb morphogenesis and has permitted the isolation of bone morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), from demineralized adult bone matrix. BMPs initiate, promote, and maintain chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, but are also involved in the morphogenesis of organs other than bone. The symbiosis of the mechanisms underlying bone induction and differentiation is critical for tissue engineering and is governed by both biomechanics (physical forces) and context (microenvironment/extracellular matrix), which can be duplicated by biomimetic biomaterials such as collagens, hydroxyapatite, proteoglycans, and cell adhesion glycoproteins, including fibronectins and laminin. Rules of tissue architecture elucidated in bone morphogenesis may provide insights into tissue engineering and be universally applicable for all organs/tissues, including bones and joints.","Univ Calif Davis, Med Ctr, Ctr Tissue Regenerat & Repair, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Med Ctr, Dept Orthoped Surg, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA","Reddi, AH (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Med Ctr, Ctr Tissue Regenerat & Repair, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.",ahreddi@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,66,590,618,1,78,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1087-0156,1546-1696,,NAT BIOTECHNOL,Nat.

The need to understand the response of human blood to contact with these artificial surfaces has led to multiple studies on the biocompatibilty of biomaterials. Up to this time, these investigations have predominantly been performed using physical, immunological and biochemical methods. Many of these approaches are useful in investigating the multiple factors involved in blood-biomaterial interactions. However, they always reflect the overall behaviour of whole cellular populations in local or systemic reactions. The application of multiparameter flow cytometry, on the other hand, provides insight into antigenic expression and changes at the single-cell level. Therefore, the technique of flow cytometry represents a new and powerful way of analysing and improving the biocompatibility of these materials in blood-contacting applications in this field.

In water, self association is a powerful organizational force leading to a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network (water structure). Localized perturbations in the chemical potential of water as by, for example, contact with a solid surface, induces compensating changes in water structure that can be sensed tens of nanometers from the point of origin using the surface force apparatus (SFA) and ancillary techniques. These instruments reveal attractive or repulsive forces between opposing surfaces immersed in water, over and above that anticipated by continuum theory (DLVO), that are attributed to a variable density (partial molar volume) of a more-or-less ordered water structure, depending on the water wettability (surface energy) of the water-contacting surfaces. Water structure at surfaces is thus found to be a manifestation of hydrophobicity and, while mechanistic/theoretical interpretation of experimental results remain the subject of some debate in the literature, convergence of experimental observations permit, for the first time, quantitative definition of the relative terms 'hydrophobic' and 'hydrophilic'. In particular, long-range attractive forces are detected only between surfaces exhibiting a water contact angle theta > 65 degrees (herein defined as hydrophobic surfaces with pure water adhesion tension tau degrees = gamma degrees cos theta < 30 dyn/cm where gamma degrees is water interfacial tension = 72.8 dyn/cm). Repulsive forces are detected between surfaces exhibiting theta < 65 degrees (hydrophilic surfaces, tau degrees > 30 dyn/cm). These findings suggest at least two distinct kinds of water structure and reactivity: a relatively less-dense water region against hydrophobic surfaces with an open hydrogen-bonded network and a relatively more-dense water region against hydrophilic surfaces with a collapsed hydrogen-bonded network. Importantly, membrane and SFA studies reveal a discrimination between biologically-important ions that preferentially solubilizes divalent ions in more-dense water regions relative to less-dense water regions in which monovalent ions are enriched. Thus, the compelling conclusion to be drawn from the collective scientific evidence gleaned from over a century of experimental and theoretical investigation is that solvent properties of water within the interphase separating a solid surface from bulk water solution vary with contacting surface chemistry. This interphase can extend tens of nanometers from a water-contacting surface due to a propagation of differences in self association between vicinal water and bulk-phase water. Physicochemical properties of interfacial water profoundly influence the biological response to materials in a surprisingly straightforward manner when key measures of biological activity sensitive to interfacial phenomena are scaled against water adhesion tension tau degrees of contacting surfaces. As examples, hydrophobic surfaces ( tau degrees < 30 dyn/cm) support adsorption of various surfactants and proteins from water because expulsion of solute from solution into the interphase between bulk solid and solution phases is energetically favorable. Adsorption to hydrophobic surfaces is driven by the reduction of interfacial energetics concomitant with replacement of water molecules at the surface by adsorbed solute (surface dehydration). Hydrophilic surfaces ( tau degrees > 30 dyn/cm) do not support adsorption because this mechanism is energetically unfavorable. Protein-adsorbing hydrophobic surfaces an inefficient contact activators of the blood coagulation cascade whereas protein-repellent hydrophilic surfaces are efficient activators of blood coagulation. Mammalian cell attachment is a process distinct from protein adsorption that occurs efficiently to hydrophilic surfaces but inefficiently to hydrophobic surfaces. Thus, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrast in the biological response to materials, often disputed in biomaterials science, is very clear when viewed from the perspective of water structure and reactivity at surfaces, The key measure of water structure and activity important to biomaterial scientists is tau degrees rather than parameters such as Zisman's critical surface tension gamma(c) or 'surface free energy' gamma(s) that are shown not to correlate sensibly with either tau degrees or results from the surface force apparatus.

Under these conditions, all biomaterial particle-containing. foreign-body macrophages differentiated into osteoclastic cells, i.e. tartrate-resistant acid, phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells capable of extensive lacunar bone resorption.

The specific objective of this study was to investigate osteoblast precursor cell responses to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces of different treatments. Since the nature of bone cell responses in vitro is influenced by the properties of HA ceramics, this study was divided into two components: a chemical and crystallographic characterization of the HA ceramics and an in vitro cell culture study. The sintered HA samples were observed to have the highest crystallite size as compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA samples. No differences in the surface roughness and chemical composition were observed among the sintered, calcined, and as-received KA surfaces. In concurrence with the X-ray diffraction, high resolution XPS resolution of Ca 2p also indicated a higher crystallinity on sintered HA samples as compared to the calcined and as-received PIA samples. As indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, increased cell-surface and matrix-associated protein, and 1,25 (OH2) vitamin D-3-stimulated osteocalcin production, a more differentiated osteoblast-like phenotype was observed on the sintered HA surfaces compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA surfaces.

Incorporation was achieved by functionalizing the amine terminus of the peptide with an acrylate moiety, thereby enabling the adhesion peptide to copolymerize rapidly with the PEG diacrylate upon photoinitiation. PEG diacrylate hydrogels derivitized with RGD peptide at surface concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 pmol/cm(2) were studied in vitro for their ability to promote spreading of human foreskin fibroblasts over 24 h. Hydrogels not derivitized with peptides were poor substrates for adhesion, permitting spreading of only 5% of the seeded cells. When immobilized with no spacer arm, both RGD and RDG (inactive control) supported spreading of similar to 50% and similar to 15% of cells at 1 and 0.1 pmol/cm(2) surface concentrations, respectively; lower concentrations did not promote spreading. When a MW 3400 PEG spacer arm was incorporated between the hydrogel and the peptide linkage, incorporation of 1 pmol/cm(2) RGD promoted 70% spreading whereas RDG at the same concentration did not promote spreading. In addition, when cells were seeded in serum-free medium, only RGD peptides incorporated with a spacer arm were able to promote spreading. Thus peptide incorporated into PEG 8000 diacrylate hydrogels without a spacer arm nonspecifically mediated cell spreading whereas incorporation via a MW 3400 PEG spacer arm was required to permit cell spreading to be specifically mediated.

The observation of contrasting results for one material using the above-mentioned methods raised some concern about the assay system used. With further experimentation, it appeared that a sustained release of volatile substances still present in one extract exerted a toxic effect in neighboring cultures. It is concluded that in the microenvironment of a microplate the distribution of samples cannot be disregarded, as it may be responsible for toxicity cross-contamination, Moreover, the use of more than one single method has to be recommended in cytotoxicity testing, in order to avoid false positive results due to experimental artifacts.

When they are implanted inside a body, metallic biomaterials may corrode and/or wear, releasing metal ions and debris which may have toxic effects on tissues and organs. Since it is important for biomaterials to have no toxicity against a living body, a systematic and quantitative evaluation of the cytotoxicity of metallic elements is required for the development of new metallic biomaterials with superior biocompatibility. In this study, the cytotoxicity of 43 metal salts were evaluated by the colony formation method using two kinds of cultured cells. The effects of the difference in valence numbers of metallic elements in the salts on cytotoxicity were examined. The cytotoxicity of the salts of metallic elements' oxo acids was also investigated. As a result, the intensity of metal salts' cytotoxicity tends to be quite similar between MC3T3-E1 and L929 (the correlation coefficient of metal salts' IC(50)s is 0.82). The intensity of metal salts' cytotoxicity depends on the kinds of metallic elements, their chemical states, and concentrations. The IC50 of the highest toxic salt is 1.36 x 10(-6) mol L-1, which differs four orders of magnitude from the IC50 of the lowest toxic salt.

The necessary anticoagulation may be contraindicated and may even further increase the risk for the patient. This article evaluates the currently applied polymeric materials used in intensive care units (ICU) and gives a possible outlook into future developments. It is emphasized that systematic interdisciplinary research of physicans and biomaterial scientists is essential for the successful development of new polymers with improved biocompatibility. For this purpose a brief overview of analytical techniques for surface characterization is given, and future developments to a fully biocompatible polymer are described.","Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Klinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Klin Anasthesie & Intens Therapie, Dept Anaesthesiol & Intens Care Med, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Inst Polymer Res Dresden, Dresden, Germany","Ragaller, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Klinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Klin Anasthesie & Intens Therapie, Dept Anaesthesiol & Intens Care Med, Fetscherstasse 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",,"Umlauf, Ursula/D-3356-2014; Werner, Carsten/F-8127-2010","Werner, Carsten/0000-0003-0189-3448",,,,69,0,0,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0085-2538,1523-1755,,KIDNEY INT,Kidney Int.,FEB,1998.0,,,,64,,,S84,S90,,,,,,7,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,YV782,WOS:000071862800020,9475497.0,,,,2019-02-25

The aim of the presented study was to analyse, whether the use of biactive materials (in case of prostheses-hydroxylapatit-coating-) provides advantages concerning the quality of anchorage compared to biotolerant or bionert materials. The influence of grade of biocompatibility of materials, the surface structure, the period of investigation and weightbearing on the osseointegration of implants was evaluated in an animal experimental study. New Zealand White rabbits got implanted cylinders in the non weightbearing series and spacers in the weightbearing series in the distal femur. The implant materials were spongy metal, porous coated titanium and hydroxylapatit coated titanium. After the experimantal period of 4, 8 respectively 12 weeks the implant bearing femur underwent histological, morphometrical and scanning electromicroscopical investigation. The amount of osseointegration was determined by using the automatical image analysis. The percentage of new build bone was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and the adhesive power by push out tests. For non weightbearing implants higher adhesive powers were measured compared to hydroxylapatit coated implants while osseointegration was identic. All primary press-fit anchored weightbearing implants showed osseointegration. In hydroxylapatit coated specimen the most intensive osseointegration was found however without influence on the adhesive power. This fact was caused by the delamination of the plasma coating as consequence of the unsufficient attachment of the hydroxylapatit coat to the metal nucleus.","Sana Klin Zollernalb GMBH, D-72461 Albstadt, Germany","Gondolph-Zink, B (reprint author), Sana Klin Zollernalb GMBH, Robert Koch Str 26, D-72461 Albstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,35,12,12,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0085-4530,,,ORTHOPADE,Orthopade,FEB,1998.0,27,2,,,,,96,104,,,,,,9,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,ZB832,WOS:000072512500007,9530666.0,,,,2019-02-25

When appropriate treatments were applied, immunological, inflammatory, bacteriological or virological adverse responses can be prevented. However, these treatments may interact with type I collagen, the major component of the organic bone matrix. Type I collagen can bind osteoblasts via specific cell surface receptors, the integrins. In this work, two different xenogenic biomaterials were studied. Both biomaterials have a bovine bone origin. They displayed similar architectural organization with connected plates and rods and similar surface topography and roughness. They differed by the presence or not of collagen type I. The first one was characterized by preservation of the type I collagen matrix associated with spindle-shaped hydroxyapatite crystals and the sec end was solely composed by heal-modified apatite crystals. Osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2) were cultured on both biomaterials and examined in scanning and transmission electron microscopy after 7 and 14 days. Both biomaterials were cytocompatible as demonstrated by good ultrastructural cell preservation. (1) At the surface of the collagen containing biomaterial, cells were elongated in shape and oriented according to the trabecular architecture and to the superficial collagen network. After 14 days of culture, cells were confluent and the biomaterial surface was hidden by the cell sheet. The beta 1 integrin subunit was detected by immunogold in transmission electron microscopy in close relationship with the superficial collagen fibres of the biomaterial and with the outer cell surface. When cultures were carried out in presence of anti beta 1 integrin subunit, cells were packed and piled up with lack of specific orientation. (2) At the surface of the deproteinized biomaterial, cells were globular without specific disposition and often partially attached to the surface. After 14 days of culture, large areas of the biomaterial surface remained uncovered. Anti beta 1 subunits conjugated with gold particles were detected around the cells but with no specific association with the deproteinized biomaterial. These: results strongly suggest that presence of type I collagen fibres in the matrix of a bone biomaterial is of major interest to determine cell attachment, spreading and orientation via interaction between type I collagen and beta 1 integrin subunit of osteoblasts.","Fac Med, Lab Histol Embryol, LHEA, F-49045 Angers, France","Basle, MF (reprint author), Fac Med, Lab Histol Embryol, LHEA, F-49045 Angers, France.",,,,,,,30,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0085-4530,,,ORTHOPADE,Orthopade,FEB,1998.0,27,2,,,,,136,142,,,,,,7,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,ZB832,WOS:000072512500011,9530670.0,,,,2019-02-25

The results obtained contribute significantly to the understanding of the basic mechanisms of adsorption and surface dynamics of organic molecules. especially of proteins. An example of an area of great importance is biomaterials, where ellipsometry is used as a tool in the process of acquiring knowledge about the biological acceptance of new as well as currently used implant materials. In the area of affinity biosensors, ellipsometry has been suggested as a potential readout principle. Ellipsometry is also a tool in emerging technologies, such as surface molecular engineering with the aim to construct molecular superstructures with predesigned biological functions and to interface biology with electronics. However, in most cases when ellipsometry is applied in biology, it has been used for surface mass determination. The potential in using spectroscopic data for reasoning microstructural and dynamic information has not been exploited fully. From the above perspective, this report reviews the use of spectroscopic ellipsometry for studies in surface biology and highlights the advantages it offers. Two main themes are developed. The first is spectroscopy on monolayers of macromolecules with emphasis on determination of their dielectric functions and microstructure. A specific example discussed is ferritin adsorption on gold. The results, including dynamics of both the surface mass and layer microstructure, indicate an adsorption model based on a two-state adsorption mechanism. The second theme is ellipsometrically based biosensor systems. The discussion covers aspects of what imaging ellipsometry can provide in this content and is exemplified by results from affinity biosensor and gas sensor systems.

The goal of the study was to search for a critical size defect model leading to nonunion. The bone gap was maintained for three months with an internal fixation device involving two plates set in orthogonal planes. Radiological and histological examinations were performed on harvested metatarsal banes. Three months after surgery Group #1 animals showed obvious signs of bone healing without achieving complete union in all cases. Evidence of a healing process was not observed in Group #2 animals, and histological examination confirmed the complete failure of bone repair in the 20 mm gaps. These results are comparable to those of other authors who have concluded that a bone gap corresponding to 1.4 times the diaphyseal diameter overshoots physiological bone healing capacities. This long bone defect model showed good biological properties allowing callus settlement with minimal impairment in Group #1 and permitted weightbearing and unrestricted motion in the animals.

A triphasic composite, fabricated by the heterogeneous sintering of titanium and graphite powders was developed to address the fracture and wear performance of titanium. The composite is designed to smear graphite on both articulating surfaces and hence reduced wear and maintained a low friction tribosystem with fracture properties better than conventional bioceramics. The composite is made up of ductile titanium and a colony of hard, wear resistant titanium carbide produced by the controlled sintering of titanium and graphite particles. Free graphite is present in varying quantities depending upon compaction pressure and initial graphite composition. Initial graphite content composites of 4% and 8% were made with different compaction pressure to give a range of porosities from 10% to 45%. The coefficient of frictional was measured on a pin-on-disc (hardened steel) configuration. Under dry state, the coefficient of friction was observed to reduce with increasing porosity. Graphite smearing and the entrapment of debris by the pores contributed to the reduction of the wear components which in rum reduced the coefficient of friction. Under lubricated conditions, the sintered titanium and its composites were observed to be independent of porosity and pore size. The frictional behaviour of the titanium-8% graphite composites showed first, a titanium carbide dominated-wear stage and the second, a free graphite smearing stage. The results proved the concept that the coefficient of friction of titanium-graphite composites approaches that between graphite-graphite surfaces after the running-in period. This proof of concept is the first realisation of a biomaterial that could reduce the coefficient of friction on both articulating surfaces, a step closer to the development of fracture and wear resistant biomaterials that also protects the other counter surface.

Over time, laboratory wear tests have been developed and used more frequently to support the introduction of new material couples. Historically, these methods have been unreliable, and, despite recent improvements, predicting clinical wear performance is still a challenging task. Orthopaedic wear is a highly multi-factorial process-successful simulation depends on the identification, modeling, and control of many critical factors. Clinical results themselves an highly variable, complicating efforts to establish clinical validation criteria for test methods. It is recommended that improvements be made in identifying the appropriate clinical targets for laboratory tests, and that increased effort be directed toward the optimization and standardization of wear test methods.","Smith & Nephew Inc, Orthopaed Div, Memphis, TN 38116 USA","Sauer, WL (reprint author), Smith & Nephew Inc, Orthopaed Div, 1450 Brooks Rd, Memphis, TN 38116 USA.",,,,,,,167,30,30,0,3,AMER SOCIETY TESTING AND MATERIALS,W CONSHOHOCKEN,"100 BARR HARBOR DRIVE, W CONSHOHOCKEN, PA 19428-2959 USA",0066-0558,,0-8031-2490-2,AM SOC TEST MATER,,,1998.0,1346,,,,,,1,29,,10.1520/STP12827S,,,,29,"Engineering, Biomedical; Orthopedics",Engineering; Orthopedics,BM49Q,WOS:000078897100001,,,,,2019-02-25

Materials and Methods: Cylindrical Class V cavities were prepared in human premolars. In the non-exposure group an attempt was made to prepare the floor of the cavity to +/- 0.5 mm from the pulp. In the exposure group, the pulps were intentionally exposed. After hemostasis, the preparation was etched with 10% phosphoric acid. The teeth were restored with All-Bond 2. Histological evaluation was done at 0-7, 28-35, and >90 days. Results: A typical connective tissue response to injury was observed in the majority of the specimens. Irreversible injury to the odontoblasts closest to the site of cavity preparations resulted in the death of these cells. This was followed by an early neutrophilic response, a subsequent macrophage response and a fibroblastic response that led to the deposition of either reparative dentin or calcific bridge formation by odontoblast-like cells. However, another notable feature was the consistent observation of resin particulates within the dentin-pulp complex. These resin particulates could have been indirectly introduced into the pulp through the pertubation of the junctional complexes or the death of the odontoblasts. They may also enter the pulp directly through a pulpal exposure. In some specimens, the presence of these resin particulates appeared to have triggered a foreign body response, characterized by the presence of a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate as well as the appearance of multinuclear giant cells. The persistence of unresolved chronic inflammation was associated with the lack of calcific bridge formation in these specimens.","Univ Hong Kong, Prince Philip Dent Hosp, Dept Childrens Dent & Orthodont, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Biol & Pathol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Tay, FR (reprint author), Univ Hong Kong, Prince Philip Dent Hosp, Dept Childrens Dent & Orthodont, 34 Hosp Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,76,53,53,0,1,"MOSHER & LINDER, INC",WESTON,"318 INDIAN TRACE SUITE 500, WESTON, FL 33326 USA",0894-8275,,,AM J DENT,Am.

Several biomaterials have been tested as a matrix for the ingrowth of (peri)chondroblasts in experimental animals. In young (growing) rabbits we have developed a process of heterotopic cartilage induction with the use of a demineralized (bovine) bone matrix which is enfolded in a pedicled flap of ear perichondrium for at least three weeks. During this period the demineralized matrix is colonized by macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells which start a process of complete biodegradation of the material. Simultaneously, the collagen matrix is invaded by mesenchymal cells, originating from the perichondrium and differentiating into chondroblasts and Inter, into chondrocytes forming the intel cellular substance. The developing, very young cartilage could be demonstrated as collagen type II, thus, hyaline cartilage. When applied with its adherent perichondrium as a graft it merges easily with the more matured host cartilage and even appears to be capable of further growth. Therefore, it seems suitable for the reconstruction of a cartilaginous defect in growing cartilaginous structures like the nasal septum or the larynx.","Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, NL-3015 GD Rotterdam, Netherlands","Verwoerd-Verhoef, HL (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Dr Molewaterplein 40, NL-3015 GD Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,12,9,11,0,0,OCEAN SIDE PUBLICATIONS INC,PROVIDENCE,"95 PITMAN ST, PROVIDENCE, RI 02906 USA",1050-6586,,,AM J RHINOL,Am.

The common denominator for the three main elements that play a role in the physiopathlology of such infections (bacteria, neutrophils, and different biomaterials) are host proteins deposited over the surface of the devices immediately after their implantation. These proteins modulate that host cells response but can also promote Staphylococcus adhesion to the biomaterial. Neutrophils and other cells such as fibroblasts adhere to several extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, vitronectin, via specific cell surface receptor.

A common feature in their biochemistry is that they accumulate large amounts of disaccharides, the most common of which are sucrose and trehalose. Over the past 20 years, we have provided evidence that these sugars stabilize membranes and proteins in the dry state, most likely by hydrogen bonding to polar residues in the dry macromolecular assemblages. This direct interaction results in maintenance of dry proteins and membranes in a physical state similar to that seen in the presence of excess water. An alternative viewpoint has been proposed, based on the fact that both sucrose and trehalose form glasses in the dry state. It has been suggested that glass formation (vitrification) is in itself sufficient to stabilize dry biomaterials. In this review we present evidence that, although vitrification is indeed required, it is not in itself sufficient. Instead, both direct interaction and vitrification are required. Special properties have often been claimed for trehalose in this regard. In fact, trehalose has been shown by many workers to be remarkably (and sometimes uniquely) effective in stabilizing dry or frozen biomolecules, cells, and tissues. Others have not observed any such special properties. We review evidence here showing that trehalose has a remarkably high glass-transition temperature (T-g). It is not anomalous in this regard because it lies at the end of a continuum of sugars with increasing T-g, However, it is unusual in that addition of small amounts of water does not depress T-g, as in other sugars. Instead, a dihydrate crystal of trehalose forms, thereby shielding the remaining glassy trehalose from effects of the added water. Thus under less than ideal conditions such as high humidity and temperature, trehalose does indeed have special properties, which may explain the stability and longevity of anhydrobiotes that contain it. Further, it makes this sugar useful in stabilization of biomolecules of use in human welfare.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Denver, CO 80262 USA","Crowe, JH (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jhcrowe@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,85,860,896,2,137,ANNUAL REVIEWS INC,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4278,,,ANNU REV PHYSIOL,Annu.

Nitrogen ions of 500 eV/at. were used to bombard the surface of polycarbonate (PC) samples to a fluence of 5x10(16) at/cm(2). Five different environments (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, dry air and vacuum) were used to store the samples for some hours (1 to 24 hours) after the implantation. Aging studies of the contact angle (advancing and receding) have shown that the environment gas influences the long term value of the contact angle and helps to maintain the stability of the treated surfaces with the passage of time. XPS and ToF-SIMS have been used to study the chemical effects of both N-2(+) ion irradiation and storage gas surrounding the samples. The results show faster aging in the case of the samples stored in vacuum, a harmful effect of nitrogen gas on the treatment and the formation of new chemical species for all treatments.","Univ Quebec, INRS Energie & Mat, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S2, Canada","Poirier, A (reprint author), Univ Quebec, INRS Energie & Mat, 1650 Blvd Lionel Boulet, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S2, Canada.",ross@inrs-ener.uquebec.ca,,,,,,11,2,2,0,2,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-409-2,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,1998.0,504,,,,,,425,430,,,,,,6,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Coatings & Films",Materials Science,BM67L,WOS:000079427800064,,,,,2019-02-25

The polyrotaxanes inhibited cytoplasmic calcium increase in platelets, increased plasma membrane fluidity of red blood cell ghosts, and elevated cytoplasmic cyclic-3',5'-AMP levels in platelets. Such cellular response to the polyrotaxanes was observed, which was more than that to constituent molecules. These results suggest that the supramolecular structure of the polyrotaxanes contributes to acceleration of the physicochemical interaction with plasma membrane and intracellular metabolism of platelets.

Regioselective acylation of beta-O-methyl-galactopyranoside in nearly anhydrous pyridine with lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia yields the 6-acryloyl derivative (Compound I). Further lipase-catalysed acylation of the monoacrylate derivative in nearly anhydrous acetone yielded 2,6-diacryloyl-beta-O-methyl galactopyranoside (Compound II) that can act as a cross-linker with a structure similar to that of the sugar-based monomer. The high selectivity of enzyme catalysis yielded apparently highly regular hydrogel networks with swelling ratios at equilibrium ranging from 170 to 1100, elastic moduli ranging from 0.005 to 0.088 MPa and calculated mesh sizes ranging from 1160 to 6600 Angstrom. These values are far higher than conventional uncharged or lightly charged hydrogels at similar elastic moduli. Gel swelling was fast, with 75% of the equilibrium swelling value reached in a fractional time of 0.17. Non-selective chemical acryloylation of beta-O-methyl galactopyranoside followed by polymerization yielded a far lower-swelling hydrogel than that obtained using selective enzyme catalysis. These results indicate that the highly regular polymer structure achieved by regioselective enzyme-catalysed acylation yields relatively strong and highly swellable materials. Sugar-based hydrogels, such as those described herein, may find particular use as biomaterials because of their high water content, homogeneity, stability and expected non-toxicity. A wide range of pore sizes can be attained, suggesting that they may also be especially useful as matrices for enzyme immobilization and controlled delivery of biological macromolecules.

Poly[trimellitylimido-L-tyrosine-co-sebacic acid-co-1,3-bis(carboxyphenoxy)propane] microspheres, with and without entrapped bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, were made using the double emulsion solvent evaporation process. Water penetration and anhydride bond cleavage (polymer degradation) occurred rapidly (<5 days) compared to the time scale of overall microsphere erosion (weeks to months) with most polymer compositions. Subsequent to bond cleavage, the ultimate erosion of the microsphere and release of entrapped BSA was due mainly to the slow dissolution of the individual hydrophobic monomers (TMA-Tyr, SA and CPP) from the microsphere surface. BSA. was released at approximately the same rate as the polymer eroded. Due to the fast degradation of anhydride bonds relative to microsphere erosion, initial polymer molecular weight did not have a significant effect on macromolecule release rates. Instead, monomer solubility correlated well with polymer erosion and BSA release rates. This erosion mechanism leads to predictable drug release rates which may be appropriate for the delivery of many protein therapeutics, including vaccine antigens. The anhydride-imide copolymers were well tolerated in acute toxicity studies in rats and therefore show promise as biomaterials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This work was directed towards the investigation of model systems and clinically-applicable materials which provide both of these surface requirements. Model systems were prepared by chemically grafting end-functionalized star poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to surfaces. The end-grafted polymers provide a means for cell-signaling through coupling of peptides to the free chain ends. Protein adsorption on star vs. linear grafted layers was compared. To further understand these results, neutron reflectivity studies were carried out in situ for solvated PEO surfaces to determine the concentration profiles of the swollen grafted layers. Surprisingly, grafted PEO layers which resist protein adsorption have low concentrations of polymer segments throughout the swollen layer. We find that dense star architectures which might be expected to impart improved protein resistance in fact allow small proteins to adsorb. For clinical materials, a novel approach to the surface modification of poly(lactide) (PLA) has been taken by surface segregating a comb copolymer containing a PLA backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) teeth. The ends of the teeth provide sites for surface tethering of peptide ligands. Comb surfaces without tethered ligands are cell adhesion resistant, indicating strong protein adsorption resistance. By then incorporating an adhesion ligand, modulation of cell morphology on comb surfaces has been demonstrated. Finally, the surface segregation of the comb to the surface of PLA was shown via cell attachment assays and XPS measurements.","MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Mayes, AM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,0,9,9,0,1,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-436-X,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,1998.0,530,,,,,,73,84,,10.1557/PROC-530-73,,,,12,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Materials Science,BL98P,WOS:000077368400012,,,,,2019-02-25

First and foremost, materials themselves tend to be hydrophobic and/or thrombogenic in nature, and face compatibility problems upon implantation. To mediate this problem, researchers have attempted to graft proteins or protein fragments onto biomaterial surfaces to promote endothelial cell attachment and minimize thrombosis. We envisioned a novel approach, based on the capability of biomolecules to self-assemble into well-defined and intricate structures, for creating biomimetic biomaterials that promote cell adhesion and proliferation. One of the most intriguing self-assembly processes is the folding of peptide chains into native protein structures. We have developed a method for building proteinlike structural motifs that incorporate sequences of biological interest. A lipophilic moiety is attached onto an N-alpha-amino group of a peptide chain, resulting in a ""peptide-amphiphile."" The alignment of amphiphilic compounds at the lipid-solvent interface is used to facilitate peptide alignment and structure initiation and propagation, while the lipophilic region adsorbs to hydrophobic surfaces. Peptide-amphiphiles containing potentially triple-helical or alpha-helical structural motifs have been synthesized. The resultant head group structures have been characterized by CD spectroscopy and found to be thermally stable over physiological temperature ranges. Triple-helical peptide-amphiphiles have been applied to studies of surface modification and cell receptor binding. Cell adhesion and spreading was promoted by triple-helical peptide-amphiphiles. Cellular interaction with the type IV collagen sequence alpha 1(IV) 1263-1277 increased signal transduction, with both the time mid level of induction dependent upon triple-helical conformation. Collectively, these results suggest that peptide-amphiphiles may be used to form stable molecular structures on biomaterial surfaces that promote cellular activities and improve biocompatibility.

Cell biologists, engineers, and surgeons now work within a team. Artificial connective, epithelial, or neuronal tissues are being constructed using living cells and different kinds of biomaterials. Numerous companies and laboratories are presenting dynamic developments in this field. Prognoses predict that, at the beginning of the coming century, the industry of tissue engineering will reach the importance of the present genetic technology. An enormous demand for organ and tissue transplants motivates research activities and drives the acquisition of innovative techniques and creative solutions. At the front of this development is the creation of artificial skin for severely burned patients and the generation of artificial cartilage for implantation in articular joint diseases. Future challenges are the construction of liver organoids and the development of an artificial kidney on the basis of cultured cells. In this paper we show strategies, needs, tools, and equipment for tissue engineering. The presupposition for all projects is the induction, development, and maintenance of differentiation within the tissue under in vitro conditions. As experiments in conventional culture dishes continued to fail, new cell and tissue culture methods had to be developed. Tissues are cultured under conditions as close as possible to their natural environment. To optimize adherence or embedding, cells are grown on novel tissue carriers and on individually selected biomatrices or scaffolds. The tissues are subsequently transferred into different types of containers for permanent perfusion with fresh culture medium. This guarantees constant nutrition of the developing tissue and prevents the accumulation of harmful metabolites. An or gano-typical environment for epithelial cells, for example, is obtained in gradient containers, which are permanently superfused at the apical and basal sides with different media. Long term experiments result in cultured tissues in a quality thus far unreached.","Univ Regensburg, Inst Anat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; Humboldt Univ, German Rheumatism Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Dept Med 3, Berlin, Germany","Minuth, WW (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Anat, Univ St 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",will.minuth@vkl.uni-regensburg.de,,,,,,102,127,136,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0302-766X,1432-0878,,CELL TISSUE RES,Cell Tissue Res.,JAN,1998.0,291,1,,,,,1,11,,,,,,11,Cell Biology,Cell Biology,YN154,WOS:000071138500001,9394038.0,,,,2019-02-25

Generally, interactions between proteins and polysaccharides in aqueous media can lead to one- or two-phase systems, the latter being generally observed. In some cases of protein-polysaccharide net attraction, mainly mediated through electrostatic interactions, complex coacervation or associative phase separation occurs, giving rise to the formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes. Physicochemical factors such as pH, ionic strength, ratio of protein to polysaccharide, polysaccharide and protein charge, and molecular weight affect the formation and stability of such complexes. Additionally, the temperature and mechanical factors (pressure, shearing rate, and time) have an influence on phase separation and time stability of the system. The protein-polysacchaide complexes exhibit better functional properties than that of the proteins and polysaccharides alone. This improvement could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of the two biopolymers, as well as the structure of the complexes. Consequently, the interesting hydration (solubility, viscosity), structuration (aggregation, gelation) and surface (foaming, emulsifying) properties of these complexes can be used in a number of domains. Among others, these could be macromolecular purification, microencapsulation, food formulation (fat replacers, texturing agents), and synthesis of biomaterials (edible films, artificial grafts).","Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Ecole Natl Agron & Ind Alimentairs, Lab Physicochim & Genie Alimentaires, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Sanchez, C (reprint author), Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Ecole Natl Agron & Ind Alimentairs, Lab Physicochim & Genie Alimentaires, 2 Ave Foret Haye,BP 172, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",,,,,,,243,511,529,23,371,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1040-8398,1549-7852,,CRIT REV FOOD SCI,Crit.

In this paper, we compare the relative performance of these three ionization methods for characterizing the molecular weights, polydispersities and quantification of relative amounts of polymer components in mixtures, Two polymers used in biomaterials, poly(dimethylsiloxane) and poly(ethylene glycol), are employed as the model polymer systems for our survey because of their well defined molecular weights and importance as surfactants in biomaterials and because many of their surface and solution-phase properties are well understood. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization can be used to examine the surface and bulk composition of biomaterials, whereas secondary ion mass spectrometry is used for examining monolayer and submonolayer coverage of polymers on surfaces and electrospray ionization is suited for examination of extractables from biomaterials, Secondary ion mass spectrometry and electrospray show discriminate behavior against ionization of higher molecular weight oligomers, especially of poly(dimethylsiloxane). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization appears to exhibit the best performance for reliable molecular weight determination at higher masses and polydispersity characterization as well as for quantification of components in polymer mixtures. The results are discussed within the context of the ionization mechanisms by which each soft ionization technique operates and by the attributes of the mass analyzers (time-of-flight and Fourier transform mass spectrometers) employed.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Chem, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; Bausch & Lomb Inc, Rochester, NY 14692 USA; Roswell Pk Canc Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Biophys, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA","Yan, WY (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Chem, Nat Sci Complex, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,,"Wood, Troy/0000-0002-2556-8511",,,,25,22,22,0,14,IM PUBLICATIONS,W SUSSEX,"6 CHARLTON MILL, CHARLTON, CHICHESTER,, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO18 0HY",1356-1049,,,EUR MASS SPECTROM,Eur.

Collagenous biomaterials can be stabilized by chemical and physical agents. The epithelium of enucleated porcine eyes was removed. Eight test groups, 10 eyes each, were treated with UV-light (lambda = 254 nm), 0.5% riboflavin, 0.5% riboflavin and W-light (365 nm) blue light (436 nm) and sunlight, and the chemical agents-glutaraldehyde (1% and 0.1%, 10 min) and Karnovsky's solution (0.1%, 10 min). Strips of 5 mm in width and 9 mm in length were cut from each cornea and the stress-strain behaviour of the strips was measured to assess the cross-linking process. For comparison, ten untreated corneas were measured by the same method. Compared to untreated corneas treatment with riboflavin and UV-irradiation as well as weak glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky's solutions resulted in an increased stiffness of the cornea. The biomechanical behaviour of the cornea can be altered by glutaraldehyde, Karnovsky's solution, and with riboflavin and UV-irradiation which offers the potential of a conservative treatment of keratoconus. To optimize this effect further investigation is necessary regarding the dose-response and in-vivo application.

Human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured with ascorbic acid produced a cohesive cellular sheet. This sheet was placed around a tubular support to produce the media of the vessel. A similar sheet of human fibroblasts was wrapped around the media to provide the adventitia. After maturation, the tubular support was removed and endothelial cells were seeded in the lumen. This TEBV featured a well-defined, three-layered organization and numerous extracellular matrix proteins, including elastin. In this environment, SMC reexpressed desmin, a differentiation marker known to be lost under standard culture conditions. The endothelium expressed von Willebrand factor, incorporated acetylated LDL, produced PGI(2), and strongly inhibited platelet adhesion in vitro. The complete vessel had a burst strength over 2000 mmHg. This is the first completely biological TEBV to display a burst strength comparable to that of human vessels. Short-term grafting experiment in a canine model demonstrated good handling and suturability characteristics. Taken together, these results suggest that this novel technique can produce completely biological vessels fulfilling the fundamental requirements for grafting: high burst strength, positive surgical handling, and a functional endothelium.","Hop St Sacrement, Lab Angiogenese Expt LOEX, Ste Foy, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada; Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada","Auger, FA (reprint author), Hop St Sacrement, Lab Angiogenese Expt LOEX, 1050 Chemin, Ste Foy, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada.",nheureux@bioeng.ucsd.edu; lucie.germain@chg.ulaval.ca,,,,,,67,879,892,9,196,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,JAN,1998.0,12,1,,,,,47,56,,,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,YR723,WOS:000071523800006,9438410.0,,,,2019-02-25

For TP35H and SUS329J4L, the crack growth characteristics in Ringer's solution were almost the same as those in room air in the entire Delta K region examined, and thus the effect of Ringer's solution was not observed. The crack growth rates of SUS304 were enhanced in Ringer's solution in the region of Delta K greater than or equal to 25 MPa root m as compared ro room air, while below this Delta K level they were similar in both environments. Also in Ti-6Al-4V, similar crack growth behaviour in Ringer's solution was found. From the comparison among the da/dN-Delta K relationships of the four materials in Ringer's solution, TP35H exhibited the fastest growth rates and then Ti-6Al-4V, SUS304, SUS329J4L in the order of decreasing growth rate. On the contrary, if the data were plotted in terms of Delta K-eff/E, Ti-6Al-4V and TP35H showed superior crack growth resistance to the stainless steels.","Toyota Coll Technol, Dept Engn Mech, Toyota, Japan; Toyohashi Univ Technol, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan; Gifu Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Gifu, Japan","Nakajima, M (reprint author), Toyota Coll Technol, Dept Engn Mech, 2-1 Eisei Cho, Toyota, Japan.",,,,,,,21,12,12,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",8756-758X,,,FATIGUE FRACT ENG M,Fatigue Fract.

The simulator was also used to evaluate the wear and damage of various material combinations, the effect of conformity, lubricant type, and material integrity. The level of sophistication relating to each type of simulation device is reflected in the development costs of each simulator. For merely material ranking tests the simple pin-on-disc machines represent a quick and low cost estimate of relative material performance. However, for a more accurate representation of the in vivo performance of prosthetic knee replacements it is necessary to replicate the complex kinematics by means of electro-hydraulic or electro-pneumatic simulators with superimposed variable loading patterns. The simulation device detailed in this paper offers some level of performance prediction with respect to the material combinations used for total knee replacements and the laboratory simulation results compare favourably with clinical retrievals. The paper concludes that true simulation is difficult because of the complexity of the systems involved. However, comparative results for both different designs and different biomaterials can be reasonably estimated if there is a goad analogue of both the duty cycle and the predominant in vitro conditions. From the work carried out it appears that important factors for this type of simulation are the integrity of the UHMWPE, lubricant type, surface conformity, and the inclusion of superimposed twisting.","Kingston Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Surrey, England","Lilley, PA (reprint author), Kingston Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,INST ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS INSPEC INC,EDISON,"379 THORNALL ST, EDISON, NJ 08837 USA",0537-9989,,0-85296-709-8,IEE CONF PUBL,,,1998.0,,457,,,,,35,41,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Transportation",Engineering; Transportation,BM06G,WOS:000077496200006,,,,,2019-02-25

Specifically, we will concentrate on the methodology developed by van Oss, Chaudhury and Good [5-7] for the determination of the work of adhesion and interfacial tension. Recently, Good [4] has redefined the surface interaction components gamma(+) and gamma(-) as hydrogen bond acidic and basic parameters. We have related the surface-hydrogen-bond components gamma(+) and gamma(-) to the Taft and Kamlet's [28,29] linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) solvatochromic alpha and beta parameters. We [28,29] have found that, for water at ambient temperature, alpha hydrogen-bond-donating (HBD) ability] and beta[ [hydrogen-bond-accepting (HBA) ability] are not equal, and the ratio for the normalized alpha and beta is 1.8. This new ratio is assumed to be equal to that of gamma(+) & gamma(-) for water at 20 degrees C. On the basis of the new ratio, we will present our recalculated surface-hydrogen-bond components for several polymers and biomaterials. This change in the ratio did not affect the total surface tension or the sign of the interfacial tension. The net improvement is in the lowering of the gamma(-) values. These data may be useful for predicting the adhesion between an adhesive and an adherend.","Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Lee, LH (reprint author), 796 John Glenn Blvd, Webster, NY 14580 USA.",,,,,,,45,17,17,0,7,GORDON BREACH SCI PUBL LTD,READING,"C/O STBS LTD, PO BOX 90, READING RG1 8JL, BERKS, ENGLAND",0021-8464,,,J ADHESION,J.

The chain extender was synthesized by a diesterification reaction between L-phenylalanine and 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol to yield a diester, diamine. Soft segment chemistry (polycaprolactone diol, PCL and polyethylene oxide, PEO) and molecular weight were varied and the impact on polyurethane physicochemical and degradation characteristics was evaluated. It was found that the PEO containing polyurethanes absorbed large amounts of water while the PCL containing ones did not, indicating a large difference in bulk hydrophilicity. The rate of water vapor permeance (WVP) through the polyurethane films generally followed the water absorption trends. However, soft segment crystallinity, noted by DSC, for the PCL containing polyurethanes served to reduce WVP values with increasing PCL molecular weight. Polyurethane surface characterization was carried out by water contact angles and XPS. The PEO containing polyurethanes exhibited low contact angles in comparison with the PCL ones. In addition, angle-resolved XPS demonstrated soft segment surface enrichment in all cases typical for phase segregated materials. Significant variation in the physicochemical properties of the experimental polyurethanes was observed indicating potential use in a variety of biomaterials applications. An in vitro degradation study was carried out by incubating the polymers in 0.1 M TBS at 37 degrees C, pH 8.0 for up to 56 days. Degradation was followed by measuring mass loss, change in molecular weight by GPC and surface alteration by scanning electron microscopy. The polyurethane containing PEO was found to exhibit substantial mass and molecular weight loss over 56 days resulting in a porous material of little strength. In contrast, the PCL containing polyurethane displayed modest mass and molecular weight loss after 56 days. This polyurethane retained its strength and displayed little surface alteration after 56 days in buffer. It was hypothesized that differences in polyurethane hydrophilicity as well as initial molecular weight may have been responsible for the dramatic difference in degradation rate observed here.","Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada","Woodhouse, KA (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, 200 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada.",,,,,,,39,124,126,6,53,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) showed defluorination, oxygen incorporation, and extensive unsaturation within the treated PTFE surfaces. The suitability of these reduced PTFE films as substrates for graft polymerization was initially assessed via photograft polymerization of the sodium salt of styrenesulfonic acid (SS-Na), which permitted unequivocal surface analysis by the introduction of a new atom, as well as poly(ethylene glycol) monoacrylate (PEG-Ac). All photograft polymerization was performed employing ultraviolet irradiation with 2,2 -dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as an initiator. Photograft polymerization of SS-Na was verified by further reduction of fluorine atomic content and the appearance of new sulfur and sodium atomic peaks on ESCA survey spectra, and that of PEG-Ac was verified by further reduction of fluorine atomic content and increase of atomic percent ratio of O/C from ESCA survey spectra as well as appearance of a new ester peak on high resolution ESCA C 1s spectra. Dynamic water contact angles on reduced and PEG-Ac photograft polymerized films were measured and showed that the PTFE film surface became more hydrophilic after reduction (from 120 to 89 deg) and the reduced film became more hydrophilic after photograft polymerization with PEG-Ac (from 89 to 36 deg). Modification of the complete surface of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), i.e, of the lumenal, outside and pore surfaces, was performed by employing the reaction described above, except at 105 degrees C for 1 day, followed by photograft polymerization of PEG-Ac. ESCA was performed on the superficial surfaces (i.e. the lumen and exterior) as well as on cross-sections of the ePTFE to permit analysis of the pore surfaces. This analysis showed that both the initial surface reduction and the subsequent photograft polymerization were successful as indicated from F/C and O/C atomic percent ratios from ESCA survey spectra, from overall peak shapes of high resolution ESCA C Is spectra and from generation of new ester peaks on high resolution ESCA C Is spectra of ePTFE graft polymerized with PEG-Ac, which demonstrated an O/C atomic percent ratio close to that of PEG-Ac homopolymer. Low voltage scanning electron microscopy confirmed minimal morphological damage to the ePTFE microstructure after reduction and graft polymerization. The approach explored thus provides a means for modulation of biological interactions at ePTFE surfaces with only minimal modification of material morphology, with some surface texture appearing on a length scale of 50-100 nm.","Univ Texas, Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Ctr Biomed, Farmington, CT 06030 USA","Hubbell, JA (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, Moussonstr 18, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland.",hubbell@biomed.mat.ethz.ch,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",NIGMS NIH HHS [R43 GM064291]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR-570]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R29 HL055450],,,39,21,21,0,8,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Poly(AM-co-VA) film was synthesized by Hofmann degradation of a cross-linked poly(acrylamide) film. Conversion to vinyl amine on the surface of the film was approximately 50%, but bulk conversion was not observed; surface specificity was thought to be the result of cleavage of aminated polymer chains at the surface due to chain scission. Reaction between primary amine and TPEG gave a graft yield of 2 mol% (based on XPS) with respect to available surface amine groups, equivalent to 54 mol% ethylene oxide based on monomer units. Physical adsorption of non-activated polymer was done under identical conditions as a control and the difference in oxygen content was significant compared to TPEG. The type of buffer agent and buffer concentration did not influence graft yields. This graft reaction, which was completed in as little as 2 h was considered to be mild enough to be used for a surface modification of microcapsules containing cells without affecting their viability. Such a surface modification technique may prove to be a useful means of enhancing the biocompatibility of microcapsules (or any tissue engineering construct) even after cell encapsulation or seeding.","Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada; Univ Toronto, Ctr Biomat, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada","Sefton, MV (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada.",,,,,,,22,2,3,0,14,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Analysis by ATR-FTIR and ESCA reveled that PEG was incorporated well within the GL9-PEG polymer networks and was enriched at the surfaces. From the results of SEM, AFM, and contact angle analyses, GL9-PEG networks showed relatively rough and irregular surfaces compared to GL9 network, but the mobile PEG chains coupled at their termini were readily exposed toward the aqueous environment when contacting water such that the surfaces became smoother and more hydrophilic. This reorientation and increase in hydrophilicity were more extensive with increasing PEG molecular weight and content. As compared to GL9 network lacking PEG, protein adsorption as well as platelet and S, epidermidis adhesion to GL9-PEG networks were significantly reduced as the molecular weight and content of PEG was increased, indicating that GL9-PEG networks are more biocompatible than the GL9 network due to PEG's passivity. Based on the physical and biological characterization reported, the GL9-PEG materials would appear to be interesting candidates as matrices for tissue engineering.","Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Biomat Res Ctr, Seoul 130650, South Korea; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland","Kim, YH (reprint author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Biomat Res Ctr, POB 131, Seoul 130650, South Korea.",yhakim@kistmail.kist.re.kr,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456; Han, Dong Keun/0000-0003-4641-7883",,,,30,53,55,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To determine the utility of elastomeric materials as substrates for such applications, we asked whether skeletal myogenesis would be supported on a commercially available polyurethane, Tecoflex(R) SG-80A. G8 skeletal myoblasts were cultured on Tecoflex(R) two-dimensional solid thin films fabricated by a spin-casting method. Myoblasts attached, proliferated, displayed migratory activity and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes which expressed myosin heavy chain on solid thin films indicating that Tecoflex(R) SG-80A was permissive for skeletal myogenesis. Porous three-dimensional (3-D) cell scaffolds were fabricated in a variety of shapes, thicknesses, and porosities by an immersion precipitation method, and where subsequently characterized with microscopic and mechanical methods. Mechanical analysis revealed that the constructs were elastomeric, recovering their original length following 100% elongation. The 3-D substrates were seeded with muscle precursors to determine if muscle differentiation could be obtained within the porous network of the fabricated constructs. Following several weeks in culture, histological studies revealed the presence of multinucleated myotubes within the elastomeric material. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the myotubes expressed the myosin heavy chain protein suggesting that the myotubes had reached a state of terminal differentiation. Together the results of the study suggest that it is indeed feasible to engineer bioartificial systems consisting of skeletal muscle cultivated on a 3-D elastomeric substrate.","Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Tissue Engn Lab, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Tresco, PA (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Tissue Engn Lab, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",PatrickTresco@m.cc.utah.edu,,,,,,35,45,45,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

All six polymers, prepared using recombinant DNA technology, expressed at good levels using transformed E. coli fermentation. These E. coli-produced polymers were purified For the first time to the exacting levels required for use as biomaterials where a large quantity could disperse into the tissues in a few days. Time periods of 2 and 4 weeks were used, Polymer I functioned as a bulking agent around which a fine fibrous capsule formed. Inclusion of (GVGVAP)(8), a chemoattractant toward monocytes and elastin-synthesizing fibroblasts in the sequence of polymer I, resulted in an appropriate tissue response of invasion of macrophages. Inclusion of lysine residues, for lysyl oxidase cross-linking, suggested a possible remodeling of the implant toward fibers. Most promising however, when the cell attachment sequence, GRGDSP, was added to polymer I, the implant elicited tissue generation with a normal complement of collagen and elastic fibers, spindle-shaped histiocytes and angiogenesis, If this response is retained over time, the desired soft tissue augmentation and generation will have been achieved, Our working hypothesis is that on formation of elastin, with a half-life of the order of 70 years, a long lasting soft tissue augmentation would result rather than scar tissue as occurs with Contigen(R), the currently approved injectable implant for soft tissue augmentation.","Bioelast Res Ltd, OADI Technol Ctr, Birmingham, AL 35211 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Biol Proc Technol Inst, Gortner Labs 240, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Urry, DW (reprint author), Bioelast Res Ltd, OADI Technol Ctr, 2800 Milan Court,Suite 386, Birmingham, AL 35211 USA.",,,,NICHD NIH HHS [1 R43 HD34659-01],,,58,109,110,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In previous work showing that fibrinogen adsorbed to surfaces quickly becomes non-displaceable upon exposure to blood plasma, the fibrinogen was adsorbed from buffer, so we performed new studies in which the displaceability of fibrinogen adsorbed from plasma was characterized. Fibrinogen was adsorbed from 1% plasma to seven different surfaces for 1-64 min and then transferred to 100% plasma lacking radiolabeled fibrinogen and the amount adsorbed before and after transfer measured. The surfaces were glass, Silicone rubber, and five different polyurethanes. As adsorption time increased, the fibrinogen became increasingly resistant to displacement during the 100% plasma step, but the rate of increase in resistance varied greatly with surface type. Fibrinogen adsorbed from 1% plasma evidently undergoes rapid, surface dependent transitions. This work shows that the transitions that occur when the fibrinogen is adsorbed from blood plasma are similar to what we have previously observed for fibrinogen adsorbed from buffer.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL19419, HL25951]",,,29,18,18,0,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Preseeding synthetic graft materials such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with endothelial cells (EC) has been examined in various in vitro and in vivo models. Although various studies provide encouraging results, clinical trials for EC seeding on synthetic grafts have not been equally successful. This paper provides a brief review of the various reports on EC seeding in animal and clinical studies. We discuss the inefficiencies associated with the EC seeding process and examine plasma protein treatment of the graft surfaces as a viable option for improving EC attachment, retention and spreading. As an alternative to exsisting therapies we present data on a heterogeneous ligand treatment of fibronectin (Fn) and avidin-biotin for enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion to ePTFE graft surfaces. Control consisted of HUVECs seeded on Fn treated ePTFE graft surfaces. Functionality of HUVECs was assessed by measuring prostacyclin production of cells on both homogeneous and heterogeneous ligand treated surfaces. Laminar flow studies with a variable width flow chamber and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure initial cell retention and observe initial cell spreading on ePTFE surfaces, respectively. HUVEC retention on heterogeneous ligand treated graft surface was significantly (p < 0.001) higher compared to homogeneous ligand treated surfaces for shear stress in the range of 10-30 dyn cm(-2) HUVEC showed more cellular spreading on the heterogeneous ligand treated surface after seeding for 1-2 h. In vivo experimentation was performed in immune deficient (nude) rats by replacing a section of both the femoral arteries with 8 mm long, 1 mm internal diameter denucleated ePTFE grafts treated with homogeneous and heterogeneous ligands respectively Both grafts were seeded with similar cell density for 15 min prior to implantation. EC attachment and retention was measured by staining EC with hematoxylin and counting the cells before and after flow using light microscopy. The results indicate that a heterogeneous ligand treatment of graft surfaces using avidin-biotin and Fn-integrin attachment mechanisms increase cell seeding efficiency, initial cell retention and cellular spreading.","Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Ctr Cellular & Biosurface Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Reichert, WM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,"Truskey, George/B-2215-2012","Truskey, George/0000-0002-6885-4489","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-44972, HL-32132]",,,89,56,57,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The nature of the Mab dictated the nature of the response: anti-albumin antibodies were used to prevent cell and platelet adhesion in vitro, whilst anti-fibronectin Mabs promoted attachment. Patterned surfaces could be formed, bearing Mabs that generated adhesive and non-adhesive regions. Fibrinogen adsorption from plasma showed a Vroman peak on unmodified control polymer, which was reduced by 64% in the presence of surface-bound anti-albumin Mab. Immobilization of a control Mab reduced fibrinogen adsorption only slightly, implying an albumin-mediated effect. In static tests, platelet adhesion from human platelet rich plasma was significantly reduced by the immobilization of anti-HSA Mab when compared to the untreated FEP surface (p < 0.0001). This effect was also seen with citrated blood flowing through Mab-treated polyurethane tubing at a shear rate of 132 s(-1) (p = 0.034).

However, the mechanism by which adsorbed fibrinogen affects phagocyte responses is still not clear. To investigate the molecular interaction between fibrinogen and biomaterials, fibrinogen fragments (D100 and E50) were generated and used in the present study. The results indicate that biomaterial:D100 interaction is essential to fibrinogen-mediated inflammatory responses, because biomaterials precoated with D100, but not E50, prompt strong inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the results from in vitro studies show that whole molecule fibrinogen and D100 exhibit very similar protein:surface interactions. Specifically: (1) both D100 and fibrinogen have high affinity for biomaterial surfaces; and (2) the retention rates of adsorbed D100 in both in vivo and in vitro environments are as high as that for adsorbed fibrinogen. On the other hand, E50 does bind to biomaterials but with low affinity because, once bound, it is not tightly adherent to the biomaterial surfaces. Taken together, the results suggest that the mechanism of fibrinogen mediated inflammatory responses may involve the following three consecutive events: (1) after contact with blood or tissue fluid, the D domain tends to interact with biomaterial surfaces and is important in the tight binding of fibrinogen to implant surfaces; (2) the biomaterial surface then promotes conformational changes within the D domain, exposing P1 epitope (gamma 190-202, which interacts with phaocyte Mac-1 integrin); and (3) the engagement of Mac-1 integrin with P1 epitope then triggers subsequent phagocyte adherence and reactions.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tang, LP (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",,,,,,,34,37,38,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Activated products of the coagulation cascade may then enhance the inflammatory responses associated with wound healing. In the present investigation the ability of rat osteosarcoma. (ROS) cells to express TF activity was examined following their growth on tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) and selected orthopedic biomaterials (titanium and zirconium alloys, and stainless steel). ROS cells exhibited significant TF activity as evidenced by the conversion of Factor X to Factor Xa in the presence of TF Factor VIIa, and Ca2+. Factor Xa concentrations ranged from 1.0 fM per cell at 10 min to 6.0 fM pel cell after 60 min. Additionally, ROS cells stimulated with calcium ionophore (A13187) exhibited approximately twice the activity of non-stimulated cells when grown on TCPS but not on the metallic substrates. ROS cells (stimulated or unstimulated) adherent to the zirconium alloy generated lower amounts of Factor Xa compared to those bound to the other alloys and unstimulated cells grown on TCPS, These results indicate that ROS cells cultured on these synthetic surfaces differentially express procoagulant activity and that cells grown on TCPS, but not the metallic alloys, exhibit increased TF activity in response to stimulation by calcium ionophore. This procoagulant activity may potentiate subsequent inflammatory responses associated with the use of orthopedic biomaterials and thereby influence the tissue compatibility of the implant.","Memphis State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Slack, SM (reprint author), Memphis State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Campus Box 526582, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",,,,,,,9,6,6,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The nature of the materials may affect the attachment and/or the activation of these cells procoagulant responses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to measure the strength of adhesion of these vascular cells to potential biomaterials (titanium, zirconium alloys, and stainless steel) by exposing them to a range of shear stresses (50-300 dyn cm(-2)) in a parallel plate flow chamber. The procoagulant responses of the cells a ere evaluated by measuring the tissue factor (TF) activity promoted by the different materials under flow conditions. The materials supported distinctly different levels of initial cell adhesion in static culture. However, the fraction of adherent cells did not decline significantly with incrementally increasing shear stress within the range tested. TF expression, as measured by factor Xa (FXa) production, was material-dependent. For example, cells cultured on Ti1313 exhibited more FXa production (13.2 nhl 10(-5) cells) than Ti1313(DH) (8.5 nM 10(-5) cells) or stainless steel (2 nM 10(-5) cells). Thus, our studies indicate that the level of adhesion, strength of attachment and the expression of procoagulant activity of adherent vascular cells depend strongly on the nature of the underlying biomaterial.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Hall, CL (reprint author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Campus Box 526582, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",clhall@memphis.edu,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL 29019],,,34,11,11,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The first and least understood step in biomaterial-associated infections is the initial interaction between bacteria and a surface. This initial interaction can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the physiochemical nature of the biological and synthetic surfaces, as well as the properties of the interstitial fluid. We have shown that atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be employed as an exquisitely sensitive and versatile tool for quantifying the interaction between bacteria and surfaces in physiological solutions. The forces of interaction between an AFM cantilever tip and a uniform lawn of bacteria immobilized on glass were determined. By comparing the interactions of cantilever tips with lawns of isogenic E. coli strains carrying genetic lesions that alter their cell surface composition, it was possible to evaluate the effect of macromolecules such as lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide on the adhesion process. Mutations that result in the synthesis of truncated lipopolysaccharide or in the overproduction of the negatively charged capsular polysaccharide colanic acid render the interaction of the bacteria. with the AFM tip unfavorable due to increased electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, AFM could be used to evaluate the adhesion of bacteria. onto commercially relevant biomaterials. In one approach, micron-size polystyrene beads were attached to AFM tips which Mere then used to measure forces. Unfortunately, this approach is limited by the meager number of materials manufactured as bead, of a size suitable for AFM measurements. As an alternative approach, AFM cantilever tips were coated with a confluent layer of bacteria and used to probe planar surfaces. In this configuration, AFM could be employed to measure the force of interaction between virtually any bacterium and surface of interest.","Univ Texas, Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Petr Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Georgiou, G (reprint author), Univ Texas, Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,37,54,55,1,21,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The polymers are methoxypolyoxyethylene amine (PEGA1) and polyoxyethylene bis(amine) (PEGA2), which contain charged amine groups at one or both ends, respectively, with PEG as the backbone. The coating of the microcapsules with PEG-amine resulted in a much smoother capsule surface than A-P-A microcapsule surfaces as examined under a scanning electron microscope. The diffusivity of bovine serum albumin into the microcapsules remained the same after PEGA1 coating. But the diffusivity decreased to less than one-fifth that in A-P-A microcapsules coated with PEGA2. The biocompatibility of the microcapsules also improved as investigated by an in vivo study. Microcapsules were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice and retrieved 120 d after implantation. The fibrotic action against A-P-A microcapsules was severe and the capsules retrieved by peritoneal lavage aggregated into clusters. In contrast, the surface-modified capsules were free-flowing and free of cell overgrowth. Secretion of insulin from rat islets within A-P-A-PEGA microcapsules responded well to changes in glucose concentration in a static glucose test. Intraperitoneal transplantation of the microencapsulated islets into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice could maintain normal blood glucose levels in test animals for up to 200 d without immunosuppression.","Chang Gung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan; Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan","Chen, JP (reprint author), Chang Gung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kwei Sun, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan.",,,"Chen, Jyh-Ping/0000-0001-6527-4801; Fu, Shin-Huei/0000-0001-9697-6814",,,,18,27,29,0,14,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA, 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

Existing methods are either complicated or not applicable to systems utilizing collagen-based materials, and the development of a rapid and simple technique would be an advantage. In the current paper, a method is described which relies on the radiolabelling of newly synthesized protein with [(3)H]-proline followed by specific precipitation of collagen using 1% sirius red dissolved in water. The results indicate that collagen binding to sirius red is unaffected by using water rather than picric acid as a solvent and the dye binds in a similar fashion to collagen type I, II and III. Cycloheximide treatment of the gels indicated that precipitated [(3)H]-proline was restricted to macromolecular protein. Collagenase treatment eradicated labelled precipitation formation when using 1% sirius red in water, indicating a high degree of specificity for collagen whilst specificity was poor when using 1% sirius red in picric acid. The method described is both simple and rapid and shows a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. For these reasons it is highly suited for the assessment of collagen synthesis by cells in collagen-based materials.","UCL, Sch Med, Inst Orthopaed, IRC Biomed Mat, Stanmore HA7 4LP, Middx, England; Univ London Queen Mary & Westfield Coll, IRC Biomed Mat, London E1 4NS, England","Lee, DA (reprint author), UCL, Sch Med, Inst Orthopaed, IRC Biomed Mat, Brockley Hill, Stanmore HA7 4LP, Middx, England.",,,"Lee, David/0000-0001-7646-4643",,,,17,26,26,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The uptake of nickel by cells in the oral tissues is a critical factor in assessing the biological liabilities of nickel. Nickel uptake by macrophages may be particularly important because of the central role of macrophages in the inflammatory process and the known role of the macrophage in orchestrating the response to biomaterials. The aims of the current study were to assess the reversibility of the uptake of nickel from human macrophages and determine the portion of the nickel which reaches the nuclei as a function of time. Cellular nickel content was measured by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. Nuclear nickel content was assessed after fractionating cells. The results showed that nickel was rapidly taken up by macrophages and that the nickel accumulated in the nucleus in as little as 8 h. After 48 h, over 60% of the cellular nickel was in the nucleus. Once taken up, the nickel was lost at a lower rate. The rate of loss decreased as the initial exposure time to the nickel increased. Thus, the results indicated that macrophages may accumulate nickel if the time between exposures is insufficient to reverse the uptake. Further studies are necessary to correlate the retention of nickel with impaired function of macrophages and to further define the biological risks of using nickel in dental alloys.","Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Dent, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Wataha, JC (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,31,23,24,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-182X,,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The stimulation of fibroblast growth is essential for the normal healing and tissue integration of biomaterials. The local elevation of proinflammatory mediators in infected perigraft fluid (PGF) may inhibit this growth. We sought to determine whether infected PGF inhibited fibroblast growth, and, if so, whether this was primarily dependent on the biomaterial, bacteria, or host. Methods. In vivo Dacron or expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts, sterile or colonized with slime-producing (RP-62A, viable or formalin-killed) or nonslime-producing (RP-62NA) Staphylococcus epidermidis (1 x 10(7) CFU/cm(2)), were implanted in Swiss Webster mice, and the PGF was harvested at 7 and 28 days. Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 alpha, interferon gamma (7 gamma g/day), and indomethacin (50 mu g/day) were administered by microinfusion pumps for 7 days and the PGF was harvested. Inhibition of the proinflammatory mediators was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. The nontreated, heat-treated, or trypsin-digested in vivo PGF was incubated with an in vitro [H-3]thymidine murine fibroblast (ATCC CCL-12) proliferation assay. Results. Fibroblast inhibition was significant at 7 and 28 days with infected PGF incubation compared with sterile and was not dependent on bacterial slime production or viability. Dacron sterile PGF did not significantly inhibit fibroblasts compared with control, whereas sterile ePTFE stimulated (P < 0.05) fibroblasts, Treatment of the PGF with proinflammatory cytokines, heat, and trypsin failed to reverse fibroblast inhibition in the infected state. Conclusion. Biomaterial infection is associated with fibroblast inhibition that is dependent primarily on bacterial products and not the host or biomaterial, Conservative intervention strategies for graft infection need to address the problem of poor healing as well as bacterial clearance.

Polyurethanes were used as the model materials. The tumor promoting activities of polyurethanes were strong, whereas the initiating activities were weak. Such promoting activities were associated with the inhibition of the function of the connexins which play an important role in the gap-junctional intercellular communications, and the inhibition might be caused by many factors such as additives, catalysts, leachable oligomers, and material surface characteristic, which have tumor-promoting activities via inhibitory action on gap-junctional intercellular communication in polymers. From these results, two in vitro methods, namely gap-junctional intercellular communication test (example: V79 metabolic cooperation test) and 2-stage Balb 3T3 cell transformation test, are considered to be useful for evaluating the tumorigenic potentials of polymers.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Divices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1580098, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Divices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1580098, Japan.",,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,SOC POLYMER SCIENCE JAPAN,TOKYO,"TSUKIJI DAISAN NAGAOKA BLDG, 2-4-2 TSUKIJI, CHUO-KU, TOKYO, 104, JAPAN",0386-2186,,,KOBUNSHI RONBUNSHU,Kobunshi Ronbunshu,,1998.0,55,6,,,,,314,322,,10.1295/koron.55.314,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,ZW947,WOS:000074464300002,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Nitrogen ions of 500 eV/at. and argon ions of 3 keV/at. under partial pressure of oxygen were used to bombard the surface of polycarbonate (PC) samples to a fluence of 5x10(16) at/cm(2) and 2.1x10(17) at./cm(2), respectively. After implantation, the samples were stored in two different environments (oxygen and argon) over controlled intervals of time (1 to 24 hours). Characterization of samples was performed by means of XPS, ERD ExB and RES. The results show an increase of the oxygen concentration near the surface for all implanted samples. Also, desorption of hydrogen was observed after implantation of argon under a partial pressure of oxygen. These results confirm the formation of new functional groups such as C-OK for all treatments.

The experimental and theoretical melting curves are both fairly symmetrical and possess nearly identical T-m values. Calculated melting of coding and flanking DNA regions indicates that flanking DNAs are more (A+T)-rich than coding sequences and account for the earliest melting DNA. Calculated melting curves of the 16 individual yeast chromosomes are very similar and with few exceptions exhibit symmetric melting curves. MELTSIM was also used to calculate a theoretical denaturation map of Chromosome III DNA. The agreement between MELTSIM calculated and experimental melting data demonstrates our ability to accurately simulate long DNA sequence melting in complex eukaryotic genomes, whose sequences are becoming increasingly available for study in public databases. This has important consequences for the understanding of sequence dependent energetic properties of DNA in their biological sequence context and also for their potential use in biomaterials applications.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Lowell, MA 01854 USA","Bizzaro, JW (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.",,,,,,,0,5,5,0,1,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-394-0,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,1998.0,489,,,,,,73,75,,,,,,3,Biophysics; Cell Biology,Biophysics; Cell Biology,BM11Z,WOS:000077674600012,,,,,2019-02-25

Multicomponent blends of synthetic, semi-synthetic and naturally occurring macromolecules have been evaluated with a particular interest in the preparation of immunoisolation barriers for pancreatic islets. A screening has resulted in thirty three polymeric systems which have been compared according to their mechanical strength, capsule characteristics (such as shape, surface smoothness, stability, and swelling/shrinking) and per meability (MWCO). A limited number of tests were also carried out on the cell viability in the presence of polymer mixtures. These included measurements of the perifusion of encapsulated pancreatic islets and the host tissue response. The quality of the membrane produced was observed to be a strong function of the polymer properties, processing conditions, such as the type and concentration of the simple electrolyte, and the reaction time. Additionally, a multi component polyelectrolyte technology based on the formation of a capsular ""wall-complex"" was developed for the simultaneous optimization of the membrane mechanical properties and permeability. This involved the preparation of a wide pore matrix through the reaction of a core polyanion with a small ionotropic ion. A second, low or medium molecular weight, polycation was subsequently added, in a second reactive stage, and its time dependent diffusion into the capsule could be used to control the membrane wall thickness and permeability. Alternatively, the simultaneous application of low and high molecular weight cations (or a divalent and polyvalent cation) often led to capsules with similar controllable properties. For many combinations, a distinct capsular wall was observed. Overall seven chemistries were identified as providing suitable permeability and capsular mechanical properties. All contained an anionic polysaccharide blend interior to an oligocation solution. The alginate/cellulose sulfate//polymethylene-co-guanidine/calcium chloride/sodium chloride system was found to be the most viable alternative to the standard alginate-polylysine-alginate capsule (APA).","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Polymers & Biomat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med Endocrinol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Micrograv Res & Applicat, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Hunkeler, D (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Polymers & Biomat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",david.hunkeler@epfl.ch,,,,,,29,42,45,0,14,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN 33,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, W-1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,,,1998.0,136,,,,,,53,73,,,,,,21,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,BL16Q,WOS:000074527400002,,,,,2019-02-25

That EC might be very relevant to other aspects of haemocompatibility has not received much attention. The highly reactive nature of the endothelium, however, makes it an important candidate for a regulatory role in the reactions to intravascular implants, whether in the short-term (e.g. catheters, haemodialysis) or in the long-term, as in prosthetic heart valves or vascular stents. In the present paper the ability of biomaterials to alter the activation state of the endothelium, both in the vicinity of, as well as at a distance from a cardiovascular implant, will be discussed. Among the relevant activating signals affecting EC are metal ions, bacterial toxins and mediators from blood cells and plasma cascade systems, which can elicit EC production of inflammatory mediators and up-regulate cell adhesion molecules (CAM). This in turn can lead to an amplification of the inflammatory response. These complex reactions are intricately involved in the complications associated with such biomaterial applications. Nevertheless, knowledge of these pathomechanisms could offer the possibility of therapeutic control, in order to minimize the negative effects.

Many currently applied biomaterials are selected more or less on an empirical basis because knowledge of the basic mechanisms of cell-material interactions is still limited. Indeed,a better understanding of the ongoing processes at the cellular and intracellular level during interaction of anchorage-dependent cells with biomaterials may help in the development of tailor-made biomaterials. Much of the contemporary research activities restrict to investigations of the characterisation of physicochemical material properties, protein adsorption, and macroscopic parameters of cell behaviour. We have tried to relate the change in tissue compatibility, with altered wettability of model substrata, to the adsorption of fibronectin (FN), the organisation of integrin receptors (alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin), cellular signalling processes, and FN matrix formation. Results of these investigations have shown that a decreased compatibility of biomaterials seems to be due to conformational changes of FN adsorbed with high binding strength on the substratum which inhibits appropriate organisation of FN receptors and signal transmission into the cell. As a consequence, it was observed that cells could not organise a normal extracellular matrix and hadtherefore a decreased ability to proliferate.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Chem, D-145613 Teltow, Germany","Groth, T (reprint author), GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Chem, Kantstr 55, D-145613 Teltow, Germany.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,0,15,15,0,0,I O S PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-6743,,90-5199-365-X,BIOM HLTH R,,,1998.0,16,,,,,,12,23,,,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,BL79T,WOS:000076774700002,,,,,2019-02-25

Prime factors in the thrombogenicity of synthetic materials in contact with blood include gas nuclei at the blood gas interface as well as the inherent thrombogenicity of the materials themselves. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular prostheses were denucleated by placement in acetone and ethanol followed by degassed saline or by placement in degassed saline subjected to hydrostatic pressure. Heparinized grafts were prepared by coating with tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC), followed by immersion in heparin. Grafts were installed to reconstruct-the femoral artery (1 x 10 mm) or as renal iliac bypasses (1 x 50 mm) in rats. In the femoral artery reconstruction model, control grafts thrombosed within 10 minutes of implantation. All acetone denucleated femoral grafts remained patent for 60 minutes but were occluded at day 1. All pressure denucleated femoral grafts remained patent for 60 minutes, whereas six were patent at 1 month. In contrast, 11 of 15 heparinized femoral grafts were patent at 1 month. In the renal iliac bypass model, all control grafts were thrombosed within 10 minutes, whereas all heparin bonded grafts remained patent at 1 month. This finding confirms that removal of air from small diameter ePTFE grafts decreases acute thrombogenicity and that heparin bonding further decreases thrombogenicity, suggesting that clinically useful lengths of microvascular prostheses may be possible.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Surg, Div Plast Reconstruct Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Plast Surg Res Labs, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Klitzman, B (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Box 3906, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",,,,,,,21,18,20,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0032-1052,1529-4242,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

Rutile was selected as the reference, and the Reference Intensity Ratios (RIR) were accurately measured. A RIR database of XRPD quantitative analysis for biomaterials based on calcium phosphate was established. The principals and method of RIR quantitative analysis were introduced. The phase amounts of biomaterials based on calcium phosphate could be analyzed accurately, quickly and conveniently. The relative error is less than 5%. The absorption effect was totally eliminated and the cumbersome calibration curve procedure was shunted.

The national and international standards for testing regimes represent a lowest common denominator for such applications and do not necessarily ensure that optimal function will be achieved. The authors' thesis is that biocompatibility testing has scope for extensive development with respect to biofunctionality. The present paper reviews current trends in the in vitro aspects of biocompatibility testing. As well as a critical appraisal of the recent literature, future trends are also stressed, which the authors regard as essential for a meaningful integration of a modern biological approach into new developments in the material sciences.

Although bone banks, such as Eurotransplant, are founded to supply such substitutes, natural bone is not always adequate. For-example, frequently these so-called bone grafts resorb after implantation (1). Further, they cannot be used for joint and tooth replacement, and recently worries have been raised about the transfer of infectious diseases. Therefore, interest has dramatically increased in the use of synthetic materials for replacement of lost or damaged bone tissue. The generic name of these tissue alternatives is biomaterials. A special class of these biomaterials is composed of metallic devices with coatings to improve bone bonding. These specialized coatings used to improve the metallic implant are the topic of this paper.","Leiden Univ, Biomat Res Grp, Leiden, Netherlands","de Groot, K (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Biomat Res Grp, Leiden, Netherlands.",,"Wolke, J.G.C./L-4768-2015",,,,,103,182,182,2,44,PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD,BURY ST EDMUNDS,"NORTHGATE AVENUE,, BURY ST EDMUNDS, SUFFOLK, ENGLAND IP32 6BW",0954-4119,,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

It is recently considered that wear of the UHMWPE cup is of major concern. Generation of the wear debris can have adverse effects on the body, both localized and systemic. It is envisaged that wear of the prosthetic components, particularly those fabricated from UHMWPE can be reduced through the use of surface coatings. The aim of this investigation was to deposit a selection of refractory element nitride-based coatings (TiN, TiAIN, ZrN) onto 316L stainless steel substrates, using physical vapour deposition (PVD) technology and to study their sliding wear behaviour in contact with both UHMWPE and 316L stainless steel pins, using a pin-on-plate testing rig. Tests were conducted in Ringers solution and Ringers solution plus bone cement particles. The volume of material removed from the pins served as an indication of their wear behaviour. Wear mechanisms were identified using scanning electron microscopy. The results of these findings and the potential for these coatings to be used in orthopaedic applications are discussed.","Univ S Australia, Ian Wark Res Inst, The Levels, SA, Australia","Ward, LP (reprint author), Royal Melbourne Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",,"Ward, Liam/B-5033-2019","Ward, Liam/0000-0002-8025-7425",,,,30,23,23,2,9,PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD,BURY ST EDMUNDS,"NORTHGATE AVENUE,, BURY ST EDMUNDS, SUFFOLK, ENGLAND IP32 6BW",0954-4119,,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

In this paper the use of computer modelling for the design of biomaterials is discussed. The word 'biomaterials' is interpreted in its broadest sense, i.e. referring to any foreign object brought into the body for temporary or permanent use. Computer modelling will first be discussed as a tool to model biological structures (bones, arteries) or to investigate and simulate biological interactions at implant-host interfaces. It will then be illustrated how computer modelling, using insights gained from the modelling of the biological structures themselves, is used in the design process of dental, orthopaedic and cardiovascular prostheses. The area of computer modelling for biomaterials applications has become so vast that an exhaustive overview is impossible in the framework of one paper. Rather, some illustrative case studies will be discussed which are, in the opinion of the authors, representative of general trends in this challenging domain of science on the boundary between engineering and medicine.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Biomech & Engn Design, Louvain, Belgium","Sloten, JV (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Biomech & Engn Design, Louvain, Belgium.",,"HO BA THO, Marie-Christine/J-1946-2012","HO BA THO, Marie-Christine/0000-0003-1192-0075",,,,90,11,12,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0954-4119,2041-3033,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

It is now routinely being deposited onto the stems of surgical implants to achieve cementless fixation to bone. Despite its favourable osteoconductive and bioactive properties, HA is still a main obstacle in the area of orthopaedics applications where implants have to withstand medium high loading. Therefore, to bridge the gap in biomaterials with HA having low load bearing characteristics, bioceramic composite coatings are being developed. Two different kinds of HA composite coatings are being studied, namely HA/Ti-6Al-4V and HA/Y-ZrO2 (Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia). HA combined with non-toxicity and bioinert Ti-6Al-4V provides an implant that is biocompatible, light and stable. Likewise, HA combined with biocompatible Y-ZrO2 gives an implant that is favourable in its strength and fracture toughness. plasma spraying technique is a popular method of depositing the composite powders. This paper investigates the influence of plasma spraying currents and gun transverse speeds on the characteristics of the composite coatings. Mechanical properties of the individual layers were tested using the tensile adhesion test (ASTM C-633). The surface morphology and microstructure of the composite layers were examined by a backscattered scanning electron microscope. The phase composition and crystallinity were determined by the X-ray diffractometer. For HA/Ti6Al-4V coatings, investigations revealed that the individual layers are more porous in the HA-rich regions. Tensile adhesion test showed a higher bond strength for the composite coatings compared to pure HA coatings. A lower spraying current and a faster gun transverse speed are also accountable for the porous microstructure and low bonding strength. For HAPT-ZrO2 coatings, the amount of HA decomposition increases with increasing spraying currents. The impurities were alpha-TCP and CaO with small amount of TTCP being detected. Y-ZrO2 reacted with CaO in HA to form CaZrO3, which caused an increase in the decomposition of the CaO-poor HA.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Khor, KA (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,"Khor, Khiam Aik/G-2827-2010; Khor, Khiam Aik (Michael)/B-6929-2009","KHOR, Khiam/0000-0003-1954-8423",,,,0,0,0,0,9,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-415-1,,,,1998.0,,,,,,,195,209,,,,,,15,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM03W,WOS:000077459300014,,,,,2019-02-25

It has been established that solid waste incineration resulted in a formation of a slag product composed of stable mineral phases: oxyapatite, nagelschmidtite, spinels, karnegiite, which can be considered as host phases for radionuclide immobilization. Waste vitrification with metal fuel yields an amorphous phase which is predominant in final products, and a small amount of crystalline phases. Preliminary leaching tests were carried out.

These multifaceted requirements can be met by functionally graded materials (FGM). Biomaterials for implants have to display a wide range of adaptability to suit the various stages of the biointegration of a foreign material into the human body. This paper reports the preparation of functionally graded bioceramic coatings that are composed of essentially calcium phosphate compounds. Two FGM systems were investigated. System 1 utilised the thermal response of different size ranges of hydroxyapatite (HA) powders in the plasma name to form the gradient in biological/physical properties while System 2 synergized two types of calcium phosphates, namely, cr-tricalcium phosphate and HA, to form the FGM. The coating is graded in accordance to adhesive strength and bioresorbability. The bond coat on the metal stub is deposited with a particle range of HA that will provide high adhesive strength but have poor biocompatibility. The top coat of System 1 is composed of a particle size range of HA that elicit a layer that is highly biocompatible while in System 2, the top coat is mainly a-tricalcium phosphate that is highly bioresorbable. This arrangement has the propensity of allowing accelerated biointegration of the coating by the body tissues. The processing steps and problems will be highlighted in this paper as well as the results of post-spray treatment by conventional heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing (HIP).","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Khor, KA (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,"Khor, Khiam Aik/G-2827-2010; Khor, Khiam Aik (Michael)/B-6929-2009",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,INST MATERIALS,LONDON,"1 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5DB, ENGLAND",,,1-86125-055-X,,,,1998.0,,,,,,,1038,1050,,,,,,13,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BN40T,WOS:000081833400113,,,,,2019-02-25

Heparin was partially degraded and the resulting fragments were covalently end-point attached to 0.5 cm long silicone biomaterial surface. Collagen type I was immobilized on the heparinized biomaterials and then cross-linked with acyl-azide or carbodiimide. Finally, the resulting biosurfaces were exposed to antibiotics, i.e. rifampicin in combination with cefuroxime, fusidic acid, ofloxacin or vancomycin, respectively. The antibiotic bonded biomaterials were evaluated for their anti-staphylococcal activity after elution in NaCl, serum or blood by measuring the zones of inhibition for S. epidermidis strain RP12. Furthermore, we examined the in-vitro colonization resistance to S. epidermidis RP12 for these combinations of rifampicin-bonded biomaterials by an ATP bioluminescence assay. The ATP measurements showed that initially adherent bacteria were eradicated from the polymer surface, for at least 24 or 48 h (fusidic acid > cefuroxime > vancomycin > ofloxacin).

As expected, protein adsorption was found to depend on the deg ree of hydrophobicity of the surfaces and on the concentration of the surfactant. A reduction of 90% in albumin adsorption on hydrophobic methylated surfaces by 0.05% Tween 20 was achieved, whereas a reduction of only 15% on hydrophilic surfaces was observed. Experiments of time-dependent protein adsorption in both pure protein and protein-surfactant mixtures were conducted to ascertain the stability of physically adsorbed Tween 20 films on intermediate silicon surfaces. It was found that the adsorbed Tween 20 film was robust and there was no evidence of exchange of the Tween molecules with albumin for up to 240 min exposure. Adsorption minima were confirmed to correlate with minima in contact angle and critical micelle concentration (CMC).

Quantification involved direct now cytometric analysis of the heads after the bound complement proteins were indirectly fluorescently tagged by use of a monoclonal antibody against a complement protein: C5b-9, iC3b, C3d, C4d, Bb, C3a, and C1q. Calibration with fluorescein microbead standards demonstrated that the membrane attack complex (SC5b-9) was surface bound on all surfaces and that the surface concentration gradually increased to levels as high as 0.5 mu g/cm(2). Further, the surface bound represented a substantial percentage of the total generated. The iC3b level on polystyrene beads rapidly reached 0.09 mu g/cm(2) and the C3d levels were an order of magnitude less. On agarose beads the iC3b levels continually rose to 0.17 mu g/cm(2) and, as before, the C3d levels were substantially lower. The surface concentration of C4d and Bb on both surfaces were significant but less than 1.0 ng/cm(2). There was minimal evidence of C3a and C1q adsorption for any surface. Use of amino-polystyrene beads moderately reduced the level of bound iC3b, C3d, and SC5b-9, whereas carboxylated beads reduced the levels by almost a factor of two. The appreciable amounts of iC3b and SC5b-9 consistently noted on the artificial surfaces tested in this paper suggests that for these two activation products in vitro analysis of material induced complement activation should also include surface analysis.

Exudates of varying volumes were produced that was comprised of granulocytes, monocytes, immature and mature macrophages, and T-lymphocytes. No B-lymphocytes were observed at any time periods. Cell types were identified by their granularity and positivity to the following antibodies: leucocyte common antigen (LCA, pan leucocyte); CD11b/c (macrophage/monocyte); CD5 (T-lymphocyte); CD45RA (B-lymphocyte); HIS48 (granulocyte); ED2 (mature macrophage); and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1). Monocytes isolated from control rat blood demonstrated a size slightly larger than that of granulocytes but with less granularity. Their size and granularity were followed over increasing time periods. The macrophages elicited by UHMWPE showed a similar pattern, with the exception of an apparently highly granular subpopulation with volumes similar to that of granulocytes but significantly more granular. The granular macrophage subset had a very high degree of ED2 and MCP-1 positivity, and their proportion, compared with other macrophages, was greatest at 2 days. The high MCP-1 expression was accounted for by MCP-1 molecules bound to the surface of a small proportion of macrophages that were activated. It is postulated that this subpopulation was responsible for the synthesis of the MCP-1 and could indicate a mechanism by which monocytes are attracted to the site of an implanted material.

Small intestinal submucosa (SIS), as isolated, is primarily an acellular extracellular matrix material. In an attempt to discover the components of small intestinal submucosa which are able to induce this tissue remodelling, the material was extracted and extracts were tested for the ability to stimulate Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts to synthesize DNA and proliferate. Each of the four different extracts of small intestinal submucosa had measurable cell-stimulating activity when analysed in both a whole cell proliferation assay (alamarBlue dye reduction) and a DNA synthesis assay ([H-3]-thymidine incorporation). Proteins extracted from SIS with 2 M urea induced activity profiles in the two assays which were very similar to the activity profiles of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) in the assays. As well, the changes in cell morphology in response to the extracted proteins mimicked the changes induced by FGF-2. Neutralization experiments with specific antibodies to this growth factor confirmed the presence of FGF-2 and indicated that it was responsible for 60% of the fibroblast-stimulating activity of the urea extract of small intestinal submucosa. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific for FGF-2 detected a reactive doublet at approximately 19 kDa and further confirmed the presence of FGF-2. Cell stimulating activity of proteins extracted from SIS with 4 M guanidine was neutralized by an antibody specific for transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). Changes in the morphology of the fibroblasts exposed to this extract were nearly identical to changes induced by TGF beta. Although no reactive protein band was detected at 25 kDa in nonreduced western blot analysis, several bands were reactive at higher molecular weight. The identity of this TGF beta-related component of small intestinal submucosa is unknown. Identification of FGF-2 and TGF beta-related activities in SIS, two growth factors known to significantly affect critical processes of tissue development and differentiation, provides the opportunity to further elucidate the mechanisms by which this extracellular matrix biomaterial modulates wound healing and tissue remodelling.

The bioelectrocatalytic functions of the enzyme in state 3a-GOx were blocked in the presence of 4 or 5: With 6 acting as electron mediator, the enzyme in state 3a-GOx exhibits bioelectrocatalytic activities for the oxidation of glucose, whereas the bioelectrocatalytic functions of the 3b-GOx state are blocked. The directionality of the enzyme photoswitch is controlled by the affinities of the oxidized electron mediators to diffusionally penetrate the protein and reach appropriate electron transfer distances to oxidize the FADH(2) redox center of the enzyme. In all of the systems, cyclic amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoisomerizable enzyme is accomplished.

Limited information is available on its effect on human cells. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that Bioglass(R) supports viability and proliferation of human bone cells. As a prototype of human bone cells, the osteoblast cell line MG63 was used and propagated on Bioglass(R) disks. MG63 cells also were seeded onto disks made of titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) and of cobalt chrome (Co-Cr-Mo) alloys. The number of viable cells recovered was similar for Bioglass(R), titanium, and polystyrene control surfaces. Significantly fewer cells were recovered from CoCr (P < 0.05) compared to Bioglass(R), Ti-6 Al-4v, and polystyrene surfaces. The proportion of cells undergoing DNA synthesis, estimated by thymidine uptake, was significantly greater on Bioglass(R) and titanium surfaces (P < 0.05) than on the CoCr surface. There were detectable differences in cell morphology on these biomaterials. Functional capacity was tested by assay of osteocalcin production and no differences were detectable among the different biomaterials. This study supports the hypothesis that 45S5 Bioglass(R) provides a favorable environment for human osteoblast proliferation and function.

Recent mathematical models of coagulation which are reviewed here suggest that such materials are impossible. This conclusion, which is certainly consistent with our collective experimental evidence, arises from the calculation that conversion of Factor XI to XIa never drops to zero even at the highest flow rates and with virtually no Factor XIIa bound to a surface. Residual amounts of XIa are still formed which can in principle kick-off the coagulation cascade. Furthermore, if the flow rates and corresponding mass transfer coefficients are low and in spite of these near-vanishing levels of the initiating coagulants, the surprising result is that substantial amounts of thrombin are produced. On the contrary, under slightly higher flow conditions, there can be more substantial levels of initiating coagulants, yet paradoxically thrombin production is near zero. This article presents a theoretical understanding of the events which take place during the interaction of biomaterials with flowing blood. We follow these events from the time of first contact to the final production of thrombin. The effect of flow and surface activity on the contact phase reactions is examined in detail and the two are found to be intertwined. The common pathway is also examined and here the main feature is the existence of three flow dependent regions which produce either high or very low levels of thrombin, as well as multiple thrombin steady states. In a final analysis we link the two segments of the cascade and consider the events which result. In addition, we note that multiple steady states arise only in the presence of two (thrombin) feedback loops. Single loops or the bare cascade will produce only single steady states. With some imagination one can attribute to the feedback loops the role of providing the cascade with a mechanism to produce high thrombin levels in case of acute need (e.g. bleeding) or to allow levels to subside to 'stand-by' when there is no need for clotting. We present this as a partial answer to the question: Why is the coagulation cascade so complex and what is the importance of the feedback loops? (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

Based on this concept, biospecific polymers have been produced synthetically by attaching biospecific 'keys' to the polymer chain. We postulate that biospecificity can be achieved by alternative means, namely random substitution of a preformed polymer with suitable chemical groups or random copolymerization of suitable functional monomers. Such polymers, we suggest, will contain arrangements of the chemical functions which mimic natural biospecific sites and the probability of occurrence of such arrangements will depend on the average composition of the polymer. In support of this principle, we have developed several functional random copolymer systems which possess a variety of biological properties depending on the type of chemical function. Examples are: polymers possessing anticoagulant properties similar to those of heparin; polymers which interact specifically with components of the immune system; and polymers which, in contact with cells, affect their growth and metabolism. In the case of statistical copolymers possessing 'DNA-like' properties obtained by phosphorylation of hydroxylated polystyrene derivatives, Monte Carte simulations were used to determine the distribution of phosphodiester (PDE) groups along the chains and to compute the probabilities of occurrence of particular arrangements of PDE found in the 'DNA-like' sites. The results showed that these sites are made up of PDE groups separated by distances that closely match those between the same groups along a generatrix of the DNA double-helix cylinder. These findings offer the prospect of manufacturing polymeric biomaterials endowed with biomimetic character. Moreover, they provide the basis for a hypothesis regarding the appearance of biospecificity at the origin of life, suggesting that biospecific structures may have evolved by natural selection from purely random copolymers. It is likely therefore that biospecificity is a continuous function of randomness, arising from purely statistical distributions of reactivity and evolving into precisely defined structures such as those involved in ligand-receptor interactions.

We have utilized PAN/PVC guidance channels to form solid human SC grafts which can be transplanted either with or without the channel. We studied the ability of grafts placed with and without channels to support regeneration ansi, to influence functional recovery; characteristics of the graft and host/graft interface wore also compared. The T9-T10 spinal cord of nude rats was resected and a graft was placed across the gap; methylprednisolone was delivered acutely to decrease secondary injury. Channels minimized the immigration of connective tissue into grafts but contributed to some necrotic tissue loss, especially in the distal spinal cord. Grafts without channels contained more myelinated axons ((x) over bar = 2129 +/- 785) vs ((x) over bar = 1442 +/- 514) and were larger in cross-sectional area ((x) over bar = 1.53 +/- 0.24 mm(2)) vs ((x) over bar = 0.95 +/- 0.86 mm(2)). The interfaces formed between the host spinal cord and the grafts placed without channels were highly interdigitated and resembled CNS-PNS transition zones; chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was deposited there. Whereas several neuronal populations including propriospinal, sensory, motoneuronal, and brainstem neurons regenerated into human SC grafts, only propriospinal and sensory neurons were observed to reenter the host spinal cord. Using combinations of anterograde and retrograde tracers, we observed regeneration of propriospinal neurons up to 2.6 mm beyond grafts. We estimate that 1% of the fibers that enter grabs reenter the host spinal cord by 45 days after grafting. Following retrograde tracing from the distal spinal cord, more labeled neurons were unexpectedly found in the region of the dextran amine anterograde tracer injection site where a marked inflammatory reaction had occurred. Animals with bridging grafts obtained modestly higher scores during open field [((x) over bar = 8.2 +/- 0.35) vs ((x) over bar = 6.8 +/- 0.42), P = 0.02] and inclined plane testing (x) over bar = 38.6 +/- 0.542) vs ((x) over bar = 36.3 +/- 0.53), P = 0.006] than animals with similar grafts in distally capped channels, in summary, this study showed that in the nude rat given methylprednisolone in combination with human SC grafts, some regenerative growth occurred beyond the graft and a modest improvement in function was observed, (C) 1997 Academic Press.","Univ Miami, Sch Med, Miami Project Cure Paralysis, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Sch Med, Organ Procurement Team, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Bunge, MB (reprint author), Univ Miami, Sch Med, Miami Project Cure Paralysis, 1600 NW 10th Ave,R-48, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",mbunge@miamiproj.med.miami.edu,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS09923, NS28059]",,,104,217,234,0,15,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4886,1090-2430,,EXP NEUROL,Exp.

These substrates were coated with a primer layer of trichlorovinylsilane (TCVS), which allows grafting of organic polymers. The TCVS-coated substrates were adsorbed with PEO or Pluronics (R) and exposed to 0.3 Mrad of gamma radiation to graft the polymer to the surface. PEO-grafted substrates were characterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fibrinogen adsorption, and platelet adhesion and activation. Surface modification with PEO reduced fibrinogen adsorption by as much as 99%. Platelet adhesion was significantly reduced or prevented on the modified surfaces. Protein-and platelet-resistance effects were independent of hydrophilicity of the PEO-grafted surfaces.

As the material degrades or absorbs, in vitro or in vivo, it undergoes structural, physical, and chemical changes. These changes in the base material may significantly impact the performance of a particular biomedical device; hence, it is important that the investigator consider the full range of properties that constitute the lifetime of a given absorbable material. The long term degradation study presented here sought to identify. one such property, the change in water retention of a degrading oriented polylactide film. The investigation found through differential scanning calorimetry that later stages of degradation are often characterized by a stronger retention of water, potentially due to a higher number of polar carboxyl groups within the relatively hydrophobic polymer matrix.

We have prepared several pHEMA-based biomaterials suitable as bone substitutes; alkaline phosphatase, for example, when immobilized in pHEMA in a copolymerization technique at 4 degrees C retains its biological activity. When pellets of the biomaterial were placed in synthetic body fluids or tissue culture medium containing organic phosphates, numerous calcified nodules formed spontaneously. Osteoblast-like cells harvested on pHEMA or pHEMA/alkaline phosphatase materials can spread and establish direct contacts. However, the hydrophilicity of pHEMA is a real handicap for preparing scanning and transmission electron microscopic analyses. We have found that 2-propanol was an excellent dehydrating preparing for scanning electron microscopy before critical point drying. HEMA itself was found to dehydrate the transmission electron microscopy blocks because it can copolymerize with the methacrylate-based embedding resin Lowicryl K4M.

These cells, upon interaction with any foreign material, might initiate a spectrum of responses, which could lead to acute and chronic inflammatory changes affecting the biocompatibility of the implant. Whether the mechanisms governing the type of evolving inflammatory reaction could be attributed to the macrophages functional differentiation mirrored by monocyte subsets during the polymer interaction, is poorly described. This in vitro study, therefore, attempted to investigate whether different biomaterials influence monocyte cellular activity, determined by the myeloperoxidase level and mitochondrial XTT cleavage, and phenotype dynamics characterized by the presence of CD14, RM 3/1 and 27E10 antigens. It is shown that different polymers exert differential potential to influence monocytes, both in their cellular activity and their phenotypic pattern.

Osteoblasts lining the distal surface of the newly formed bone were stained with all three RNA probes, although weaker than in the THA sample. Some of the osteoblasts were flattened. We concluded from the appearance of the osteoblasts that the bone formation in the nacre samples had progressed beyond the phase of maximal synthetic activity.

The essential features of this system are that the force sensitivity is in the sub-piconewton range and the gap distance between interacting stylus and the sample surfaces can be controlled with nanometer accuracy. We have achieved these technical improvements by using flexible handmade cantilevers with the spring constant of approximately 0.1 pN nm(-1). Thermal bending motions have been reduced to less than 1 nm in root-mean-square amplitude by exerting feedback forces with a laser radiation pressure. The performance of this newly developed scanning probe microscopy was tested by measuring electrostatic repulsive forces in solution. Intermolecular forces in the sub-piconewton range were resolved at controlled gaps in the nanometer range between an amino-silanized stylus and an amino-silanized glass surface, Force curves as a function of gap distance coincided well with the theory of electricity. Debye lengths calculated at various ionic strengths were in good agreement with the Debye-Huckel theory. Furthermore, non-contact two-dimensional images mapped with electrostatic forces within the piconewton range could also be obtained. This system should prove useful not only for constructing the surface topographies of soft biomaterials but also for mapping the surfaces with intermolecular forces which are closely related to their functions.","Osaka Univ, Dept Biophys Engn, Osaka 560, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Exploratory Res Adv Technol, BioMotron Project, Osaka 562, Japan; Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Osaka 565, Japan","Yanagida, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Dept Biophys Engn, Machikaneyana 1-3, Osaka 560, Japan.",,"Yanagida, Toshio/D-1919-2009",,,,,25,22,23,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3991,,,ULTRAMICROSCOPY,Ultramicroscopy,DEC,1997.0,70,1-2,,,,,45,55,,10.1016/S0304-3991(97)00069-7,,,,11,Microscopy,Microscopy,YP468,WOS:000071279800005,,,,,2019-02-25

PTFE films were photochemically reduced by exposure to short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light in the presence of the reducing agents, i.e., diphenyl ketyl radical anion, generated from a solution of benzophenone and sodium hydride in dimethylformamide (Noh et al., J. Polym. Sci. A, Polym. Chem., 35, 1499 (1997)). The photochemically reduced PTFE films were subsequently modified by photograft polymerization of acrylic acid, acrylamide, and poly(ethylene glycol) monoacrylate (PEG-Ac) by employing long wavelength UV irradiation with benzil dimethyl ketal as an initiator. The photochemically reduced PTFE films were good substrates for photograft polymerization, leading to surfaces with chemical compositions close to those of the respective homopolymers as determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Photograft polymerization of PEG-Ac on the photochemically reduced surface was also explored with different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8%; v/v) and molecular weights (200, 400, 1000, and 2000 g/mol) of PEG-Ac, different durations (5, 10, and 20 min) of long wavelength UV irradiation, and different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8%; v/v) of benzil dimethyl ketal. Higher concentrations and lower molecular weights of PEG-Ac generally led to more extensive photo raft polymerization, whereas the concentration of benzil dimethyl ketal and duration of UV irradiation did not substantially influence the extent of photograft polymerization.

J,"Deming, TJ",,,,"Deming, TJ",,,Facile synthesis of block copolypeptides of defined architecture,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ANHYDRIDES; ACID,"Many natural polymeric materials (particularly structural proteins) display a hierarchy of structure over several length scales. Block copolymers are able to self-assemble into ordered nanostructures(1,2), but the random-coiled nature of their polymer chains usually suppresses any further levels of organization. The use of components with regular structures, such as rigid-rod polymers, can increase the extent of spatial organization in self-assembling materials(3). But the synthesis of such polymeric components typically involves complicated reaction steps that are not suitable for large-scale production. Proteins form hierarchically organized structures in which the fundamental motifs are generally alpha-helical coils and beta-sheets(4). Attempts to synthesize polypeptides with well-defined amino-acid sequences, which might adopt similar organized structures, have been plagued by unwanted side reactions(5) that give rise to products with a wide range of molecular weights(6-10), hampering the formation of well-defined peptide block copolymers(11-17). Here I describe a polymerization strategy that overcomes these difficulties by using organonickel initiators which suppress chain-transfer and termination side reactions. This approach allows the facile synthesis of block copolypeptides with well-defined sequences, which might provide new peptide-based biomaterials with potential applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and biomimetic composite formation.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT CHEM,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106","Deming, TJ (reprint author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT MAT,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106, USA.",,"Deming, Timothy/I-5411-2013","Deming, Timothy/0000-0002-0594-5025",,,,25,450,456,1,173,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,NOV 27,1997.0,390,6658,,,,,386,389,,10.1038/37084,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,YH549,WOS:A1997YH54900058,9389476.0,,,,2019-02-25

Microparticles were not formed in the absence of protein. Instead, the phase containing starch separated after agglomeration. Thus, stabilization/hydrophobization of the starch surface by silicone alone was not possible. However, there is a strong affinity between the silicone and the protein particularly in the case of the PDMS-TES and, simultaneously, an affinity between the PDMS-TES and the starch that leads to a stabilization of the starch surface. This could most clearly be seen from immunological data that showed that antibodies were elicited by protein in the microparticles coated with PDMS-TES following oral administration.","MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT PATHOL, HAMILTON, ON L8N 3Z5, CANADA","Brook, MA (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT CHEM, 1280 MAIN ST W, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4M1, CANADA.",,,,,,,75,11,11,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,NOV 12,1997.0,13,23,,,,,6279,6286,,10.1021/la970419b,,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,YG702,WOS:A1997YG70200044,,,,,2019-02-25

This literature review examines these lenses from both a basic science and a clinical perspective. By most parameters, hydrogel, soft acrylic and silicone IOL are better than polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses. Plate haptic silicone IOL have the lowest incidence of cystoid macula oedema and posterior capsule opacification, but these lenses require an intact anterior capsularhexis and posterior capsule. Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy must be delayed at least 3 months to avoid posterior lens dislocation. Silicone has the lowest threshold for YAG laser damage of all IOL materials and also adheres irreversibly to silicone oil with subsequent optical impairment. Three piece silicone IOL with polypropylene haptics have a higher incidence of decentration, pigment adherence and capsule opacification compared with PMMA haptics. Hydrogel lenses are very biocompatible and resistant to YAG laser damage, but pigment adheres to the surface more readily than PMMA. Soft acrylic IOL unfold slowly, resulting in controlled insertion, but it is possible to crack the lens and some lenses develop glistenings due to water accumulation. There are significant socioeconomic implications to the large differences in posterior capsule opacification rates between the various biomaterials and the lens styles.","CHRISTCHURCH HOSP,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,CHRISTCHURCH,NEW ZEALAND",,,,,,,,77,58,63,2,33,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN COLL OPHTHAL,SYDNEY,"27 COMMONWEALTH ST, SYDNEY NSW 2010, AUSTRALIA",0814-9763,,,AUST NZ J OPHTHALMOL,Aust.

The activity of immobilized hirudin on the polymer was estimated by a chromogenic assay to about 2.5 ATU r-Hir cm(-2). The improvement of the haemocompatibility of the modified RG756 was evaluated in terms of platelet adhesion/activation, whole blood clotting times and clot formation rate. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that surface modification with r-Hir resulted in decreased platelet adhesion and activation. An ELISA for P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, was used to confirm this result. Clotting time experiments demonstrated significantly prolonged non-activated partial thromboplastin times, and a decreased clot formation rate of whole blood in contact with r-Hir modified RG756 compared with the plain polymer. Comparison of immobilized r-Hir with bound heparin yielded equivalent improvement of blood-contacting properties of the investigated polymers.

This study followed 20 screw-shaped dental implants placed in edentulated (2 months' healing time) posterior jaws of five adult female baboons. Implants made of three biomaterials were placed and allowed to heal for 3 months prior to processing for evaluation. Percentage integration and bone area data from six horizontal sections along the entire length of each implant were collected and analyzed for differences between jaws, implant biomaterials, jaw/biomaterial, and sections of the implants (ANOVA, pairwise comparison using LSM with Bonferroni adjustment). The results indicated that overall mean percentage integration was 46.5 and mean percentage bone area was 39.9. Maxillary and mandibular differences for both parameters were statistically different (integration: maxillary = 38.1%, mandibular = 56.7%; bone area: maxillary = 35.8%, mandibular = 44.9%; both were significant at the P < .05 level). The biomaterial analyses revealed significant differences for percentage integration between the metal implants and the hydroxyapatite-coated implant (commercially pure titanium = 39.1%, titanium-aluminum-vanadium = 40.0%, hydroxyapatite-coated = 61.5%), but no such difference was noted for percentage bone area (commercially pure titanium = 38.8%, titanium-aluminum-vanadium = 38.9%, hydroxyapatite-coated = 42.3%). Discussion of the relative importance of the two parameters highlights the fact that resistance to functional loads requires establishing and then maintaining an adequate volume of bone, which may have a functionally specific structure based on the mechanical properties of the local jaw environment.","UNIV TENNESSEE, MED CTR, KNOXVILLE, TN USA","Carr, AB (reprint author), OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, 305 W 12TH AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.",,,"Carr, Alan/0000-0002-7944-4143",,,,28,18,19,0,1,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

We report that circulating microparticle levels were dependent on test segment material, length, and time. The connection of 50-cm lengths of PVA hydrogel test segments led to MP levels two to three times greater than background at 48 h, while the connection of polyethylene test segments did not lead to elevated microparticle levels. MP levels were near background 24 h after removal of the PVA test segment.

In particular, air-plasma treatment and Ce(IV)-induced hydroxyethylmethacrylate grafting, two typical reactions of biomedical polymers surface chemistry, were used to improve cell adhesion or to impart cell resistance to the plasma-coated Ti.

Operational stability, or retention of biological activity, of biochemically modified biomaterials is a fundamental determinant of their usefulness. The present study investigated retention of enzymatic activity immobilized on silanized Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. A model enzyme, trypsin, was immobilized on monolayers and multilayers of silane deposited from aqueous or organic solutions of gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS). Trypsin-conjugated biomaterials were incubated in cell culture medium at 37 degrees C for up to 96 h, and the residual immobilized activity was measured. Retention of bioactivity in physiological saline was dependent on the type of material and on the method of silanization. Activity of enzyme adsorbed on the metals was lost within 24-48 h. Both mono-and multilayers of APS deposited on Co-Cr-Mo by aqueous silanization effectively retained enzymatic activity throughout the 96 h incubation period. The monolayer retained approximately 23% of the activity initially present, and the multilayers retained approximately 50% of the initial activity. Organic silanization of Co-Cr-Mo was marginally effective as it initially slowed the loss of activity. However, all activity was lost by 48-72 h of incubation. Neither organic nor aqueous silanization enhanced retention of enzymatic activity on Ti-6Al-4V.

A photochemical method is presented to couple phosphorylcholine-containing aryl azides to poly(etherurethane) surfaces (PEUs). Two aryl azides that consist of a photoactivatable 4-azidobenzoyl group, a short spacer chain, and a phosphorylcholine endgroup were synthesized. The two compounds differ only in the type of spacer used: triethylene glycol for compound 1 and hexanediol for compound 2. These compounds were physically adsorbed to PEU surfaces. Upon UV irradiation, reactive intermediates are formed that react with nucleophilic groups on the polymer surface. The modified surfaces showed decreased underwater contact angles, indicating that hydrophilic phosphorylcholine groups are present at the surface. ESCA measurements showed the presence of phosphorus and positively charged nitrogen atoms in the outermost polymer layers (analyzed depth about 50 Angstrom), which is a strong indication of the presence of phosphorylcholine groups. Hemocompatibility in vitro was tested with thrombin generation assays and platelet adhesion tests. In thrombin generation assays the clotting time of platelet-rich plasma in contact with the polymer surface is determined. Clotting times were clearly prolonged for the modified surfaces. Surfaces modified with compound 2 showed slightly higher clotting times than those modified with compound 1. Repeated surface modification with compound 2 further increased the clotting time. For the tested surfaces an increase in the clotting time corresponds to an increase in the concentration of phosphorylcholine groups at the surface (as measured by ESCA and contact angle). Platelet adhesion studies with scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that fewer platelets (showing less activation) adhered to the modified surfaces than to the unmodified polyurethane.

These quantitative differences were supported by LM and ultrastructural observations of the interface.

Mechanical properties were determined using tensile testing and dynamic mechanical analysis, whereas resistance to encrustation was examined using an in vitro model for encrustation simulating in vivo encrustation. Maximum and minimum tensile strength at break, Young's modulus, storage and loss moduli were associated with PMMA and PU, respectively. IPNs demonstrated intermediate mechanical properties which were dependent on the concentrations of the component polymers. Conversely, maximum elongation at break was observed for PU and this parameter decreased as the concentration of PMMA increased in the IPN. The dynamic mechanical damping parameter, tan delta, was similar for all IPNs at 37 degrees C. Increased advancing and decreased receding contact angles were observed for IPNs in comparison with the native PU. The rate and extent of encrustation, measured as the percentage surface coverage, was similar for PU, IPNs and PMMA. In contrast, encrustation on polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, a model hydrogel, was greater than observed for the IPNs or component polymers. No apparent correlation was observed between the rate and/or extent of encrustation and polymer contact angle. It is concluded that these IPNs may be of clinical benefit in patients providing stent resistance to extrinsic compression of the ureter in comparison with native PU. The comparable resistance to encrustation between the IPNs and PU indicates:that the use of IPNs should not be restricted in this regard.","UNIV ULSTER, SCH ELECT & MECH ENGN, NEWTOWNABBEY BT37 0QB, NORTH IRELAND; BELFAST CITY HOSP, DEPT UROL, BELFAST BT9 7BL, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND","Jones, DS (reprint author), QUEENS UNIV BELFAST, CTR MED BIOL, SCH PHARM, BELFAST BT9 7BL, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND.",,,,,,,23,29,30,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

These materials have been developed for use as polymer scaffolds in tissue engineering, which have cell-adhesion resistant, ligand-immobilizable, and biodegradable characteristics. The GL-PEG cross-linked polymer networks obtained were glassy and transparent, and the gel content was approximately 90%, irrespective of the degree of polymerization of lactide on the glycerol center and the amount and molecular weight of the PEG acrylate incorporated. All networks showed relatively low swelling in water, due to their highly cross-linked nature. They had no melting endotherms, but they displayed glass transition temperatures indicative of phase-mixing of the PEG. Analysis by ESCA, contact angle measurement, and cell culture indicated the presence of PEG at the network surfaces and showed that higher molecular weight PEG was incorporated into the network surfaces to a higher extent, rendered the surfaces more hydrophilic, and repelled cell adhesion more effectively than did PEG of lower molecular weights. All GL networks showed much less adhesion and spreading of human foreskin fibroblasts than glass used as a control: In particular, GL-PEG networks were highly resistant to cell adhesion due to the mobile PEG chains. Given that the terminal hydroxyl function on the incorporated PEG can be readily derivatized with a bioactive peptide, these degradable networks should be useful as polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering.","ETH ZURICH, INST BIOMED ENGN, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND; UNIV ZURICH, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND; ETH ZURICH, DEPT MAT, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND; CALTECH, DIV CHEM & CHEM ENGN, PASADENA, CA 91125 USA; KOREA INST SCI & TECHNOL, BIOMAT RES CTR, SEOUL 130650, SOUTH KOREA",,,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456; Han, Dong Keun/0000-0003-4641-7883",,,,42,147,155,2,47,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,OCT 6,1997.0,30,20,,,,,6077,6083,,10.1021/ma970302u,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,YA289,WOS:A1997YA28900015,,,,,2019-02-25

The volumetric and mechanical properties were assessed with a three-dimensional modeling of Pebax sacs and computerized simulations of their systolic distortions for both right and left ventricular configurations. The stresses and strains of these sacs were represented as quantitative mappings for a maximum end-systolic state and were below the respective threshold values above which the Pebau material is jeopardized for permanent structure impairment. After fatigue tests applied on Pebau strips under the alleged working conditions of Pebax sacs, the material structure was unchanged and maintained its intrinsic mechanical properties. The theoretical maximum stroke volumes were 74.4 cm(3) and 62.4 cm(3) for the left and right ventricular configurations, respectively. With these mechanical and volumetric features, the biomechanical double sac concept was considered valid and could be provided for a consequent specific total artificial heart.","ELF ATOCHEM,CTR ETUD RECH & DEV,SERQUIGNY,FRANCE","Chatel, D (reprint author), HOP BICHAT,SERV CHIRURG CARDIOVASC,DEPT CHIRURG CARDIAQUE,46 RUE HENRI HUCHARD,F-75018 PARIS,FRANCE.",,,,,,,20,0,0,1,5,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

This experimental system is important in understanding mineralization in ordered organic media, a phenomenon of importance in biology and possibly in biomaterials technology as well. The first step in the process involves the doping of a mesophase with precursor ions for the mineral phase with little disruption of the order parameter. Growth of the mineral crystals is then induced by establishing interfacial contact between mesophases doped with different precursor ions. In the system studied here, mineralization occurs at the interface as a result of diffusion of calcium and phosphate ions toward regions of lower concentration. Characterization of the precipitate formed at the interface by X-ray as well as electron diffraction, elemental analysis, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy has revealed the formation of single crystals of brushite (CaHPO4.2H(2)O) with triangular and platelike morphology. Most importantly, these crystals exhibited longitudinal striations on their surface which are believed to be due a templating effect from the liquid-crystalline phase. The striations are most likely an imprint of the preferred orientation of cylindrical molecular assemblies in the hexagonal mesophase.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CHEM,MAT RES LAB,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,MAT RES LAB,URBANA,IL 61801",,,"Stupp, Samuel/B-6737-2009",,,,,29,8,11,1,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Development of a novel biodurable polyurethane surface to which biological agents, such as growth factors or anticoagulants could be covalently bound, would be beneficial. The purpose of this study was to synthesize a novel poly(carbonate urea) urethane polymer with carboxylic acid groups which would serve as ''anchor'' sites for protein attachment. Physical characteristics such as tensile strength, initial modulus, ultimate elongation, tear strength, water/alcohol uptake and water vapor permeation were then evaluated and compared to other biomedical-grade polyurethanes. Covalent linkage of the blood protein albumin to this novel surface was then examined. A biodurable polycarbonate-based polyurethane containing carboxylic acid groups (cPU) was synthesized using a two step procedure incorporating the chain extender 2,2-bis (hydroxymethyl)-propionic acid (DHMPA). Tensile strength of this cPU film was 2.7 and 2.6 fold greater than both a polycarbonate-based polyurethane synthesized with a 1,4-butanediol chain extender (bdPU) and Mitrathane (Mit) controls, respectively. The cPU polymer also possessed 7.8 and 31 fold greater structural rigidity upon evaluation of initial modulus as compared to the bdPU and Mit, respectively. Ultimate elongation for the bdPU films was slightly higher than the cPU and Mit films, which had comparable elongation properties. The force required to tear the bdPU film was 1.9 and 32 fold greater than the cPU and Mit films, respectively. Alcohol solution uptake by all of the polyurethane segments increased with increasing alcohol concentrations, with the cPU having the greatest uptake. Water uptake was minimal for all the polyurethanes examined and was not affected by altering pH. Water vapor permeation was lowest for the cPU films as compared to both bdPU and Mit. Swelling the cPU in 50% ethanol prior to evaluation slightly increased water vapor permeation through the films. Covalent linkage of the radiolabelled blood protein albumin (I-125-BSA) to the cPU segments incubated with the heterobifunctional crosslinker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was greatest in the higher percent of ethanol as compared to controls.

Our results showed good biological tolerance of both prostheses and a high degree of adhesion formation in Marlex implants. In animals with Dual Mesh(R) implants, only loose adhesions were seen. Marlex implants induced the presence of disorganized scar tissue, while the Dual Mesh prostheses were encapsulated by organized tissue. The macrophage response was similar in both decreasing with time. The resistance to traction was higher when the reparation was done with polypropylene.

This study examined the adherence of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis to commercially available polyurethane and silicone peritoneal catheters in the presence and absence of a proteinaceous conditioning film. In addition, the effects of the conditioning film on the surface properties (advancing and receding contact angles, and surface rugosity) of these biomaterials were investigated. Bacterial adherence to polyurethane and silicone catheters, pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or artificial spent peritoneal dialysate (ASD) for 1 h at 37 degrees C, was examined using a radiometric (2-H-3-adenine) adherence assay. The advancing and receding contact angles and the surface rugosity of ASD- and PBS-treated biomaterials were examined using a dynamic contact angle analyser and an atomic force microscope, respectively. The bacterial isolates were selected to represent high and low cell surface hydrophobicity. The hydrophobic isolate exhibited both a significantly greater rate and a significantly greater extent of adherence than the hydrophilic isolate to both catheter materials, independent of pre-treatment. In general, pre-treatment of the catheter materials with ASD significantly decreased the subsequent adherence of both isolates owing to the deposition of a conditioning film on the surface of the biomaterial. ASD treatment also decreased both the advancing and receding contact angles and the surface rugosity of both catheter materials. This study highlights the influence of both bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and biomaterial surface conditioning films on bacterial adherence to CAPD catheters.

Biomaterials often show adsorption of fibrinogen and subsequent formation of fibrin. Plasminogen's function in vivo could be adapted to facilitate its activation and fibrinolytic function on a biomaterial surface. In order to elucidate plasminogen function adsorbed to a model fibrinolytic surface ligands known to affect plasminogen properties in solution were attached to model silica surfaces to study the effects of immobilized ligands as fibrinolytic activators. Model silica surfaces were synthesized which contained covalently attached lysine moieties (surface I), sulfonate moieties (surface II) or a combination of both (surface III). Lysine moieties on these model surfaces interact specifically with multiple lysine binding sites of plasminogen and induce a number of changes in conformation and function. Sulfonate moieties interact non-specifically with accessible lysine and arginine residues of plasminogen and also affect the function of plasminogen. Inherent physico-chemical properties monitored following plasminogen adsorption were activation to plasmin, enzymatic activity, fluorescent intensity, and fluorescent polarization, monitored br total internal reflection fluorescence, each of which are affected by plasminogen conformation. Correlations were as follows: increased fluorescent intensity and decreased fluorescent polarization were indicative of plasminogen conformational changes and are correlated to increased enzymatic activity of plasmin. Surfaces I and III showed a 20% increase in fluorescent intensity, and a 25% and 8% decrease in fluorescent polarization, respectively, in comparison to surface II. The specific activity for surfaces I and III was increased 11.3 and 1.8 fold above that found for surface II. Plasminogen incubated with sulfonate groups in solution resulted in no increase in fluorescent intensity and a slight decrease in fluorescent polarization as compared with plasminogen alone and reduced specific activity of plasmin in the presence of sulfonate as compared with plasmin alone. Lysine or E-aminocaproic acid (ACA) incubated with plasmin in solution showed a 30% and 10% increase in fluorescent intensity, a 24% and 5% decrease in fluorescent intensity, and maximum specific activity increased 3.6 and 2.5 fold, respectively, over plasminogen alone. Interactions of plasminogen with ligands for its lysine-binding sites produced dramatic effects both in solution and adsorbed to model fibrinolytic surfaces. The characterization of these interactions along with known fibrin interactions will allow selection of appropriate surface modifications to enhance the fibrinolysis of thrombus formed at a biomaterial interface. These modifications may lead to a native-like surface structure to protein and cellular components of blood and create a more biocompatible surface.

The use of these methods can provide information on the biodegradation product profiles and yield concentration levels for the isolated products. The latter information is required to assess the toxicological nature of biomaterials and their related degradation products. In this study a model biomedical polyurethane was synthesized with toluene diisocyanate, polyester diol and ethylene diamine, and then incubated at 37 degrees C in a biological solution containing enzyme. The biodegradation products were isolated from the in vitro system and prepared for HPLC analysis, by using a combination of ultrafiltration, freeze drying and liquid-solid extraction. The ultrafiltration and the liquid-solid extraction effectively removed protein contamination. The separation of more than 20 degradation products, with gradient HPLC, was optimized using a photodiode array detector. The separated degradation products were identified using a tandem mass spectrometer. The model polyurethane was labeled with C-14 in different segments, in order to assist in confirming the efficiency of the sample preparation and isolation methods. A detection limit of 2 ng was found. No toluene diamine - a suspected human carcinogen associated with some medical implants - could be found in the test samples. This represents a significant finding since the amount of this injected sample actually contained a total of 28 mu g of degradation products isolated from the incubation medium.

In the limit of a perfectly smooth hydroxyapatite (HA) surface, a tensile test of the bone-HA interface affords an opportunity to isolate the bonding contribution related to HA surface chemistry alone. This study measured the bone-HA interfacial tensile strength for highly polished (similar to 0.05 mu m alumina) dense HA disks (5.25 mm in diameter, 1.3 in mm thickness) in rabbit tibiae. Each of five rabbits received four HA disks, two per proximal tibia. Pull-off loads ranged from 3.14 +/- 2.38N at 55 days after implantation to 18.35 +/- 11.9N at 88 days; nominal interfacial tensile strengths were 0.15 +/- 0.11 MPa and 0.85 +/- 0.55 MPa, respectively. SEM of failed interfaces revealed failures between HA and bone, within the HA itself and within adjacent bone. Tissue remnants on HA were identified as mineralized bone with either a lamellar or trabecular structure. Oriented collagen fibers in the bone intricately interdigitated with the HA surface, which frequently showed breakdown at material grain boundaries and a rougher surface than originally implanted. Mechanical interlocking could not be eliminated as a mode of tissue attachment and contribution to bone-HA bonding, even after implanting an extremely smooth HA surface.

Under optimal conditions, the shrinkage temperature (T-s) was raised to 74 degrees C for collagen crosslinked with DMS and to 80 degrees C for those crosslinked with GTA. Crosslinking density measurements were done on the hydrothermally denatured collagen by the method based on the Flory-Rehner equation. GTA treatment was found to introduce more number of crosslinks than DMS. The maximum tension attained during heating (after shrinkage has occurred) was greater for GTA-treated collagen than for DMS and control. The control collagen membranes broke during heating (at 73 degrees C), while for the crosslinked membranes the tension kept on increasing up to 100 degrees C. The crosslinking density correlated well with the data determined from the in vitro and in vivo degradation studies. Uncrosslinked and DMS crosslinked collagen membranes were more susceptible to degradation by enzymes in vitro, while GTA-treated collagen was highly resistant to degradation. The biocompatibility of the collagen membranes was studied by subcutaneous implantation in rats. Uncrosslinked collagen membranes degraded within 14 days with the formation of granulation tissue. DMS crosslinked membranes degraded within 21 days and the area was replaced by numerous fibroblasts and newly formed collagen. No calcification was observed. For GTA-treated membranes, necrosis was observed after 7 days implantation and by 14 days the membrane had started to calcify.

A series of five polyurethanes were made from the macrodiols poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG), poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO), poly (hexamethylene oxide) (PHMO), poly(octamethylene oxide) (POMO), and poly(decamethylene oxide) (PDMO). In the sequence the macrodiols become less polar and phase separation in the polymer increases, creating a range of hydrophilicity. These five polyurethanes were studied along with commercial Pellethane 2363-80A. The materials were implanted intramuscularly into rats for 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months. The inflammatory response was analyzed using a combination of immunohistochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and image analysis to determine the specific cell types involved in the response and to quantify these cellular responses. The presence of three cytokines also was investigated. The cell types targeted were neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T and B lymphocytes. The cytokines target were tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). All samples were positive for macrophages and activated macrophages, TNF alpha, and MCP-1, and negative for all other antibodies. The response was sustained throughout the implantation period with no significant difference among the samples except at the 7-day time point. The study demonstrated an absence of lymphocytes and neutrophils in a response that was sustained in terms of macrophages with the presence of TNF alpha and MCP-1 and the absence of IL-6. The position of subsets of macrophages with respect to increasing distance from the implants was demonstrated to be significant and consistent within this series of polyurethanes.

Human skin is chosen as an example of living tissue. The cells suitable for the measurement of various layers of human skin and calculation procedures for the waveform reflected from the probe end are described. The approach was confirmed to be effective for the determination of the water content through measurement of the standard samples, keratin-water mixtures. This method was also applied to human skin in vivo. Water content data measured with a probe specially designed for surface layer analysis were sensitive to humidity around the subject. The formula expressing the relation between the electrical field character of the probe, the permittivity depth profile, and the measured permittivity was used to analyze the water content profile as a function of the depth from the skin surface. The use of several kinds of probes, differing in their electric field characteristics, permitted evaluation of the water content depth profile of human skin. This procedure is easy and applicable to any sample due to its simplicity. The measurement needs only a touch of the probe on a sample spot. It is therefore a promising method of physicochemical research on living organisms and biomaterials.

This centrifugal pump has been developed as a completely sealless pump for long-term usage. The combination of Al2O3 and UHMWPE are the materials of choice for the acetabular bearing in artificial joints, which have proven to be clinically reliable for over 10 years. Previous studies have examined the biocompatibility of Al2O3 and UHMWPE as bulky implant materials. The present study investigated this material as a blood-contacting material using a standard assessment in vitro and in vivo analysis. The examined items were systemic toxicity, sensitization (guinea pig maximization test), cytotoxicity (elution test), mutagenicity (Ames test), direct contact hemolysis, and thrombogenicity. The studies were performed according to the United States Pharmacopoeia and published previous studies. The samples of both Al2O3 and UHMWPE demonstrated no differences from the negative controls in all tests. These findings indicate that both Al2O3 and UHMWPE are biocompatible materials for double-pivot bearings in the centrifugal blood pump.

The abilities of these three materials to stimulate alveolar macrophages were compared. Non-treated and lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages were used as control. The level of macrophage activation was determined by nitrite and prostaglandin E-2 assay and respiratory burst measurement by chemiluminescence. The results of these studies showed different macrophage responses to these three relatively similar stimuli. Two of the studied materials were shown to be potent activators of respiratory burst and prostaglandin E-2 secretion without any significant release of nitric oxide.

The purpose of this study was to measure reverse-torque failure after 6 months of healing for three different biomaterials in the posterior jaws of four adult female baboons. The animals had all of their posterior teeth surgically extracted and, following 10 weeks of healing, 7 implants were placed in each quadrant. The biomaterials included titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces, titanium-aluminum-vanadium surfaces (both 3.8 mm x 10 mm), and a commercially pure titanium surface (3.75 mm x 10 mm). After 6 months, torque data were collected using a counterclockwise computerized torque driver and were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance for differences related to biomaterial, jaw and biomaterial/jaw. Post-hoc Tukey Kramer analysis was also performed for within-group differences (alpha = .05 level). The biomaterial comparison revealed a significant difference between the titanium plasma-sprayed and the combined commercially pure titanium/titanium-aluminum-vanadium groups (analysis of variance, Tukey Kramer, P < .05). The jaw comparison showed no significant difference, although the data suggest that higher forces may be required for mandibular torsional failure. The biomaterial/jaw comparison revealed that jaw differences for the mean values of commercially pure titanium and titanium-aluminum-vanadium implants were greater than jaw differences for mean values of titanium plasma-sprayed implants, although these differences were not statistically significant. Because of the lack of correlation between single-cycle biomechanical tests and clinical performance, it is necessary to be selective in assigning usefulness to data of this type.","OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, SECT ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA; OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, SECT ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA","Carr, AB (reprint author), OHIO STATE UNIV, COLL DENT, SECT RESTORAT DENT PROSTHODONT & ENDODONT DENT, 305 W 12TH AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.",,,"Carr, Alan/0000-0002-7944-4143",,,,23,18,19,0,4,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

The subjects of this review are the materials, and to a lesser extent, the design aspects of the numerous implants that are available to the surgeon in dealing with the ailing spine. Often it is the material aspects of such devices that are responsible for their success or failure. It may be that osteoconductive properties are desired for implants to assist fusion, whereas as inert a material as possible would be preferred for interpositional barriers. The materials composing the instrumentation used to facilitate healing of spinal fractures would ideally have properties that optimize strength and biocompatibility, while at the same time minimizing imaging artifacts and allowing a gradual transfer of load from the instrumentation to the vertebral body (i.e., viscoelastic effects). The application of biomaterials and biomechanics to the design of spinal devices is obvious; what may be more subtle though is what the in vivo interactions of these will be. The study of such aspects must continue in order to better evolve the designs and subsequent results of implanted spinal devices. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

It has been stated that the multinucleated cells which contain wear particles are not bone-resorbing osteoclasts. To investigate the validity of this claim we isolated human osteoclasts from giant-cell tumours of bone and rat osteoclasts from long bones. These were cultured on glass coverslips and on cortical bone slices in the presence of particles of latex, PMMA and titanium. Osteoclast phagocytosis of these particle types was shown by light microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and SEM. Giant cells containing phagocytosed particles were seen to be associated with the formation of resorption lacunae. Osteoclasts containing particles were also calcitonin-receptor-positive and showed an inhibitory response to calcitonin. Our findings demonstrate that osteoclasts are capable of phagocytosing particles of a wide range of size, including particles of polymeric and metallic biomaterials found in periprosthetic tissues, and that after particle phagocytosis, they remain fully functional, hormone-responsive, bone-resorbing cells.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND",,,"Simpson, Alasdair/F-1887-2013","Simpson, Alasdair/0000-0001-7793-642X; Ferguson, David/0000-0001-5045-819X",,,,34,73,73,0,2,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",0301-620X,2044-5377,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

In biological systems, this tool is often used to create microstructures in which the organic manipulators are a minority component. Three groups of materials-biomaterials, ceramics, and semiconductors-have been selected to illustrate this concept as used by nature and by synthetic laboratories exploring its potential in materials technology. In some of nature's biomaterials, macromolecules such as proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides are used to control nucleation and growth of mineral phases and thus manipulate microstructure and physical properties. This concept has been used synthetically to generate apatite-based materials that can function as artificial bone in humans. Synthetic polymers and surfactants can also drastically change the morphology of ceramic particles, impart new functional properties, and provide new processing methods for the formation of useful objects. Interesting opportunities also exist in creating semiconducting materials in which molecular manipulators connect quantum dots or template cavities, which change their electronic properties and functionality.","UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,MAT RES LAB,DEPT CHEM,URBANA,IL 61801","Stupp, SI (reprint author), UNIV ILLINOIS,BECKMAN INST ADV SCI & TECHNOL,MAT RES LAB,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,1304 W GREEN ST,URBANA,IL 61801, USA.",,"Stupp, Samuel/B-6737-2009",,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE 05945],,,63,705,738,9,209,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,AUG 29,1997.0,277,5330,,,,,1242,1248,,10.1126/science.277.5330.1242,,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,XT827,WOS:A1997XT82700034,9271562.0,,,,2019-02-25

Due to their large geometrical aspect ratios, they are well suited for use as biomolecular templates for the fabrication of magnetic and electrically conductive nanowires. Three-dimensional metallization of these MTs is demonstrated by an electroless deposition technique of nickel initiated by molecular palladium catalysts. In this study of the deposition conditions, it is shown that in the use of electroless plating for the metallization of tubulin assemblies the process parameters, such as temperature and pH, need to be adjusted to the chemical conditions of the in-vitro self-assembly process of MTs. The activated and metallized MTs have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the distribution of the Pd catalyst particles after MT activation, we found that a minimum nickel thickness of about 10 nm is required to produce a continuous film.

At low compressive loads, the forces were repulsive, but they became attractive when the proteins were pressed into the polymer layer at higher loads, The adhesion was sufficiently robust that separation of the streptavidin and PEG uprooted anchored polymer from the supporting membrane. These interactions altered the properties of the grafted chains, After the onset of the attraction, the polymer continued to bind protein for several hours, The changes were not due to protein denaturation. These data demonstrate directly that the biological activity of PEG is not due solely to properties of simple polymers such as the excluded volume, It is also coupled to the competitive interactions between solvent and other materials such as proteins for the chain segments and to the ability of this material to adopt higher order intrachain structures.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801",,,,,,,,55,208,209,2,55,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The material, resembling common silicone rubber, is hydrophilic and swells in water like hydrogels. The polyacrylamide has a high specific surface area, a relatively low content of water-soluble low-molecular-weight compounds and, owing to its non-ionogenic character, a pH-independent swelling degree. For the composite material consisting of the silicone rubber and very fine powdery cross-linked polyacrylamide, we have measured the rate of swelling in water, the mechanical properties (tensile strength, break elongation, hardness, resilience), biological properties (implantation test, cytotoxicity, cell cultivation) and UV absorption of its water extracts. The polyacrylamide and polysiloxane purity, as the composite material starting components, has been determined to be satisfactory. As a result, a high swelling rate of the prepared composite material has been observed, resulting in reaching more than 70% wt of water of the equilibrium swelling.

To study the distribution of chromium in mice organs with time, several animals were subcutaneously injected with 2.70 x 10(-3) mol/L of chromium solution during a certain period of time. Square wave voltammetry using adsorptive collection of Cr3+-DTPA complex on a mercury film microelectrode (MFM) was used for quantitation. Optimized conditions included DTPA concentration of 2.0 x 10(-2) mol/L, sodium acetate 4.0 x 10(-2) mol/L, sodium nitrate 0.40 mol/L, potassium permanganate 1.0 x 10(-3) mol/L, pH ca. 6.1, deposition potential of -1.15 V, deposition time 20 s, frequency 100 Hz, step 2.5 mV and an amplitude of 20 mV. The detection limit of the method was 1.54 x 10(-8) mol/L after deposition of 20 s. Other species presented in the biological material such as calcium and iron do not interfere with the chromium determinations. The accuracy of the proposed method was checked by comparing the results with those obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) yielding good agreement. The results showed an increase of chromium levels with time in liver, kidney and spleen, indicating that this metal is partially accumulated in the studied organs.","UNIV AVEIRO, DEPT BIOL, P-3810 AVEIRO, PORTUGAL","Pereira, MC (reprint author), UNIV PORTO, DEPT ENGN QUIM, INST BIOMED ENGN, FAC ENGN, PRACA CORONEL PACHECO 1, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL.",,"Pereira, Maria/S-6624-2016","Pereira, Maria/0000-0001-8505-3432; Pereira, Maria de Lourdes/0000-0001-6703-7869; Sousa, Joao/0000-0002-8269-9390",,,,26,27,27,0,7,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1040-0397,,,ELECTROANAL,Electroanalysis,AUG,1997.0,9,12,,,,,941,944,,10.1002/elan.1140091215,,,,4,"Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry",Chemistry; Electrochemistry,YB188,WOS:A1997YB18800011,,,,,2019-02-25

This study evaluates metallic, ceramic, and bioabsorbable facial reconstruction materials for their differential effects on radiation dosimetry. Methods. Commercially pure titanium (cpt), stainless steel (steel), titanium alloy (tia), hydroxyapatite (HA), acid poly-L-lactide (PLA, a bioabsorbable polymer) were obtained for this study. The radiation doses distal (behind) and proximal (in front of) to the test material were measured with an ionization chamber placed at several distances from the test material. Therefore, transmission (proximal to plate) and backscattering (distal to plate) factors were generated at several distances for each material. Results. Poly-L-lactide transmitted nearly 100% of the incident radiation beam. The metals had the greatest effect on transmission with steel, followed by cpt, tia, and HA showing the greatest reduction of incident beam. Poly-L-lactide revealed minimal backscattering. Greater backscatter of the incident radiation beam was seen from steel, followed by cpt and HA, Poly-L-lactide also behaved similar to water in transmission and backscatters properties during electron irradiation. Conclusions. Poly-L-lactide has a minimal effect on the radiation-dose distribution and may be beneficial as a reconstructive device for patients undergoing head and neck cancer radiotherapy. Hydroxyapatite showed a relatively minor effect, whereas the metals (steel, followed by opt and tia) revealed the greatest detrimental effect on the radiation-dose distribution.

This phenomenon is potentially important to dental alloys which are adjacent to oral tissues. To help define the mechanisms by which Ni causes an infiltration of inflammatory cells, we exposed endothelial cells in vitro to Ni ions and measured the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 is known to be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells from the bloodstream. We also exposed macrophages to Ni ions to test the hypothesis that Ni might alter cytokine secretion and subsequently cause expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. The results showed that Ni ions could promote the expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells, but only at concentrations which were high enough (850 mu mol/L for 24 h) to suppress cell metabolic activity. Although we had previous evidence that Ni could cause macrophages to secrete cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta, Ni-exposed macrophage supernatants did not induce expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells at concentrations subtoxic to the macrophages (85 mu mol/L). At subtoxic concentrations, Ni ions were able to suppress ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells which were stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide. Thus, Ni ions either promoted or suppressed the expression of ICAM-1 depending on their concentration. This dual action of Ni ions may be important in vivo where a gradient of concentrations of released ions is Likely to exist around the implanted biomaterial. Further studies are necessary to determine the effect of time of exposure and the molecular mechanisms of increased ICAM-1 expression.

The dynamic compaction method recently was developed to consolidate drug-loaded calcium phosphate powder without a sintering step. Zn the present work, human recombinant growth hormone was loaded on biphasic calcium phosphate powder and consolidated by a specific process of cold sintering (dynamic compaction). Analyses of the biocompatibility of compacted pellets (mouse L929 fibroblastic cell culture) and the bioactivity of the drugs released by them (growth hormone bioassay) were performed. This report demonstrates the biocompatibility of the compacts prepared by dynamic compaction. L929 cell proliferation was maintained and the capacity to secrete fibronectin was conserved in the presence of compacted materials. Comparison of released growth hormone integrity, revealed by radioimmunoassay and eluted stain bioassay, has shown that the biological activity of growth hormone was totally preserved after dynamic compaction. However, 35% of loaded growth hormone was not released in our experimental conditions, probably because of the inaccessibility of growth hormone within the granulated compacts. Dynamic compaction shows good potential for the production of biomaterials capable of releasing therapeutic agents in situ.

Titanium alloy implants with and without a hydroxyapatite coating were used as positive and negative controls, and these were implanted with a circumferential gap of one millimeter in the spongious bone of the knee condyles of two groups of four goats. These goats were sacrificed at 6 and 25 weeks. A second experiment was done on two groups of four goats with the same type of titanium alloy and hydroxyapatite-coated implants as controls and with Polyactive(R) 55-45 coated titanium alloy implants for testing. These goats were sacrificed at 9 and 25 weeks, respectively. Qualitative and quantitative differences in gap healing were evaluated through light microscopy, and initiation and direction of bone apposition were determined with fluorescence microscopy. Apposition of bone was seen directly on all hydroxyapatite surfaces and on some of the noncoated titanium alloy surfaces. The difference between the percentage of bone growth on the titanium alloy implants and the hydroxyapatite-coated implants appeared to be divergent in time: the bone growth on the noncoated implants declined after 9 weeks in contrast to the steady increase of bone growth on the hydroxyapatite-coated implants towards the 25 week follow-up time (p = 0.02). No significant difference was found between the first and the second experiment: apposition of bone on the implants differed only 6.6% on a scale of 0% to 100%. Only scarce bone growth was seen on the polyactive-coated implants in this model. The newly tested Polyactive(R) 55-45 coating apparently needs initial bone contact for bone-bonding and therefore showed hardly any direct bone formation on its surface. The clear differences in the reaction of bone to the coated and noncoated implants in this goat study and the reproducibility of these reactions of bone to the different controls indicate the sensitivity of the currently used animal model and its suitability for use as a bioactivity assay.

The biocompatibility and the biodegradability of the polymers were confirmed by subcutaneous implantation of polymer foils in rats. The newly developed polymers, two polyesters (DegraPol/bsc43 and DegraPol/bsd43) and a polyesterether (DegraPol/bst41), were found to exhibit good cell compatibility; the cell-to-substrate interactions induced neither cytotoxic effects nor activation of macrophages. The adhesion and growth of fibroblasts and macrophages were different among the substrate. Fibroblasts adhered on the polyesters to about 60% of control cell cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and proliferated in the same doubling time as on TCPS. On the polyetherester cells exhibited weak adhesion; however, they proliferated up to day 4 after plating at the same doubling time as on TCPS (of about 42 h), and then decreased their doubling time to 27 h. Macrophages attached to the polyesters to about 40-60% of TCPS but no significant change was seen in the doubling time of cells cultured on TCPS and the polyesters. Again on the polyetherester, macrophages exhibited relatively low adhesion (25% of TCPS) and high doubling time (about 100 h). Fibroblasts produced high amounts (up to 500% of control cells) of collagen type I and type IV, and fibronectin. Macrophages responded to lipopolysaccharide treatment by the production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), indicating that the cell-to-polymer interactions allow fibroblasts and macrophages to maintain their phenotype. All three test polymers exhibit favourable tissue compatibility. The formed capsule was just a few cell layers thick (< 30 mu m). After 2 months implanted subcutaneously in rats, the molecular weight of the test polymers was reduced by > 20% depending on their chemical structure. Taken collectively, the present data demonstrate that the newly developed multiblock copolyesters are biocompatible and biodegradable.","UNIV ZURICH HOSP, DEPT SURG, DIV RES, CH-8091 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND","Saad, B (reprint author), ETH ZURICH, INST POLYMERS, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.",,"Suter, Ulrich/H-8900-2013","Suter, Ulrich/0000-0001-7467-7346; Saad, Bashar/0000-0003-4052-2279",,,,24,32,32,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Osteogenic properties, and increased biomechanical properties, could be induced by combining them with human bone-forming cell populations. Progress has been hampered both by the lack of a suitable experimental assay of in vivo human bone formation and a suitable in vivo test system with wh ich to study such cells in association with biomaterials. Here, trabecular bone-derived cells and marrow stromal fibroblastic cells from four human donors aged between 14 and 27 y have been cultured in vitro then combined with a porous ceramic within diffusion chambers and implanted into athymic mice. Bone and cartilage formation was found within the chambers primed with cells cultured in the continuous presence of dexamethasone and ascorbate. These tissues were found in close apposition to the ceramic, confirming that the material is biocompatible and bioactive. These findings demonstrate both that appropriately primed human-cell populations can express the fully differentiated osteoblastic phenotype in the diffusion-chamber model, and also that this is a useful system in which to test the interactions of such cell populations with putative biomaterials.","UNIV OXFORD, NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, MRC, BONE RES LAB, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD, NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,43,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Bacterial adherence to biomaterial surfaces is an important step in the pathogenesis of prosthetic infection. The exact mechanism of prosthetic infection remains unclear. It is thought that certain bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, after adhering to biomaterial surfaces, secrete a layer polysaccharide, an extracellular substance (slime) and then form a biofilm (a biomass of bacteria and slime). The biofilm makes the embedded bacteria less accessible to the human defense system and significantly decreases antibiotic susceptibility. Before effective preventive or therapeutic measures can be achieved, the process, characteristics, or mechanism of bacterial adhesion to biomaterials have to be studied. In this review, the in-vitro experimental methods for bacterial adhesion will be discussed, which concentrates on (1) how to design a new in-vitro model of bacterial adhesion or biofilm formation, including the selection of bacteria, sample surface preparation, conducting bacterial adhesion or biofilm formation experiments, and the sample preparation for evaluation; and (2) methods for examining adhered bacteria and biofilm, which include microscopy for counting and morphological observation of adhered bacteria, viable bacterial counting methods, other direct or indirect bacterial counting methods, and the methods for evaluating biofilm.

Porcine small-intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a biomaterial which has been investigated for several applications including arterial and venous grafts and repair of tendon, ligament, body wall, and urinary bladder defects. The calcification potential of peracetic acid (PAA)-sterilized SIS was studied. Four test samples, (1) native (cleaned, untreated) SIS, (2) SIS sterilized with 0.1% PAA, (3) SIS treated with 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 20 min, and (4) commercially available glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine bioprosthetic heart valve cusp segments (GPV), were each implanted subcutaneously in each of 24 weanling rats. Six rats were euthanatized at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Evaluation of calcium concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopy and extent of mineralization and fibrosis by light microscopy were performed. Atomic absorption revealed no calcification in native or peracetic acid-treated SIS at any time point compared with preimplant calcium concentration. Statistically significant (P<0.0001) calcification occurred in glutaraldehyde-treated materials (SIS and GPV) at each evaluation as compared to native and peracetic acid-treated samples. Histopathology indicated native and peracetic acid-treated SIS showed no implant mineralization (P<0.0001) and little peri-implant fibrosis (P<0.0001). Results suggested that native and peracetic acid-treated SIS have a low calcification potential and further study of this biomaterial is warranted.

Irradiation was performed with swift heavy ions (E > 1 MeV/amu) and the grafting of styrene was achieved by the peroxide method. A characterisation of surface topography was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-rays (EDXA). Compared to the SEM micrograph of PVDF, the SEM micrographs of the polystyrene grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-PS) and the functionalised polystyrene grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-PSf) show circular ''islands'' of different sizes. EDXA analysis shows that the amount of fluorine is directly dependent on the presence of these islands. When the styrene is grafted, the amount of fluorine is lower. The swift heavy ions induce significant grafting only in small regions (the latent tracks) of the polymer. Fibrinogen and albumin adsorption from plasma on these materials was quantitatively assessed using I-125-labelled proteins prepared under a quality controlled procedure. The amount of adsorbed proteins is greater in the case of PVDF-g-PSf. For PVDF-g-PSf the rates of exchanged proteins increases when the functionalisation yield increases. The distribution of bound proteins, determined by microautoradiography seems to be homogeneous on the three different materials studied here.

Using shear controlled orientation in injection moulding (Scorim) it was possible to induce anisotropy into the mouldings and to simultaneously enhance stiffness and ductility. Degradation was studied in simulated physiological solutions (Hank's balanced salt solution) with and without added bovine serum. Both the dry weight loss and the changes in mechanical properties were determined for ageing periods up to 80 days. The degradation behaviour proved to be strongly dependent on the formulation of the material studied, and on the addition of proteins. The susceptibility of the starch/EVOH blends to degradation when sterilised with ethylene oxide (EtO) was also studied, and showed that the polymers could stand one EtO sterilisation cycle. However, two consecutive cycles severely degraded the polymer structure and properties.","INST BIOMED ENGN, INEB, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO, DEPT POLYMER ENGN, P-4800 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL; BRUNEL UNIV, WOLFSON CTR MAT PROC, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND","Reis, RL (reprint author), UNIV PORTO, FEUP, DEPT MET ENGN, RUA BRAGOS, P-4099 OPORTO, PORTUGAL.",,"Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012; Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008","Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Cunha M., Antonio/0000-0003-3860-7732",,,,18,93,95,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

The cause of aseptic loosening of prosthetic joint replacement components is unclear. Early experience with total joint arthroplasty was plagued by a number of problems that no longer exist as major impediments to long-term success, Improvements in the operating room environment and the use of prophylactic antibiotics have substantially reduced the high incidence of infection to less than 1%, Implant materials have long been considered biologically inert, but recent studies indicate that inflammatory reactions directed against the implanted materials may contribute to aseptic loosening. Currently, particulate debris from cement or polyethylene causing loosening of the prosthesis is the major problem in total joint arthroplasty. Significant data suggest a progression from a simple inflammatory reaction to complex immune responses against the biomaterials. The cellular responses to particles of polymethylmethacrylate, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, and alloys of cobalt-chromium and titanium have been assayed in vitro in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and avascular necrosis who had total joint replacement, Elevated immunologic cell proliferation responses to both acrylic and cobalt chromium were observed in patients with aseptically loosened prostheses, These findings suggest that the development of a cellular response to particulate debris may be significant in the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening.

The effects of discharge voltage (200-500 V) on Ti-O film formation were investigated. The Ti-O films deposited under various discharge voltages appeared to be uniform and adhesive. while their color tone and Luster varied with the voltage. The films obtained under a voltage higher than 250 V were hard and durable. and the ones obtained under a voltage higher than 280 V were compact with less defects. The Ti/O ratio of each film was nearly constant in depth direction and its oxygen concentration depended on the voltage, which was detected by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), On the basis of X-lay diffractometry (XRD), it was concluded that the suboxides such as Ti4O7 and Ti6O11 were formed in the films and that Ti2O was also formed under a voltage higher than 400 V. The hardness of the films increased with the increase in voltage of up to 400 V. but slightly decreased at a higher voltage range. The maximum hardness higher than Hv2000 was noteworthy.

The pH of the liquid extract was adjusted to 5. Organotins were ethylated with sodium tetraethylborate, extracted in isooctane and determined by means of a microwave-induced plasma atomic emission detector coupled to a gas chromatograph. The stability of butyl and phenyl compounds, exposed to the microwave energy, was studied as a function of the vessel temperature. The possibility of simultaneous carried-out extractions and the use of microwave to perform the ethylation and extraction of organotin compounds was also studied. The full procedure was validated with certified material NIES-11 and with real samples, by comparison with a classic leaching method using tetramethylammonium hydroxide without microwave.","UNIV SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,FAC QUIM,DEPT QUIM ANALIT NUTR & BROMATOL,E-15706 SANTIAGO COMPOSTE,SPAIN",,,"Rodriguez Pereiro, Isaac/H-4771-2015; Cela, Rafael/G-3358-2013","Rodriguez Pereiro, Isaac/0000-0002-9693-2042; Cela, Rafael/0000-0003-3076-5007; Mejuto, Carmen/0000-0001-9347-8000",,,,31,27,29,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0021-9673,,,J CHROMATOGR A,J.

Stringent requirements have been defined for construction materials. They must be light, yet sufficiently hard and rigid, and able to be machined with high precision. The friction coefficient must be low and the wear resistance high. The materials must be chemically inert and not deformable. Also, the materials must be biocompatible, and the blood contacting surface must be hemocompatible. We assessed the materials in terms of physiochemistry, mechanics, and tribology to select the best for hemocompatibility (determined by studies of protein adsorption; platelet, leukocyte, and red cell retention; and hemolysis, among other measurements) and biocompatibility (determined by measurement of complement activation and toxicity, among other criteria). Of the materials tested, for short- and middle-term assistance, we chose titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and alumina ceramic (Al2O3) and for long-term and permanent use, composite materials (TIN coating on graphite). We saw that the polishing process of the substrate must be improved.

In this report, we show the effect of the chemical structure of a synthetic polymer support on monocyte adhesion and selected phenotypic characteristics in vitro as a model for the initial steps of non-self-recognition of an implant. The extent of monocyte adhesion was significantly influenced by the support chemistry. The highest level of monocyte adhesion was observed on a surface copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate relative to results of experiments in which poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) or the copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with the sodium salt of methacrylic acid was used. Cell adhesion to the polymers tested and to glass was accompanied by enhanced expression of the carbohydrate-binding sites tested for asialoglycoprotein beta-galactosides such as galectins, beta-N-acetylgalactosamine, alpha-mannoside, specific lectin for heparin as well as the lymphokine-macrophage migration inhibitory factor in the monocytes tested. These results suggest the importance of monocyte adhesion to the biomaterial surface for their development into macrophages and further non-self-recognition of the implanted device.

When a hydrophilic surface was used to support protein binding, a somewhat lower neutrophil response (around 35%) was obtained, compared with the response induced by IgG on a hydrophobic surface. The production of ROS was completely eliminated when cytochalasin B was added to the measuring system, suggesting the involvement of the cell cytoskeleton in the activation process. The relation between the intra- and extracellular generation of ROS was further assessed, and we found that most of the ROS produced were released from the cells, in agreement with a model in which the activating surfaces induce a 'frustrated' phagocytic response.

The other materials released all of the 'bound' bFGF with two hours or produced an inflammatory response in vivo. Therefore, the lens tissue had the most potential for controlled long-term delivery of bFGF in vivo.

The polymers were prepared by chain extension with diisocyanates of PHB/HV-diol and either PCL-diol or Diorez, another aliphatic polyester-diol. Regardless of the chemical composition of the four tested polyesterurethanes used as substrates, no morphological difference was observed either in the macrophages (macrophage cell Line J774) or in the fibroblasts (fibroblast cell line 3T3) cultured on these polymers. In contrast, however, cell adhesion and growth of macrophages and fibroblasts were affected by the polymer properties. Compared to macrophages cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), cells cultured on the test polymers exhibited levels of cell adhesion that varied from 65-100% of TCPS, and the doubling time was 25-43% higher on the polymers than on TCPS. Likewise, fibroblasts adhered to the polymers at lower rates (50-85% of TCPS) and grew at higher doubling times (125-140% of TCPS). Furthermore, cells cultured on the test polymers preserved their phenotypes: fibroblasts produced high amounts (up to 280% of control cells) of collagens Type I and Type IV and fibronectin; and macrophages produced nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the same concentrations as control cells and responded to lipopolysaccharide treatment by the elevation of the production of NO and TNF-alpha, indicating that the cell-to-polymer interactions allow fibroblasts and macrophages to maintain their phenotypes. In vivo investigations showed that all four test polymers exhibit favorable tissue compatibility. The formed capsule was 60-250 mu m thick. Ln addition, the polymers are degradable. After one year's subcutaneous implantation in rats, the molecular weight of the test polymers were reduced to about 50%, depending on the composition. Taken collectively, the present data demonstrate that the newly developed polyesterurethanes are cell and tissue compatible and biodegradable.

It is found that in both outer and inner surfaces of bamboo culm, there exists-some silica. Bamboo elicits an inert response when soaked directly in calcification solution. After the rind of bamboo is treated with sodium hydroxide solution, the silica underneath can induce precipitation of calcium phosphate in an ambient environment. Furthermore, by subsequent grafting with polyethylene glycol (PEG 1000), calcium phosphate induction of bamboo rind can be improved,depending on the concentration of NaOH solution and treatment time. Heat treatment of bamboo can remove the organic materials around the minerals in bamboo, allowing the calcification behaviour of the silica-containing inorganic phase of bamboo in aqueous solution to be studied.","ACAD SINICA,INST MET RES,SHENYANG 110015,PEOPLES R CHINA","Li, SH (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV,BIOMAT RES GRP,PROF BRONKHORSTLAAN 10,NL-3723 MB BILTHOVEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,9,9,9,1,4,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Therefore, hydroxyapatite ceramics are used as coating materials. During or after the coating process, cracking and tearing often occur in the coating layer of the implant. These defects are caused by the residual stress in the vicinity of the coating interface. It is important to evaluate the residual stress in this region.

A significant proportion of the reactivity of antibodies to crude slime was also shown to be attributed to the 20-kDa polysaccharide, This polysaccharide is immunogenic in humans since blood sera derived from patients 10-15 days after confirmation of slime-producing S. epidermidis bacteremia gave approximately 16 times higher reactivity than that of healthy individuals, Antibodies to 20-kDa polysaccharide were able to recognize and react specifically with slime-positive S. epidermidis strains compared to slime-negative ones (2 to 5 times higher reactivity), Moreover, these antibodies exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences in the degree of reactivity among S. epidermidis and other staphylococci species.

In this study, the characteristics of heparinized Cuprophan membranes have been evaluated. After immobilization, heparin partially retained its biologic activity. An anticoagulant activity of 12.4 +/- 4.2 mU/cm(2) was measured using a thrombin inactivation assay. Immobilized heparin also displayed an anti-complement activity. After contact with human serum, heparinized Cuprophan induced no generation of significant amounts of fluid phase terminal complement complex (TCC), whereas untreated Cuprophan induced the generation of substantial amounts of TCC. Heparinization did not affect the permeability of Cuprophan for model solutes with molecular weights up to 12,000 g/mol except for sulfobromophthalein sodium salt. The permeability of Cuprophan for sulfobromophthalein sodium salt was slightly decreased after heparinization. The ultrafiltration rate of Cuprophan increased by about 30% after heparinization, probably owing to an increased swelling of the membrane in water. Heparinized Cuprophan incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C showed some release of heparin. These amounts of released heparin, however, were very low as compared to the amounts of heparin which are systemically administered during clinical hemodialysis treatment. It is concluded that Cuprophan membranes heparinized by means of the CDI-activation procedure are highly promising for application in hemodialyzers to be used for the treatment of patients with reduced or without systemic administration of heparin.

Biodegradable materials further provide the significant advantage that the polymer will disappear in vivo, obviating long-term negative tissue responses as well as the need for retrieval. In earlier studies we synthesized and characterized arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide-modified poly(lactic acid-co-lysine) (PLAL). In this study, both bulk properties and surface features have been characterized, with a focus on surface analysis as a means of interpreting observed changes in cell behavior. Bulk peptide attachments were performed using 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). Amino groups were measured using colorimetric assays and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Peptides were measured by incorporating iodine into the peptide as a distinct elemental marker for use with XPS. Typical samples contained 13 +/- 4 pmol/cm(2) of amino groups and 4 +/- 0.2 pmol/ cm(2) of peptides, as calculated from XPS measurements of nitrogen and iodine. The wettability and crystallinity of the samples were determined by contact angles and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively Wettability and crystallinity were not altered by the incorporation of lysine or peptides. After incubating bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells for 4 h on surfaces with RGD-containing peptides, the mean spread cell area increased from 77 +/- 2 mu m(2) to 405 +/- 29 mu m(2) compared to 116 +/- 11 mu m(2) an poly(lactic acid), 87 +/- 4 mu m(2) on PLAL, and 105 +/- 4 mu m(2) on surfaces with RDG-containing (control) peptides. The significance of this work is that the first synthetic interactive, resorbable biomaterial has been developed, and use of this material to control cell behavior has been demonstrated.

Several in vitro studies using rat or mouse clonal cell lines have shown that rhBMP-2 may be involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts from osteoblast precursor cells or stromal cells in the bone marrow. However, there is little information available about the effects of rhBMP-2 on cultured human bone marrow cells. We investigated the effects of rhBMP-2 cultured on human bone marrow cells and osteoblastic cells on various biomaterials. Human bone cells were divided into fresh bone marrow cells, fibroblast colony-forming units (cfu-F, stromal precursors), and osteoblastic cells. The cells were cultured with or without rhBMP-2 on various biomaterials, including titanium alloy, pure titanium, cobalt alloy, and hydroxyapatite. It was found that rhBMP-2 (500 ng/mL) significantly stimulated alkaline phosphatase production by fresh bone marrow cells and cfu-F. However, when cultured on titanium alloy or pure titanium, only fresh bone marrow cells showed an increase of alkaline phosphatase production after rhBMP-2 stimulation. Production of osteocalcin, a marker of mature osteoblasts, was not stimulated by rhBMP-2 in any combinations tested. These findings suggest that rhBMP-2 may be involved in inducing the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells into osteoblastic cells rather than stimulating further differentiation of osteoblastic cells into mature osteoblasts. In addition, grafts of fresh human bone marrow cells of cfu-F stimulated by rhBMP-2 may have the potential to promote bone formation at sites of nonunion as well as around titanium joint prostheses.

However, the demand for more bioresistant and biocompatible polyurethanes to meet the needs of long-term implant devices still remains an important issue. Since most biological interactions with materials occur at the interface, a significant number of studies for improving the biocompatibility of polyurethanes have concentrated on surface modification. It is well known that additives used in polymeric materials as processing aids, mold releasing agents, antioxidants, etc., migrate to the surface and change the surface properties of the material. Under certain conditions polymeric additives may also migrate toward surfaces. This study describes two fluorine-containing, surface-modifying macromolecules (SMMs) that have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit polyurethane degradation. These materials actively migrate to the upper surface of a material film when they are mixed with a base polymeric material. Contact angle measurements for the mixture of SMM with base polyurethane indicate that the surface becomes more hydrophobic after adding the SMMs, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows an enrichment of fluorine on the polymer surfaces. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms indicate that the microstructure, as defined by the thermal transitions of the base polymer, are not altered by the addition of SMMs. Enzyme-induced biodegradation tests exhibit a significant reduction of polyurethane degradation in the presence of these surface-resident materials. The results indicate that the SMMs have the potential to resist hydrolytic degradation mediated by lysosomal enzymes while generating a surface chemistry on the native elastomer which is similar in nature to that of a fluoropolymer, e.g., Teflon.(R) (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","UNIV TORONTO,FAC DENT,DEPT BIOMAT,TORONTO,ON M5G 1G6,CANADA; UNIV OTTAWA,INST HEART,CARDIOVASC DEVICES DIV,OTTAWA,ON,CANADA; UNIV OTTAWA,DEPT CHEM ENGN,OTTAWA,ON,CANADA",,,,,,,,41,53,55,1,23,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The gap-junctional intercellular communication of test cells was inhibited on the PE film, but this inhibitory activity was markedly decreased when the surface of the PE film was immobilized with collagen. These results suggest that the in vivo tumor promotion activity of the untreated PE may be stronger than that of collagen-immobilized PE. On the other hand, surface modification with RGDS peptide, which is well known as the sequence of cell attachment domain in extracellular matrix proteins, did not reduce the promotion activity of PE film. In addition, neither modification with bovine serum albumin nor RGES peptide reduced the activity of PE film. These findings suggest that reduction of the inhibitory activity on gap-junctional intercellular communication by collagen immobilization is not simply due to improved cell adherence via the RGDS sequence but to some cell-cell recognition via collagen molecules essential for the gap-junctional intercellular communication.

The surface tension of the liquids is measured as a function of time by the pendant drop method and the surface tension of the solids is determined from the experimental contact angles of water and diiodomethane, using the geometric mean, the harmonic mean and the equation of state approaches. These values together with the contact angles measured before [A.P. Serro et al., Biomaterials, submitted] are used in the Young equation to obtain the solid/liquid interfacial tension. The liquid samples are Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with a composition similar to the blood plasma and solutions of bovine serum albumin(BSA) in HBSS. The solid substrates are titanium samples of three types: oxidized by exposure to air (type 0), pre-incubated in HBSS (type 1) and pre-incubated in HBSS+BSA solutions (type 2). For all the substrates the solid/liquid interfacial tension involving the protein solution is higher than the equivalent value obtained with the solvent which should be related to the hydrophilicity of these substrates. The decrease of gamma(SL) with time for the substrate of type 2 may be explained by protein desorption.

The model incorporates the mechanical energy in calcified tissue due to time-varying loads into the more commonly used energetic arguments for mineralization BY using the Voight (equal-strain) and Reuss (equal-stress) composite material models to relate the volumetric density of calcified tissue to overall material modules, two models were developed to assess the effect of an imposed overall material strain on mineralization. A rate equation based on strain energy was used to model the kinetics of mineralization, and the stability of the rate equation was assessed, leading to a limit on overall material strain based on the specific energy for mineralization of soft tissues The result depended on the stiffness of the material in series with the mineralizing tissue. Taking the stiffness of the material in series with the tissue as infinite lead to a prediction of critical strain for mineralization in the calcifying biological tissue which was the same on the Reuss and Voight models. The interaction of this theoretical model with biological factors and some clinical implications Of the model are discussed.

Sterilised sacks were filled with heparinised blood, rotated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and sequential samples collected into 0.103 M sodium citrate. Thrombin generation measured by thrombin-antithrombin III complexes showed a difference between the polymers at 3 h through to 6 h (P < 0.05), C94 showing the least activation and C34 the most. Factor XIIa and D-dimer levels increased between 12 (P(0.05) and 24 h (P < 0.01) for all polyetherurethanes. The ratio of soft:hard segments (which determine hydrophobicity) of the polyetherurethanes showed a direct relationship with the degree of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. There was no significant increase in monocyte tissue factor expression at 5 and 105 min. Platelet function as measured by whole blood platelet aggregation showed a reduction with pellethane and C94 after Ih using collagen, with no changes for C34.

How to control, reduce, or eliminate the ice formation has been an important research topic in fundamental cryobiology. The objective of this study was to test a hypothesis that the coupled interaction of microwave radiation and cryoprotectant concentration could significantly influence ice formation and enhance potential vitrification in cryopreservation media at a relative slow cooling rate. Test samples consisted of a series of solutions with ethylene glycol (a cryoprotectant) concentration ranging from 3 to 5.5 M. A specific microwave resonant cavity was built and utilized to provide an intense oscillating electric field. Solutions were simultaneously exposed to this electric field and cooled to -196 degrees C by rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen. Control samples were similarly submerged in liquid nitrogen but without the microwave field. The amount of ice formation was determined by analysis of digital images of the samples. The morphology of the solidified samples was observed by cryomicroscopy. It was found that ice formation was greatly influenced by microwave irradiation. For example, ice formation could be reduced by roughly 56% in 3.5 M ethylene glycol solutions. An average reduction of 66% was observed in 4.5 M solutions. Statistical analysis indicated that the main effects of microwave and ethylene glycol concentration as well as the interaction between these two factors significantly (P < 0.01) influenced ice formation amount, confirming the hypothesis. This preliminary study suggests that a combined use of microwave irradiation and cryoprotectant might be a potential approach to control ice formation in cells/tissues during the cooling process and to enhance vitrification of these biomaterials for long-term cryopreservation.

The mRNA probe was labeled by digoxigenin; the antisense was used for detection, and the sense was used as control. Macrophage cells were incubated with MAA and HEMA for 72 hours in a 96-well microplate, The negative control was macrophage cells without test materials and the positive control was lipopolysaccharide (LPS), After cell fixation and RNA denaturation, the cells were prehybridized with tRNA followed by the addition of the mRNA probe. After post-hybridization washes, antidigoxigenin antibody, and biotin-avidin-alkaline phosphatase were used for microscopic visualization of a purple precipitate that is confirmatory of TNF-alpha mRNA production, Using this test system, MAA and HEMA were both positive for TNF-alpha mRNA production, This result agreed with earlier tests demonstrating potential utility of the probe method for biomaterial cytokine induction studies.",,,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538",0888-319X,,,IN VITRO TOXICOL,In Vitro Toxicol.,SUM,1997.0,10,2,,,,,245,251,,,,,,7,Toxicology,Toxicology,XT134,WOS:A1997XT13400009,,,,,2019-02-25

The coated HAP layer was tightly attached to the surface of the titanium plate, at least at the level of scanning electron microscopy, Interestingly, the HAP particles stuck together at room temperature as if they were sintered, The coating was stable against ultrasonication in water for at least 5 min, and it was difficult to remove by nail scratching, Thus, the bonding strength between the HAP powder and the titanium plate was much higher than that achieved with currently employed room temperature coating processes such as dipping, electrophoretic deposition, and electrochemical deposition, Therefore, the blast coating method is potentially valuable for the fabrication of useful biomaterials for hard tissue replacement.

However, the cement is not without its drawbacks. The main one is the role that it has been postulated to play in the aseptic loosening and, hence, clinical life of the arthroplasty. In turn, this role is directly related to the mechanical properties of the cement, especially the resistance to fracture of the cement in the mantle at the cement-prosthesis interface or the cement-bone interface. The present work is a detailed critical review of the recent literature on the properties of bone cement that are considered germane to its use in the stated application, The relevant properties are identified and a case is made for including each of them, Compilations of the values of these properties, obtained under clearly identified conditions, are presented for the six commercial formulations of bone cement in current popular orthopedic use. The gaps and unresolved questions in the current data base, efforts that should be made to address these issues, and research directions are covered.

Exposure of isotactic polypropylene to ozone resulted in surface oxidation, as detected by ESCA, and the formation of peroxides and hydroperoxides. The amount of oxygen-bearing moieties, as detected by FT-IR, was increased when a microporous membrane with a large surface area was used. Ozonation for an extended period of time, 1-2 h, resulted in a degradation of microporous PP, observed with SEM as an enlargement of pores and brittle characteristics of the material. The molecular weight of PP was dramatically reduced after as little as 5 min of ozonation. Exposure to ozone for longer periods of time contributed to further reductions of the molecular weight and gradual modification of chemical composition of polypropylene, restricted, however, to the surface or intercrystalline amorphous regions. It was possible to graft 2-hydroxyethylemthacrylate (HEMA) to the ozonated samples, such that the graft copolymer acted as continiuous matrix consequently linked to and reinforced by the PP crystals.

The family of patents formed the basis for several promising innovative biomaterials devices. However, only one commercial product has been realized. That product is the very successfull coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) now widely used in orthopaedic surgery, oral and maxillofacial bone repair and plastic surgery. This paper challenges the equation of discovery with a genuine innovation which reaches the marketplace. The paper reviews several aspects of the innovation and development history with an emphasis on the challenges of bringing any new biomaterial through all the conceptual, developmental, business and regulatory hurdles. New class three medical devices require huge investments of time and money typically requiring a minimum of eight years and 15-20 million dollars per new device to take it from concept to an approved product. These hurdles are so high that most research innovations in biomaterials never get put into the developmental pipeline. This paper is presented from an anecdotal perspective of an innovator who has had a continuous research and development involvement in the technology but has no significant management involvement beyond the early startup activities. It differs from predecessors is that it deals not only with the initial step of discovery but in the very difficult steps that follow on the road to a real innovation. Several strategies that may help other R&D groups outside the biomedical industry shorten the development cycle and increase the probability that a given biomaterials innovation can be seen through to approved product are discussed. Guidelines are suggested for culling out ideas that are technically sound but that likely won't lead to successful products.",,"White, EW (reprint author), RD 1 Box 182, Rossiter, PA 15772 USA.",,,,,,,19,6,6,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1432-8917,,,MATER RES INNOV,Mater.

The mechanism of integration of such material usually is evaluated by histologic analysis. The trace elements present in bone can be detected in the ceramic and help to provide a semiquantitative evaluation of osseointegration. Two different methods of microanalysis, energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and proton induced x-emission (PIXE) were used in this study to determine the appearance of trace elements (Zn, Sr, and Fe) present in bone at the implantation site containing the ceramic. Porous HA-ceramic cylinders were implanted in the cortical bone of sheep femurs for periods ranging from 2 to 36 weeks. Thick sections of the implant-containing bone were made at the end of the implantation period. A scanning line with proton or electron impacts 0.5 mm apart was plotted from the edges of the cortical bone across the implanted ceramic and the resulting x-ray spectra were determined. Following EDS analysis, the sections were surface-stained, observed under a light microscope, and the pore volume occupied by bone tissue was measured. The spectra obtained by PIXE method showed two regions for each element characterising either the bone tissue or the ceramic. Zinc and strontium present in the bone tissue, but absent from the ceramic, appeared 8 and 12 weeks after implantation, respectively. The concentration of iron present in the implant decreased with time. EDS showed no significant level of either element in the bone or the ceramic. Histologic observation revealed that immature bone invaded the pores of the outer layer of the ceramic as early as 2 weeks after implantation. The ceramics were totally osseointegrated 20 weeks after implantation, although ceramic degradation continued for longer. In this experiment, the PIXE method was apparently sufficiently sensitive for monitoring the amount of trace element appearing in bone-implanted material.","UNIV TOULOUSE 3, LAB TISSU OSSEUX & PATHOL OSTEOARTICULAIRES, F-31062 TOULOUSE, FRANCE; UNIV CLERMONT FERRAND, PHYS PARTICULES LAB, CLERMONT FERRAND, FRANCE; FAC SCI, INST PHYS NUCL EXPT, LIEGE, BELGIUM","Frayssinet, P (reprint author), BIOLAND, 132 RTE ESPAGNE, F-31100 TOULOUSE, FRANCE.",,,,,,,17,9,9,1,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0161-0457,1932-8745,,SCANNING,Scanning,JUN,1997.0,19,4,,,,,253,257,,,,,,5,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,XF007,WOS:A1997XF00700002,9195748.0,,,,2019-02-25

Precut segments of full silicone, silver-coated and hydrogel-coated ureteric stents were incubated with two uropathogenic bacterial strains with and without previous immersion in antibiotic solution. Tobramycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin solutions were used, as these antibiotics are commonly administered for the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). Microbiological analysis showed that immersion of ureteric stents in ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin yielded a significant reduction of bacterial adhesion, whereas immersion in tobramycin did not. The surface material of the stents had no direct influence on bacterial adhesion. In this experimental study, neither the silver nor the hydrogel coat reduced bacterial adhesion onto ureteric stents whereas immersion in a suitable antibiotic solution significantly reduced and even prevented this phenomenon, probably due to the adhesion of the antibiotic onto the stent surface. Prevention of bacterial adhesion onto ureteric stents is essential to reduce the risk of UTI in connection with these devices.","UNIV HELSINKI,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; UNIV BARI,SCH MED,CHAIR UROL R,BARI,ITALY",,,,,,,,18,13,13,0,3,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0300-5623,,,UROL RES,Urol.

The SEC film can be used as an inert, stable and hydrophobic electrode in aqueous solution over a wide potential range. In this study, the physical and the potential-assisted adsorption of various proteins on the SEC film is described. Because of the hydrophobic surface characteristic proteins easily adsorb and retain on the film surface by strong hydrophobic interactions. The amount of the adsorbed protein varies from 2.2 to 4.8 mu g cm(-2) depending on the protein when the film is incubated for 22 h in the protein solution. The adsorption is effectively accelerated and enhanced by applying a positive potential in the range from 0.4 V to 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The potential-assisted adsorption process is completed by 10-15 min and the amount of the adsorbed protein is nearly doubled as compared to the adsorption without potential. The adsorbed protein is chemically very stable in comparison with the protein in solution. More than 85% of the initial adsorbed proteins retains on the surface after three weeks of incubation in buffer solution. The initial adsorption rate is studied by quartz crystal micro-balance measurements on a thin polymer film coated quartz crystal. In addition, the SEC film surface is etched with air plasma which leads to a four-fold increase of the adsorption of proteins.

Following growth in human urine, the cell surface,hydrophobicity and zeta potential of two ureteral stent biofilm isolates, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, were significantly altered. In addition, the adherence of human urine-grown Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli to polyurethane was significantly increased by up to 52.1% and 58.6%, respectively. Treatment of the polyurethane with human urine rendered the polymer surface more hydrophilic (mean advancing water contact angle reduced from 97.59 degrees to 26.37 degrees). However, organisms grown in human urine showed less adherence (up to 90.4%) to the treated polymer than those grown in Mueller-Hinton broth. The results presented in this study indicate that in vivo conditions should be simulated as far as possible when carrying out in vitro bacterial adherence assays, especially if assessing novel methods for reduction of adherence.

Colonisation of a biomaterial surface with urea-splitting bacteria also causes alkalinisation of the urine with subsequent formation of encrusting deposits of struvite and hydroxyapatite. This study examined the role of both bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and biomaterial hydrophobicity in urinary device infection and encrustation. The polymers formed and investigated were poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and copolymers of PMMA with PHEMA (75:25, 50:50 and 25:75 w/w, respectively). Polymer surfaces were characterised by dynamic contact angle measurement in water. Polymer encrustation and adhesion of a hydrophilic Escherichia coli urinary isolate and a hydrophobic Enterococcus faecalis urinary isolate were also determined. The hydrophobic PMMA polymer was more effective in resisting encrustation than all of the more hydrophilic PMMA/PHEMA copolymer series. Adhesion of the hydrophilic Escherichia coli isolate to the copolymers increased with decreasing copolymer hydrophobicity. A relationship was not apparent between copolymer hydrophobicity and adherence of the hydrophobic Enterococcus faecalis isolate.

Persantin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation and is widely used as a vasodilator. Conjugate 1 consists of triply protected dipyridamole [three of the four hydroxyl groups carry a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) protective group) and the photoreactive 4-azidobenzoyl group. A short hydrophilic spacer chain, derived from triethylene glycol, separates the protected dipyridamole system and the photoreactive group. Compound 1 was immobilized on polyurethane sheets (Pellethane D-55) through irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light, and the protective groups were removed afterward. The resulting modified polyurethane surfaces were characterized by different physicochemical techniques: UV extinction, contact angle measurements (captive bubble technique), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The UV extinction measurements showed the presence of 13 +/- 1 nmol of immobilized dipyridamole/cm(2). The contact angle measurements revealed that the modified surface was markedly more hydrophilic than the control (i.e. unmodified polyurethane). XPS measurements clearly established the presence of immobilized dipyridamole in the outermost layers of the modified surface. This was especially clear from the XPS spectra recorded at a low take-off angle (similar to 6 degrees). Furthermore, the XPS spectra showed that the TBDMS protective groups had been quantitatively removed during the deprotection/washing treatment. The in vitro blood compatibility of the modified surface was studied with the thrombin generation assay as developed in our group, as well as with scanning electron microscopy. The thrombin generation test produced a lag time of 1275 s for the modified surface, as opposed to 569 s for the control. Scanning electron microscopy showed that far fewer platelets adhere to the modified surface (approximately 7 x 10(3)/mm(2)) as compared to the control (approximately 6 x 10(2)/mm(2)). Taken together, the experimental data reveal that the modified surface has excellent blood compatibility in vitro. It is discussed that the use of conjugate 1 leads to simultaneous exposure of dipyridamole at the modified surface and to a marked increase of the surface hydrophilicity, which is likely to hamper adsorption of plasma proteins. The combination of these effects is uniquely related to the molecular buildup of 1. Conjugate 1 will be used in future work that is aimed at preparing small-caliber polyurethane vascular grafts with a blood compatible lumenal surface.","DSM RES BV, NL-6160 MD GELEEN, NETHERLANDS","Aldenhoff, YBJ (reprint author), UNIV LIMBURG, CTR BIOMAT RES, POB 616, NL-6200 MD MAASTRICHT, NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,32,11,11,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1043-1802,,,BIOCONJUGATE CHEM,Bioconjugate Chem.,MAY-JUN,1997.0,8,3,,,,,296,303,,10.1021/bc970020z,,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Organic",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,XB627,WOS:A1997XB62700006,9177834.0,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies have demonstrated that the physical characteristics of the implant, and not the chemical composition, are the critical determinants of tumour development. The recent controversy over silicone breast implants has raised questions regarding the potential carcinogenicity of lifetime tissue exposure to silicone products. The present study was designed to determine whether the inflammatory and fibrotic reactions associated with silicone implants are due to a non-specific foreign-body reaction or whether these responses reflect the unique chemical composition of silicone. F344 rats were implanted subcutaneously with one of three biomaterials: silicone elastomer (Group 1), impermeable cellulose acetate filters (Group 2, positive control); or porous cellulose acetate filters (Group 3, negative control). The silicone and cellulose implants of Groups 1 and 2 have been previously shown to induce fibrosarcomas in rodents, whereas the porous cellulose acetate implants of Group 3 have been shown to be non-carcinogenic. One week and two months after implantation, the pericapsular tissues were evaluated using histopathological and in situ immunohistochemical analyses. Endpoints included expression of leucocyte antigens CD4 (T helper/inducer), CD8 (T suppressor/cytotoxic) and CD11 b/c (macrophage), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an indicator of proliferation, and in situ end-labelling (ISEL) of 3' OH DNA strand breaks as an indicator of DNA damage and apoptosis. The results indicated that the acute and chronic cellular responses to silicone (Group 1) were not different from impermeable cellulose filters (Group 2) of identical size and shape, suggesting that these responses were not unique to silicone. The inflammatory response to the carcinogenic cellulose and silicone implants (Groups 1 and 2) was attenuated and associated with the formation of a thick fibrotic capsule. In contrast, the porous cellulose filters (Group 3) induced a markedly different cellular response in which the inflammatory reaction was more extensive, prolonged and associated with minimal fibrosis. Within the fibrotic capsule surrounding the tumorigenic implants, but not the non-tumorigenic implants, cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death were increased and associated with persistent DNA strand breaks. Taken together, the results suggest that the micrometre-scale surface morphology of the implant determines the nature of the subsequent cellular response which may predispose to tumour development Further, these studies serve to emphasize the critical importance of appropriate physical controls in studies designed to evaluate carcinogenic or autoimmune manifestations associated with silicone implants in order to rule out the contribution of the chronic foreign-body reaction.

However, few studies have directly addressed the effects upon the adjacent soft tissue. The present study was designed to test the biological effects of various sized hydroxyapatite (HA) particles on myoblasts and fibroblasts. Both the myoblasts and fibroblasts were mixed in in vitro culture with 0.1% (1 mg ml(-1)) of various sized HA particles (0.5-3.0, 37-63, 177-250, 420-841 mu m) for 1 h, 3 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days to test their effects on the cell culture. The results show that adding HA particles into a cell culture can decrease the cell count significantly. The transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations in the culture medium decreased significantly on addition of HA particles. When calculated as a ratio to the cell number, the TGF-beta 1 titre increased most significantly in the groups of medium-sized particles. The prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) concentrations in the medium increased significantly. The changes in TGF-beta 1 and PGE(2) concentrations with the smallest particles were most significant and persisted longer. The inhibitory effects of the HA particles on the cell culture were mediated by the increased synthesis of PGE(2). Caution should be exercised before considering the use of an HA product which could easily break down into a fine powder.

Thrombin, a pivotal enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade primarily responsible for thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell activation, has been the target of numerous strategies to prevent this phenomenon from occurring. The purpose of this study was to covalently immobilize the potent, specific antithrombin agent recombinant hirudin (rHir) to a modified Dacron surface and characterize the in vitro efficacy of thrombin inhibition by this novel biomaterial surface. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was selected as the 'basecoat' protein, was reacted with various molar ratios of the cross-linker sulphosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulpho-SMCC; 1:5-1:50). These BSA-SMCC complexes were then covalently linked to sodium hydroxide-hydrolysed Dacron (HD) segments via the cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Covalent linkage of these complexes to HD (HD-BSA-SMCC) was not affected by any of the sulpho-SMCC cross-linker ratios assayed. rHir, which was initially reacted with 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's reagent) in order to create sulphydryl groups, was then covalently bound to these HD-BSA-SMCC surfaces (HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir). The 1:50 (BSA: sulpho-SMCC) HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments bound 22-fold more rHir (111 ng per mg Dacron) compared to control segments and also possessed the greatest thrombin inhibition of the segments evaluated using a chromogenic substrate assay for thrombin. Further characterization of the HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments demonstrated that maximum thrombin inhibition was 20.43 NIHU, 14.6-fold greater inhibition than control segments (1.4 NIHU). Thrombin inhibition results were confirmed by I-125-thrombin binding experiments, which demonstrated that the 1:50 HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments had significantly greater specific thrombin adhesion compared to control segments. Non-specific I-125-thrombin binding to and release from the 1:50 HD-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments was also significantly less than the control segments. Thus, these results demonstrate that rHir can be covalently bound to a clinically utilized biomaterial (Dacron) while still maintaining its ability to bind and inhibit thrombin.

Morphogenesis is the cascade of pattern formation and the attainment of form of the various organs and the organism as a whole. The periodontium consists of the periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. Bone has considerable potential for regeneration and therefore is a prototypic model for tissue engineering. The three main ingredients for tissue engineering are regulatory signals, responding stem cells, and extracellular matrix. Recent advances in molecular biology of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have set the stage for tissue engineering of bone and related tissues, including the periodontium. Bone-derived BMPs, with a collagenous matrix as carrier, induced cementum and alveolar bone regeneration in surgically created furcation defects in the primate. It is noteworthy that there was morphogenesis of periodontal ligament and a faithful insertion of: Sharpey's fibers into cementum, In the same furcation model, recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1, also known as BMP-7), in conjunction with the collagenous carrier, induced extensive cementogenesis with insertion of Sharpey's fibers into the newly formed cementum. The observation that BMPs induce cementogenesis and periodontal ligament formation indicates that these proteins may have multiple functions in vivo not limited to cartilage and bone induction. The rapid advances in the molecular biology of BMPs and their receptors bode well for novel strategies to engineer the regeneration of the periodontal tissues.","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT BIOL CHEM,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,LAB MUSCULOSKELETAL CELL BIOL,BALTIMORE,MD 21205","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), UNIV WITWATERSRAND,SCH MED,MRC,BONE RES LAB,7 YORK RD,ZA-2193 PARKTOWN,JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.",,,,,,,86,126,127,0,8,INT AMER ASSOC DENTAL RESEARCH,ALEXANDRIA,"1619 DUKE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-3406",1045-4411,,,CRIT REV ORAL BIOL M,Crit.

In this study, the effects of polylysine (a basic poly-amino acid with a net positive charge which is often used to coat biomaterials surfaces) on the erythroleukemic K562 cell membrane were investigated. In particular, the effects of this polycation were evaluated using dielectric relaxation studies in the radiofrequency range with which it is possible to measure both active ionic transport across the cell membrane (membrane conductivity) and the static charge distribution present on the cell surface due to the structural components of the cell membrane (membrane permittivity). The conductivity of the cytosol can also be determined. The results demonstrate that while the conductivity of the cytosol is not significantly altered, both the conductivity and permittivity of the K562 cell membrane are varied by exposure of these cells to polylysine. These observations indicate that both active ionic transport and the type, quantity, or distribution of membrane components such as lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides may also be altered. Although the precise mechanisms by which these variations in K562 cells occur are unknown, it can be hypothesized that changes in the growth characteristics of these cells may be in part responsible. In particular, as demonstrated by light microscopic examination of K562 cells directly in the culture flasks, the cells in polylysine-coated flasks do not grow in suspension as do the controls, but rather show anchorage-dependent-like behavior. It is this important change from suspension to monolayer growth induced by polylysine that may be responsible for the changes in membrane electrical parameters.

Setting: Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices, Department of Ophthalmology, Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Methods: Seven IOL styles comprising various biomaterials were studied: fluorine-treated (Fluorlens(TM)), heparin-surface-modified (HSM(TM)), hydrogel, Memory-Lens(TM), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), soft acrylic, and silicone lenses; the human crystalline lens was also studied. Each lens was immersed in silicone oil for 12 hours, then photographed, studied by scanning electron microscopy (except the crystalline lens), and subjected to computer-generated image analysis to determine the silicone oil coverage. Results: Silicone oil coverage of dry silicone lenses was 100% and of lenses immersed in normal saline, 82.5%. The least coverage was on the heparin-surface-modified lens (mean score 9.4%). Coverage of the other four lenses ranged from approximately 15.1% to 33.7%. Mean coverage of the human lens capsule was 10.9%. Conclusion: Although a silicone IOL shows maximal adherence to silicone oil, other lens biomaterials are not immune to this complication. Silicone oil coverage was related to the dispersive energy component of the surface charge of the IOL biomaterial. Low dispersive energy materials had less silicone oil coverage, while those with higher dispersive energy had more oil coverage.",,"Apple, DJ (reprint author), MED UNIV S CAROLINA,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,STORM EYE INST,CTR RES OCULAR THERAPEUT & BIODEVICES,CHARLESTON,SC 29425, USA.",,,,,,,19,59,64,0,8,AMER SOC CATARACT REFRACTIVE SURGERY,FAIRFAX,"4000 LEGATO RD, SUITE 850, FAIRFAX, VA 22030",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Last, but not least, repositioning of the facial mask is the ''final touch'' for these complex reconstructive procedures. The concept of total facial rehabilitation may be considered an evolution of reconstructive surgery. Surgical strategies, new technologies, as well as clinical cases will be presented.","UNIV FERRARA,CLIN MAXILLOFACIAL SURG,I-44100 FERRARA,ITALY","Clauser, L (reprint author), HOSP VICENZA,DEPT CRANIOMAXILLOFACIAL SURG,I-36100 VICENZA,ITALY.",,,,,,,9,2,2,0,0,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

Each segment was immersed in activated whole blood and the weight of the adherent thrombus was measured at specified intervals. At 6 and 7 min the saline-denucleated group accumulated significantly less thrombus than control (p <.05). Alginate alone was not significantly different from controls. The graft segments treated with alginate+iloprost accumulated significantly less thrombus (p <.05) than all other groups after 6 min.

The thermal properties of these films were characterized by dynamical mechanical thermal analysis and by differential scanning calorimetry as a function of their water content. During a temperature increase, the films produced sudden changes in mechanical property and specific heat, which are classicaly associated with the glass-rubber transition for amorphous materials. The glass transition was about 20 degrees C broad. Increasing the film water content involved a non-linear decrease in glass transition temperature. The thermodynamic theory of the glass transition (i.e. the Couchman-Karasz equation) was inadequate to describe fully the plasticizing effect of water on the films.

The mechanical properties of bioartificial materials prepared using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) as synthetic components, and collagen (SC), gelatin, starch, hyaluronic acid (HA) and dextran as biological components, were investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The materials were prepared in the form of films or hydrogels and treated by glutaraldehyde (GTA) vapour or thermal dehydration in order to reduce their solubility in water. The results indicate that SC/PVA, gelatin/PVA and starch/PVA films behave as biphasic systems, showing good mechanical properties over a wide range of temperature. It was observed that the GTA procedure affects only the biological component of the SC/PVA and gelatin/PVA blends, whilst the thermal treatment in fluences mainly the synthetic polymer. In the case of HA/PVA hydrogels, a modulus variation was found with the HA content related to the organization degree and perfection of the PVA network structure. It seems evident that, in the experimental conditions used, dextran/PAA mixtures behave as miscible blends showing a glass transition intermediate between those of the pure components. With both untreated and GTA-treated gelatin/PMAA blends, it was not possible to evaluate the miscibility of the systems; it could only be affirmed that these materials show good mechanical properties over a wide range of temperature.",,"Cascone, MG (reprint author), UNIV PISA,DEPT CHEM ENGN,VIA DIOTISALVI 2,I-56126 PISA,ITALY.",,,,,,,17,77,80,1,22,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

Pathologists must be aware of the controversy and treat each SBI and associated tissue as a potential lawsuit. Grossly, silicone is a clear, viscous substance that may be observed either within or extruding from a silastic bag. By light microscopy, silicone is a nonstainable, nonpolarizable, refractile substance. Thicker sections, especially when viewed by non-Kohler illumination, phase-contrast, and darkfield microscopy will enhance visualization. Ultrastructurally, silicone is an electron-dense, amorphous substance often located within phagocytic vacuoles or extracellularly within the stroma. Correlating electron probe microanalysis allows for reliable identification. In most cases, a fibrous capsule surrounds the SBI, with the interface lining varying from a virtually acellular to a synovial-like lining composed of phagocytic and secretory cells. Silicone can often be identified within the fibrous capsule and also in distant tissues biopsied for suspected autoimmune disorders, such as synovium, skin, and lymph nodes, often without ultrastructural evidence of cytologic effects. This study has demonstrated that silicone accumulates at distant tissue sites due to preexisting inflammation acting as a stimulus. Thus, silicone is not a primary inducer of inflammatory disease processes. These findings are supported by various large epidemiologic studies.","MED UNIV S CAROLINA,DEPT PATHOL & LAB MED,CHARLESTON,SC 29425",,,,,,,,46,15,16,0,1,HEMISPHERE PUBL CORP,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",0191-3123,,,ULTRASTRUCT PATHOL,Ultrastruct.

At neutral pH the interaction is quite weak but at acidic pH and especially below the isoelectric point of albumin the interaction becomes pronounced: about 0.42 g of heparin is bound per 1 g of albumin at pH 3. The stoichiometry of the complex at saturation corresponds to the state of charge equivalence. The dependence of heparin binding on the ionic strength shows an inexpressive maximum in ca. 0.2 M NaCl (pH 4.0), apparently due to a less extended conformation of heparin. The primary albumin monolayer adsorbed on a solid support by hydrophobic interaction can serve as an anchor for the sequential adsorption of alternating monolayers of heparin and albumin and thus multiple layers with a sandwich-like architecture are deposited on the surface, The adsorption in each step reaches saturation determined by the charge equivalence and the composition of the bilayers tends to be the same regardless of their distance from the surface. The approach described makes it possible to cover surfaces with a regular multilayer of a required and uniform thickness.

The methodologies to assemble optobioelectronic devices are reviewed. One method involves the chemical modification of redox enzymes with photoisomerizable units and their integration with electrode surfaces. In one photoisomer state the protein structure is perturbed and its bioelectrocatalytic activities are blocked. In the second photoisomer state, the tertiary structure of the protein is retained and the enzyme exhibits bioelectrocatalytic functions. This method is exemplified by the chemical modification of glucose oxidase (GOx) with photoisomerizable nitrospiropyran units and with the reconstitution of apo-GOx with the photoisomerizable nitrospiropyran-FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide phosphate) cofactor. The two systems enable the cyclic amplified amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoactive proteins. The second approach to assemble optobioelectronic systems involves the organization of photoisomerizable monolayers on electrode surfaces acting as 'optical command surfaces' for the control of the electrical contact between redox proteins (or redox enzymes) and the electrode. This method is exemplified by the control of the electrical contact of cytochrome c (Cyt. c) with a functionalized electrode consisting of a mixed monolayer of pyridine/nitrospiropyran assembled onto an Au-electrode. The ON-OFF photostimulated electrical contact of Cyt. c with the electrode is coupled to mediated electron transfer cascades, i.e. bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of oxygen by cytochrome oxidase (COx). The systems allow the amplified amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoisomerizable monolayer-electrode. The photochemically-triggered activation or deactivation of the electrical communication between Cyt. c and the electrode, originate from the association or repulsion of the protein From the photoisomerizable monolayer-electrode interface. This enables the microgravimetric transduction of the optical signals recorded by the monolayer using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The photostimulated electrical contact of Cyt. c and the electrode, and the subsequent activation of an electron transfer cascade via the electrobiocatalyzed reduction of oxygen by COx, allow the amplified amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the monolayer-functionalized-electrode. Reversible immunosensors based on photoisomerizable antigen monolayers assembled onto electrodes represent another configuration of an optobioelectronic device. Assembly of an antigen monolayer on electrodes yields an active interface for the amperometric transduction of the association of the complementary antibody (Ab) to the monolayer. Binding of the Ab to the monolayer blocks the electrical contact of a redox enzyme, i.e. ferrocene-modified glucose oxidase (Fc-GOx), with the electrode, and inhibits the electrobiocatalyzed oxidation of glucose. A photoisomerizable antigen assembled as a monolayer on an electrode allows the tailoring of reversible immunosensing interfaces. In one photoisomer state, the monolayer acts as an active interface for amperometric detection of the antibody. The complementary photoisomer state lacks affinity for the Ab and allows the washing-off of the antibody and the regeneration of the active antigen monolayer by a second illumination cycle. This approach is exemplified by the application of a dinitrospiropyran monolayer assembled onto an Au-electrode as a reversible sensing interface for the dinitrophenyl antibody (DNP-Ab). The dinitrospiropyran monolayer, SP-state, acts as an active interface for the association of the DNP-Ab. Photoisomerization of the monolayer to the dinitromerocyanine configuration, MRH+-state, allows the washing-off of the DNP-Ab and the regeneration of the active SP-monolayer electrode by a secondary photoinduced isomerization. The reversible photostimulated binding and dissociation of DNP-Ab to and from the electrode is transduced by the application of Fc-GOx as odor probe and is further supported by microgravimetric QCM analyses.

Microspheres were made by the solvent evaporation method using an oil/water (o/w) system. The brain protein adsorption experiment was performed by using a sonication eluting method. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to examine the brain proteins adsorbed. Ethyl cellulose microspheres were used in the study as a reference. The amount of brain proteins adsorbed on PLGA microspheres was also determined using a radiolabeling technique. The extent of brain proteins adsorbed on the PLGA microspheres was found to be lower than that adsorbed on the ethyl cellulose microspheres. The adsorption of brain proteins on PLGA microspheres, however, was significant, as indicated quantitatively by the I-125 labeling studies. The adsorption of brain proteins on the surface of the PLGA microspheres may be important when considering the use of this polymer as a brain implant delivery system.","UNIV GEORGIA,COLL PHARM,ATHENS,GA 30602",,,,,,,,30,10,10,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",1071-7544,,,DRUG DELIV,Drug Deliv.,APR-JUN,1997.0,4,2,,,,,129,134,,10.3109/10717549709051884,,,,6,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,YJ343,WOS:A1997YJ34300010,,,,,2019-02-25

Design: Experimental open study. Setting: Experimental research centre, France. Material: 21 mongrel dogs randomised into three groups of 7 each. Intervention: Standard transverse colonic end-to-end anastomoses were secured with two-layer oxidised collagen I + III sponge covered with thin crosslinked collagen IV film (APP 1) glued around the suture (n = 7); two-layer oxidised collagen I + III sponge covered with thin non-crosslinked collagen I + III film patch (APP 2) (n = 7); or sealed by fibrin sealant (n = 7), which acted as a controls. Main outcome measures: Gross examination, radiological control (barium enemas), and microscopic examination on day 35 postoperatively. Results: Gross clinical and radiological examinations on day 35 showed normal wound healing in all but one dog in which the anastomoses had occluded by day 16. There was significantly less stricturing with the APP 2 patch (p < 0.05 compared with the controls). Microscopic examination showed complete absorption of the APP 2 patches as well as quicker mucosal and extracellular matrix repair than controls. The APP 1 patch gave the best healing of the muscular layer but did not reduce anastomosis stricturing, and was not totally absorbed. Conclusions: Collagen supporting devices do not alter healing of the large bowel. Encircling patches do not increase the number of adhesions or the rate of anastomotic stricturing and a thin fibrillar collagen I + III dense layer may even improve it. The speed of absorption of the patch depends on the type of dense collagen film. These results argue for a prospective clinical evaluation in humans.","IRCAD,EUROPEAN INST TELESURG,STRASBOURG,FRANCE; HOP CIVIL,CHIRURG CLIN A,F-67091 STRASBOURG,FRANCE; IMEDEX SA,SADUC BIOMAT,CHAPONOST,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,10,10,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) known as poly(HEMA) has a number of limitations as a biomaterial, which is illustrated in its use as soft contact lenses where, even though it is found to be mechanically adequate, ocular incompatibility is observed leading ultimately to the formation of ''white spot deposits'' on the lens surface. Hydrogels synthesized during this study are polyethylene oxide modified poly(HEMA) based gels.

The merits of such treatments are, however, strongly dependent on the process parameters. In the present work the possibilities, limitations, and risks of plasma treatment for surface preparation of metallic materials are investigated experimentally using titanium as a model system, and also discussed in more general terms. Samples were treated by different low-pressure direct current plasmas and analyzed using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and light microscopy. The plasma system is a home-built, ultra-high vacuum-compatible system that allows sample introduction via a load-lock, and precise control of pressure, gas composition and flow rate, etc. This system allows uniform treatment of cylindrical and screw-shaped samples. With appropriate plasma parameters, argon plasma remove all chemical traces from former treatments (adsorbed contaminants and other impurities, and native oxide layers), in effect producing cleaner and more well-controlled surfaces than with conventional preparation methods. Removal (sputtering) rates up to 30 nm/min are possible. However, when inappropriate plasma parameters are used, the result may be increased contamination and formation of unintentional or undesired surface layers (e.g., carbides and nitrides). Plasma-cleaned surfaces provide a clean and reproducible starting condition for further plasma treatments to form well-controlled surface layers. Oxidation in pure O-2 (thermally or in oxygen plasmas) results in uniform and stoichiometric TiO2 surface oxide layers of reproducible composition and thicknesses in the range 0.5-150 nm, as revealed by AES and XPS analyses. Titanium nitride layers were prepared by using N-2 plasmas. While mild plasma treatments leave the surface microstructure unaffected, heavy plasma treatment can give rise to dramatic morphologic changes. Comparison of these results with corresponding analyses of commercial implants and electropolished and/or anodically oxidized samples shows that the plasma treatment offers superior control of the surface status. However, it is also shown that improper control of the plasma process can produce unwanted and irreproducible results.

In the present study, to develop a drug delivery system with higher bioacitivity in hard tissues by using the self-setting bioactive carbonate apatite cement, we have investigated the effects of sodium bicarbonate content on the in vitro drug release from a self-setting bioactive carbonate apatite cement containing indomethacin (IMC). Methods. The cement powder systems constituted an equimolar mixture of tetracalcium phosphate (Ca-4(PO4)(2)O) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4 . 2H(2)O), hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) seed crystals and sodium bicarbonate. Two types of 2% IMC loaded-cements were prepared as follows, one containing 0% HAP seed crystal and 0-10% sodium bicarbonate, and the other containing 40% HAP seed crystal and 0-10% sodium bicarbonate. The drug release profiles from 2% IMC loaded-cements were measured in simulated body fluid at pH 7.25 and 37.0 degrees C. Results, The drug release profiles from the cement matrix systems with or without seed crystals were estimated using a moment analysis computer program. The mean drug release time (MDT) and the time required for 50% drug release of the cement containing 0 and 40% seed crystal decreased with an increase of sodium bicarbonate. Furthermore, after the drug release the total pore volume of the cement matrix, as measured by mercury porosimetry, increased with an increase of sodium bicarbonate. Conclusions. MDT and T-50's were a function of adding the amount of sodium bicarbonate. The results of the relationship between the micropore distribution, total volume of pores after drug release and drug release supported the hypothesis that the variation in drug release from the cements resulting from the addition of sodium bicarbonate was mainly due to an increase in the diffusion of the drug in the micropores of the cement by dissolution or erosion of the cement matrix.","UNIV UTAH,DEPT PHARMACEUT & PHARMACEUT CHEM,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112","Otsuka, M (reprint author), KOBE UNIV,DEPT PHARMACEUT TECHNOL,MOTOYAMA KITAMACHI 4-19-1,KOBE,HYOGO 658,JAPAN.",,,,,,,19,12,14,1,7,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0724-8741,,,PHARMACEUT RES,Pharm.

Several unit operations can be applied, e.g. filtration, centrifugation and ultrafiltration. On a production scale at DSM, filtration was used to separate the biocatalyst, but its performance was not satisfactory. Therefore, research was carried out in order to improve filtration and to develop an alternative separation process, in this case ultrafiltration, In filtration the use of a body feed of filter aid is required to avoid formation of a slimy layer of cells and cell debris on the filter cloth, which would cause a dramatic decrease in the filtration rate. A precoat of filter aid proved not to be necessary. The porous cake formed by gradual deposition of filter aid on the filter favours a high filtration rate and retention of biomaterials. The best results were obtained with a high grade of perlite, at a concentration of 10 to 15 kg/m(3) for a biocatalyst concentration of 4.3 kg/m(3). The observed average filtration rate for a batch time of 80 min and at a pressure of 2.5 bar was 580 kg/m(2) h. The filtrate was not entirely clear: the protein retention was 50%. This means that the proteins remaining in the filtrate must be removed in another process step, e.g, carbon adsorption. By means of ultrafiltration, a very clear permeate was obtained as all the cells, cell debris and enzymes were retained by the membrane (molecular weight cut-off 25 000 Da). The highest flux was observed at a high cross-flow velocity, 3.9 m/s. At low transmembrane pressure, 3.4 bar, the flux had approximately the same value as at 10.7 bar. From our experiments, it can be concluded that once a fouling or gel layer is formed, it is stable and it will not be removed by increasing the cross-flow velocity, lowering the pressure, etc. At a concentration factor of 10 and a batch time of 6 h the average flux observed was 25 kg/m(2) h. The protein retention was approximately 99%. The investment and operational costs are lower for ultrafiltration than for pressure filtration. However, due to a process alteration at a later date, neither an UF unit nor a filtration unit were required. The negative effects of the presence of enzymes and cell debris in the product solution were compensated by using carbon adsorption, which was already installed for the purification of the product.",,"Meindersma, GW (reprint author), DSM RES BV,BASE CHEM & HYDROCARBONS,POB 18,NL-6160 MD GELEEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,18,6,6,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Class V cavities were prepared and filled with different restorative materials in 20 healthy premolars to be extracted for orthodontic reasons. Teeth were extracted at different time intervals, fixed, demineralized, and embedded in paraffin. Six-micrometer-thick sections were cut serially and mounted on slides and every fifth section was stained using hematoxylin and eosin or Masson's trichrome, and served to localize the inflammatory reaction. The slides corresponding to the bulk of the inflammatory reaction were then used for immunohistochemical detection of the inflammatory cells using monoclonal antibodies: CD15 (granulocytes and histiocytes), CD45RO (T lymphocytes and monocytes), Pan-B cell (B lymphocytes, macrophages, and a subpopulation of T lymphocytes), CD45RA (B lymphocytes and monocytes), and EMA (plasma cells). The slides were observed and submitted to computerized image analysis using a SAMBA 2000 system for counting of the cells. The CD15, CD45RO, Pan-B-cell, and CD45RA antibodies positively stained the target cells, which could be counted with the computer. The EMA antibody did not permit staining of cells. These results indicate that polymorphonuclears, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes are present in inflamed human dental pulp. The immunologic detection of inflammatory cells followed by computerized image analysis allows an accurate characterization of pulpal pathology, and could be useful for the study of pulp reactions to restorative biomaterials.

A new oxide layer was grown by oxidation in nitric acid or by annealing at 700 degrees C in air. At this temperature, reaction with nitrogen is unlikely. The purity of the oxidized sheet-titanium surfaces was investigated by Auger spectroscopy. The composition of both surfaces was TiO2 with carbon impurities. The carbon content of the acid-oxidized titanium was 20 +/- 2%, and the carbon content of the heat-oxidized titanium was 14 +/- 2% The initial reactions of the TiO, surfaces with blood were investigated by short-time exposure to capillary blood and by detection of surface-adsorbed plasma proteins and cells with immunofluorescence. Antibodies specific to fibrinogen, complement factor Clq, prothrombin/thrombin, and platelet membrane antigen were used, and the fluorescence was quantitated by computer-aided image analysis. The results show that serine proteases are the dominating proteins adsorbed onto annealed titanium (Clq = 67 +/- 4.6; pt/t = 97 +/- 0.2; fib = 47 +/- 0.2). The adsorption of serine proteases was lower and the amount of fibrinogen was higher on the acid-oxidized surface (Clq = 46.3 +/- 2.6; pt/t = 25 +/- 2.9; fib = 64 +/- 0.7). Platelets adhered and spread on the annealed titanium surface within 5 sec of blood-material contact. The number of adhering platelets was higher on the add-oxidized surface.

Crosslinking influences the mechanical properties, resorption kinetics, and biocompatibility of collagen-based biomaterials. In this study, we evaluated the effects of crosslinking on collagen fiber-fibroblast interactions in vitro. Collagen fibers were left untreated or crosslinked by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment (3 or 5 days), or hexamethylenediisocyanate (HMDIC) exposure. The initial attachment, proliferation (through 8 days), and morphology of human dermal fibroblasts were evaluated on control and crosslinked bundles of 200 collagen fibers in vitro. Initial attachment (number of fibroblasts at day 0) was increased on UV and DHT5-treated collagen fiber bundles. Fibroblast proliferation was similar for control, UV crosslinked, and DHT crosslinked fibers. In contrast, fibroblast attachment was significantly decreased and proliferation was delayed on HMDIC crosslinked fibers. These results, coupled with our previous studies, suggest that UV crosslinking of collagen fibers provides a combination of biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and strength retention suitable for various tissue engineering applications.

In this study, the effect of the two most common sterilization techniques, ethylene oxide and gamma-irradiation (0.3, 1.1, 3.9, 6.4, 10.6 Mrad), was evaluated for a family of four structurally related tyrosine-derived polycarbonates and for poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). The four polycarbonates were poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), poly(DTH carbonate), and poly(DTO carbonate) and differed only in the length of the pendent chain. Ethylene oxide exposure had little effect on molecular weight, surface composition, mechanical properties, or degradation rate of all test polymers except for poly(DTO carbonate). Poly(DTO carbonate) was unique since following ethylene oxide exposure it degraded faster than did the nonsterilized control. gamma-Irradiated tyrosine-derived polycarbonates retained over 81% of their initial molecular weight when exposed to a clinically relevant dose of 3.9 Mrad and retained still 58% of the initial molecular weight when exposed to the highest test dose of 10.6 Mrad. No changes in surface composition and only slight changes in yield strength and the Young's modulus were detected for any of the tyrosine-derived polycarbonates following gamma-irradiation. In vitro, irradiated films of poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), and poly(DTH carbonate) degraded at approximately the same rate as did the nonsterilized films regardless of irradiation dose. Only poly(DTO carbonate), irradiated at high doses, degraded faster than did the control. Medical-grade PLLA was tested under identical conditions. Ethylene oxide exposure of PLLA did not affect the molecular weight, surface composition, mechanical properties, or in vitro degradation rate. However, upon irradiation at 10.6 Mrad, PLLA retained only 29% of its initial molecular weight; a dose of 3.9 Mrad resulted in retention of 49% of the initial molecular weight. In correspondence with earlier publications, irradiation of PLLA induced significant losses in the Young's modulus, % strain at break, and changes in the postirradiation rate of degradation in some specimens. Compared to PLLA, tyrosine-derived polycarbonates are significantly more stable to gamma-irradiation and can be sterilized by conventional gamma-sterilization techniques.

While it is generally accepted that the surface topography of an implant influences the formation of bone and affects its performance, few systematic studies have dealt with this important feature. Quantification of the mineralized tissue at the implant interface has typically been attempted using histologic methods or conventional radiographic procedures. However, histologic methods are often technically demanding and time consuming, whereas conventional radiographic procedures lack resolution and sensitivity to identify small areas of mineralization. The objective of this study was to study systematically the effects of micromachined surfaces on bone formation by applying digital radiographic techniques to identify and quantify mineralized tissue. Titanium-coated epoxy replicas of 19 different micromachined grooved or pitted surfaces that ranged between 30 and 120 mu m deep, as well as smooth control surfaces, were implanted percutaneously and fixed to the parietal bone of rats. After 8 weeks the implants and attached tissue were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy. A total of 316 implant surfaces were processed, radiographed using conventional and digital techniques, and sectioned for histologic observations. The area of the bonelike tissue and its density were calculated using National Institutes of Health Image software. Mineralization was frequently noted at the interface of some types of micromachined surface but rarely on smooth surfaces. The presence of bone in histologic sections and areas identified as bone through digital radiography and image processing correlated strongly. The frequency of bonelike foci formation decreased as the depth of the grooves increased. In contrast, mineralization occurred more frequently as the depth of the pit increased. In addition, bonelike foci were oriented along the long axis of the grooves. It is thus feasible that the bonelike tissue is shaped, directed, or engineered to a predetermined configuration which is dictated by the surface topography. This study indicated that surface topography influences the frequency as well as the amount of bone deposited adjacent to implants, and mineralized product can be guided by the surface topography. Moreover, digital radiography and image processing can be used reliably to identify and quantify mineralized tissue at the implant interface.

Its anatomical structure was investigated and its mechanical properties were measured and compared with those of some common bone-bonding or bone-repairing biomaterials. It is found that, among all kinds of biomaterials, bamboo has the closest modulus of elasticity to human long bone. The cytotoxicity of bamboo was tested using the agar overlay method before and after heat or chemical treatments. The results reveal that ethanol, methanol and toluene can remove toxic leachable components from bamboo to some extent through extraction. After grafting a polymer whose molecule includes poly(ethylene glycol), alpha,omega-di(aminopropyl)poly(ethylene glycol) 800 on bamboo, bamboo has the ability to form a calcium phosphate coating after being immersed in calcification solution (simulated body fluid and accelerated calcification solution). The characteristics and the morphology of the mineral formed on bamboo were studied by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

These molecules, as mediators of cell adhesion, could play a role in the modulation of adhesion on the biomaterials, therefore conditioning the response of tissues to implant. Twenty different cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in contact with knitted Dacron. Both HUVECs grown without the material and HUVECs incubated with endotoxin were used as control. After 24 h, the cell adhesion molecules PECAM-1, ELAM-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were evaluated on the cells by monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. After 24 h of contact with knitted Dacron, a significant decrease in the proportion of cells expressing PECAM-1 was observed, as well as a significant increase in the proportion of cells expressing ELAM-1. The contact with knitted Dacron did not induce significant variations of ICAM-1 and VACM-1. The incubation with endotoxin determined a significant increase in the proportion of ELAM-1-positive cells, a significant increase in ICAM-1 fluorescence intensity, and a significant increase both in fluorescence intensity and in the proportion of VCAM-1-positive cells. The results obtained with the endotoxin are in agreement with those reported in the literature. The ELAM-1 increase, observed after contact with knitted Dacron, could favour leucocyte adhesion, while the decrease in PECAM-1 expression could result from an inhibiting effect on the endothelial cell adhesion so as to hinder the mechanisms involved in the endothelialization of the material. The variations were interpreted as inhibiting endothelialization and favouring the leucocyte adhesion effect by knitted Dacron.

This study examines the influence of surface properties on the adherence of the respiratory isolates Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to PVC. In particular, the influence of respiratory tract physiological conditions, 5% CO2 and saliva, on adherence was investigated. In general, decreased adherence to PVC was observed when bacteria were grown in CO2. When these CO2-grown bacteria were treated with saliva their adherence to PVC significantly increased; however, their adherence was significantly reduced to saliva-treated PVC. Treatment of both bacterial isolates with saliva decreased their negative zeta potential, a factor which may directly contribute to the observed increased microbial (saliva pretreated) adherence to PVC. Cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) was evaluated by measuring the initial rates of microbial removal from a buffered aqueous phase, to ensure the absence of electrostatic interactions, to an organic phase (xylene). Under physiological conditions, CSH did not appear to be a dominant factor in biomaterial adherence as the CSH of S. aureus was decreased by saliva treatment but was unchanged for Ps. aeruginosa. Additionally, CSH also differed for the two isolates when grown in CO2, significantly decreasing with S. aureus but remaining unaltered with Ps. aeruginosa. Saliva treatment of PVC also decreased the advancing and receding contact angles of the biomaterial and its surface roughness, which may be a factor in the decreased adherence of saliva-treated bacteria to this surface. Alternative biomaterials or surface modifications appear necessary for the desired improvements in ET tube effectiveness. This study highlights the influence of physiological conditions on biomaterial and bacterial surface characteristics and subsequent interactions. It is imperative that the physiological conditions predominating in the clinical area of biomaterial use be considered when investigating device biocompatibility.

Materials and methods Pre-cut segments of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) prostatic stents were incubated with two common uropathogenic bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) with and without previous immersion in antibiotic solution. Tobramycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin solutions were used, as these antibiotics are commonly administered for the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). Results Immersion in ciprofloxacin solution prevented the adherence of both bacterial strains, Immersion in ceftriaxone solution prevented only the adherence of the E, coli strain. Immersion in tobramycin solution had no effect on either of the strains. The stent materials per se did not influence bacterial adhesion, After immersion in ciprofloxacin, the stent segments retained significant antibacterial activity even after one day's incubation in saline. Conclusion Immersion in a suitable antibiotic solution may significantly reduce and even prevent bacterial adhesion onto biodegradable prostatic stents. Preventing bacterial adhesion may reduce the risk of UTI during the use of these devices.","UNIV BARI,SCH MED,I-70121 BARI,ITALY; UNIV HELSINKI,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; TAMPERE UNIV TECHNOL,INST PLAST TECHNOL,FIN-33101 TAMPERE,FINLAND; PAIJAT HAME CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,LAHTI,FINLAND",,,,,,,,15,13,13,0,5,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0007-1331,,,BRIT J UROL,Br.

Methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (MPEG sulfonate)-modified chitosan was prepared by allowing the base polymer to swell in an acidic medium, followed by polyelectrolyte complexation and interpenetration of MPEG sulfonate with the chitosan matrix. Addition of a strong base collapsed the base polymer to permanently immobilize the modifying agent on the surface. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) confirmed the presence of MPEG sulfonate on chitosan and the high resolution Cls peak showed an increase in -C-O- which is indicative of the ethylene oxide residues. The number of adherent platelets and the extent of platelet activation was significantly reduced on MPEG sulfonate-modified chitosan. Compared to an average of more than 66 fully activated platelets on unmodified chitosan surface, only 3.0 contact-adherent platelets were present on MPEG sulfonate-modified chitosan. Plasma recalcification time, a measure of the intrinsic coagulation reaction, was about 11.5 min in contact with modified chitosan. The results of this study show that chitosan surface can be modified by the complexation-interpenetration method with anionic PEG derivative. Surface-immobilized MPEG sulfonate was effective in preventing plasma protein adsorption and platelet adhesion and activation by the steric repulsion mechanism.

To assess the interfacial bonding strength, this study examined a fracture mechanics approach using a bilayer compact sandwich (BCS) specimen, in which a bilayer coupon comprising the interface between tissue and biomaterial was sandwiched between two holders. First, the theoretical basis for measuring interfacial fracture toughness using the BCS specimen was developed. Next, the effect of finite interlayer thickness on the measurements was addressed and a correction factor was determined using finite element analysis techniques. Accordingly, the theoretical solution was modified to account for the effect of the interlayer thickness. Finally, using a bone to bone-cement interface the BCS technique was empirically verified in terms of overall size, material combination, and interlayer thickness. It is expected that the BCS technique will provide an effective means for researchers to study and analyze tissue-biomaterial interfaces.

The ISO gives the standard requirements for testing biomaterials provided for implantation. Our primary interest was the establishment of a reliable in vitro panel as a useful and relevant screening system for vascular implant devices to evaluate blood/device interactions under flow conditions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate influences of different flow conditions on blood cell-biomaterial interactions with special emphasis on the interactions of human granulocytes (PMN) and polymeric surfaces. PMN were isolated and vital cells were quantified by flow cytometrical analysis directly before, as well as immediately after the experiments. The viscosity of the final cellular suspension was analysed by using a computerized cone-plate rheometer. As reference materials we used FEP-teflon, PVC-DEHD, PU, PP and PE. Dacron and ePTFE synthetic vascular protheses were tested in a comparative way to those references. The adhesion processes were observed over a period of 40 minutes under arterial (shear stress 0.74 Pa) and venous (shear stress 0.16 Pa) flow conditions in a parallel plate flow chamber system under highly standardized conditions and laminar flow. The cells were observed with the help of inverse light microscopy. Cell behaviour was recorded and analysed in both analogue (video) and digital (imaging system) modes. Samples of the cell suspensions were obtained at regular time intervals and analysed by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify LTB(4) release. Irrespective of the material, approximately 3 to 4 times more PMN adhered to the biomaterial surfaces under venous flow conditions compared to the arterial. Shear intensity did not influence the running order of biomaterials with respect to cell numbers. This response in descending order at the end of the experiments was as follows: PU, PVC-DEHD, PP, PE and ePTFE. The biochemical analyses indicate that in the system used only a weak effect on LTB(4) release induced by the different materials could be determined. A significant effect caused by flow conditions was not observed.

Important aspects of interfacial biology, including the underlying biological mechanisms and methodology, are presented. Of the latter the combination of morphological techniques with methods of cell and molecular biology as well as molecular genetics (so-called ''combinative techniques'') are particularly useful.

The prepared PEO-entrapped PMMA film surfaces were characterized by the measurement of water contact angle and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The stability of PEO entrapped in PMMA films was also examined by immersing the films in water for up to 7 days with continuous shaking and measuring the weight changes. The behavior of plasma protein adsorption and platelet adhesion on the PEO-entrapped PMMA film surfaces was investigated. It was observed that the plasma protein adsorption and platelet adhesion on the film surfaces decreased with increasing PEO molecular weight and its surface density.

While issues of national sovereignty are likely to present difficulties, the international medical device community shares fundamental goals, and the potential benefits to global harmonization are substantial. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is collaborating currently with international organizations on an approach to attain these goals, with excellent results. The devices approach to harmonization presented at the meetings of the Global Harmonization Task Force in June 1995 is described. FDA believes a stepwise approach to harmonization is an effective and efficient approach to making progress. To do this, all parties must agree on steps to achieve harmonization in each area. It is highly desirable that each country reach the same definitions of tissue and tissue-engineered products and jurisdictional assignments for regulatory review, avoiding overlaps, so that the industry can deal more economically with regulatory oversight. The controls that the FDA applies to tissue-engineered products are discussed as well as the need to determine which major consensus standards group can organize the development of global, not just European, standards for tissue-engineered products. The FDA pledges its support to work toward regulatory harmonization of these products.","US FDA,CTR DEVICES & RADIOL HLTH,ROCKVILLE,MD 20857",,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,2,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,SPR,1997.0,3,1,,,,,79,83,,10.1089/ten.1997.3.79,,,,5,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,XN989,WOS:A1997XN98900010,,,,,2019-02-25

These included differential granular wear (alumina grains and yttrium-stabilized alumina grains at different depths), multidirectional scratches with heaped up boundaries, and incompletely sintered grains, as well as the formation of craters and separation of grain boundaries. The femoral heads in this small series of revision cases show that yttrium-stabilized alumina ceramic heads may develop surface irregularities from either manufacturing processes or in vivo use.

The effects of implants on bony tissue have been investigated. The effects upon adjacent skeletal muscles have not been determined. The focus of this work is to elucidate the biological effects of various calcium phosphate bioceramics on skeletal muscles. Four different kinds of powder of calcium phosphate biomaterials including beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), hydroxyapatite (HA), beta-dicalcium pyrophosphate (beta-DCP) and sintered beta-dicalcium pyrophosphate (SDCP), were tested by myoblast cell cultures. The results were analyzed by cell count, cell morphology and concentration of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in culture medium. The cell population and TGF-beta 1 concentration of the control sample increased persistently as the time of culture increased. The changes in cell population and TGF-beta 1 concentration in culture medium of the beta-TCP and HA were quite low in the first 3 days of culture, then increased gradually toward the seventh day. The changes in cell population and TGF-beta 1 concentration in culture medium of the silica, beta-DCP, and SDCP were quite similar. They were lower during the first day of culture but increased and reached that of the control medium after 7 days' culture. Most cells on beta-TCP and HA diminished in size with radially spread, long pseudopods. We conclude that HA and beta-TCP are thought to have an inhibitory effect on growth of the myoblasts. The HA and beta-TCP may interfere with the repair and regeneration of injured skeletal muscle after orthopedic surgery.

We obtained cell growth only on samples previously immersed 15 or 22 days in complete culture medium. We describe a dissolution/precipitation phenomenon on the HA coating surface assessed by modifications of Ca and P concentrations in the culture medium, by the transformation of the HA coating into carbonated HA (X-ray diffraction and infrared spectrometry) and by the presence demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy of spherocrystallites on the HA after 15 days of immersion. Our results show that adult human bone-derived cells are apparently particularly sensitive to the changes in the coating surface induced by liquid immersion.

The bone-grafting material (HAS) was implanted into two adult patients, and small biopsies were recovered 6 months after implantation. The raw biomaterial was analyzed by x-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Six months after their implantation, the HAS aggregates were surrounded by a mineralized bone matrix. Tiny crystallites also filled the spaces between the HAS crystals within the aggregates. These newly formed crystallites growing at the surfaces of the implanted HAS crystals appeared to be apatitic. The crystallographic investigations of the nucleation and growing mechanisms of the newly formed crystallites were performed by HRTEM in association with computer simulation and mathematical processing of digitized images. A relationship was noted between the orientation axes of crystallites growing nearby and the zone axes of the implanted HAS, thus strongly suggesting a guiding or substratum role of the HAS particles.","INST GENET & BIOL MOL & CELLULAIRE, F-67404 ILLKIRCH GRAFFENSTADEN, FRANCE","Hemmerle, J (reprint author), INSERM, U424, FEDERAT RECH ODONTOL, 11 RUE HUMANN, F-67085 STRASBOURG, FRANCE.",,,,,,,29,13,14,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-0345,1544-0591,,J DENT RES,J.

In the present study, human alveolar bone cells were cultured in alpha-minimal essential medium (alpha-MEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 mu g/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate and either in the presence or in the absence of 10 nM dexamethasone (Dexa). Cultures were characterized concerning cell viability/proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP) and tartraric acid resistant phosphatase (TRAP) activities, and formation of mineralized areas. Cell proliferation increased gradually for approximately 20 days. In the presence of Dexa, cells formed isolated or interconnected multilayered clusters that increased with culture time. Histochemical assays revealed strong positive reactions for ALP and calcium and phosphates deposits, mainly in relation to cells associated with the clusters. High levels of ALP activity (biochemical determination) were observed. Cells cultured in the absence of Dexa showed significantly lower ALP activity and no calcium and phosphates deposits were present. Serially passaged cells kept the proliferation rate constant but a decrease in ALP activity was observed either in the presence or in the absence of Dexa. The ability to form mineralized areas (cultures fed with Dexa) also decreased on serial subculture.","INST CIENCIAS BIOMED ABEL SALAZAR,P-4000 OPORTO,PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO,P-4719 BRAGA,PORTUGAL; INEB,INST BIOMED ENGN,P-4000 OPORTO,PORTUGAL","Fernandes, MH (reprint author), FAC MED DENT,RUA DOUTOR ROBERTO FRIAS,P-4200 OPORTO,PORTUGAL.",,"Fernandes, Maria Helena/K-6917-2014; Carvalho, Graca S./M-5669-2015","Fernandes, Maria Helena/0000-0001-9391-9574; Carvalho, Graca S./0000-0002-0034-1329; Costa, Maria Adelina Coelho/0000-0001-7664-2075",,,,27,33,33,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

It is therefore essential to use a very sensitive index of toxicity. We have compared the sensitivity of four well-established indices of toxicity: total cell protein content, leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reduced glutathione content and the MTT assay, with that of a novel index, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Comparisons were made by detecting nickel chloride toxicity in osteoblasts. ALP activity, the novel method, proved the most sensitive index of toxicity and it provides a convenient automated assay for assessing the interactions of materials with osteoblasts. The responses to nickel chloride and to aqueous extracts prepared from carbon fibre reinforced epoxy and polyetheretherketone (peek), two candidate materials for orthopaedic implants, were compared in primary and immortalized rat osteoblasts, and in primary human osteoblasts. Although the immortalized rat osteoblast cell line, FFC, was consistently the most sensitive cell type, the responses of the human cells and the FFC cell line were similar in terms of ALP activity throughout the range of nickel concentrations studied. Neither peek nor epoxy material extracts showed a significant decrease in the MTT or ALP responses in any of the three cell types. Our data suggest that immortalized rat osteoblasts may provide an in vitro model system for screening the biocompatibility of orthopaedic polymers.","UNIV PAISLEY,DEPT BIOL SCI,PAISLEY PA1 2BE,RENFREW,SCOTLAND; KAROLINSKA HOSP,DEPT ORTHOPAED,S-10401 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","Macnair, R (reprint author), UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,WOLFSON CTR,106 ROTTENROW,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,23,33,38,1,6,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

To determine the cellular events occurring in the presence of HA, human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLF) were isolated and maintained in culture. The specificity of the cells was evidenced by their morphology, deposition of extracellular matrix components, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (as a marker of osteoblastic differentiation of HPLF). Phase-contrast investigations revealed morphological alterations of cells in contact with HA particles. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the phagocytotic process of HPLF toward HA particles. Moreover, the presence of HA particles was significantly related to an increase in the protein synthesis activity and a decrease in the proliferation and ALP-specific activity of HPLF. These results provide new information on the phenotypic expression of HPLF, which is comparable to that of osteoblastic cells. A subpopulation of HPLF may be influenced by the presence of HA to undergo transient dedifferentiation prior to redifferentiating into osteoblasts. This process may be important as a means by which HA acts as an osteoconductive material. This experimental study improves our understanding of the cellular processes which occur during healing and regeneration of periodontal defects after implantation of biomaterials.","ACAD CTR DENT AMSTERDAM,NL-1066 EA AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; INST BIOL,INSERM U419,NANTES,FRANCE","AlliotLicht, B (reprint author), FAC CHIRURG DENT,LAB RECH INTERDISCIPLINAIRE TISSUS CALCIFIES & BI,PL ALEXIS RICORDEAU,F-44042 NANTES,FRANCE.",,"GREGOIRE, Marc/G-2867-2013","GREGOIRE, Marc/0000-0003-3868-0198",,,,42,19,25,0,1,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Ordered arrangements of porous channels have been produced in silica-based materials by post-synthetic removal of surfactant templates from inorganic-organic mesostructures(6,7). The resulting pore sizes are commensurate with the packing dimensions of the organic molecules, and are currently limited to length scales of up to 10 nm. Here we show how a bacterial superstructure, consisting of a thread of coaligned multicellular filaments of Bacillus subtilis(8,9), can be used to extend the length scale of inorganic materials patterning, We produce ordered macroporous fibres of either amorphous silica or ordered mesoporous silica(6,7) (MCM-41) by template-directed mineralization of the interfilament spaces followed by removal of organic material by heating to 600 degrees C. The inorganic macrostructures consist of a macroporous framework of 0.5-mu m-wide channels with curved walls of either silica or mesoporous silica, 50 to 200 nm in thickness. The formation of ordered pores In the MCM-41 replica on both the mesoscopic and macroscopic length scales illustrates how supramolecular and supercellular templates might be combined for the fabrication of inorganic materials with structural hierarchy.","UNIV BATH,SCH CHEM,BATH BA2 7AY,AVON,ENGLAND; UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT MOL & CELLULAR BIOL,TUCSON,AZ 85721",,,"Mann, Stephen/D-1332-2012","Mann, Stephen/0000-0003-3012-8964",,,,23,560,576,5,135,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,JAN 30,1997.0,385,6615,,,,,420,423,,10.1038/385420a0,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WF007,WOS:A1997WF00700047,,,,,2019-02-25

Spectral heterogeneity in the 400 nm range, assumed to be associated with the M-intermediate state, previously characterized for films of 4-keto wild-type BR, was observed in the 4-keto D96N mutant BR. This heterogeneity is associated to a greater extent with chromophore replacement than with amino acid replacement. The time constants of the M-decay are larger for all kinetic components for 4-keto D96N mutant in the absence of sodium azide. In addition, the contribution of the most long-lived component of the M-state decay is almost twice as large as for the film without sodium azide as it is for a film with sodium azide. This sodium azide effect on the M-state decay kinetics is opposite to that observed in the 4-keto wild-type BR.

The decreasing amount of calcium concentration in SBF during the drug release increased with increase of time. This was attributed to in vitro precipitation and/or growth of hydroxyapatite on the cement. The plasma IMC concentration and the area under the curve (AUG) from 1, 2 and 5% IMC-loaded cements after s.c. administration in rat depended on the loaded LMC concentration in the cements.

The PLGA polymers degrade by bulk hydrolysis of ester bonds and breakdown into their constituent monomers, lactic and glycolic acids which are excreted from the body. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of manufacturing procedure on the in vitro degradation of two PLGA copolymers, 85:15 and 50:50, which were fabricated as implants, Implants were compressed from microcapsules prepared by nonsolvent induced phase separation using two solvent-nonsolvent systems, viz., methylene chloride-hexane (non-polar) and acetone-phosphate buffer (polar). Studies were performed at pH 4.5, 7.4 and 9.4 and polymer degradation was monitored by measuring the decrease in number- and weight-average molecular weights (M(n) and M(w)), mass loss, formation of lactic and glycolic acids and pH of the degradation medium. Representative scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) were also obtained to study the changes in surface morphology of the implants. Results of these studies indicated that both PLGA 85:15 and 50:50 implants prepared by the non-polar procedure degraded faster than the implants prepared by the polar procedure. The decrease in polymer M(n) and M(w) followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Changes in M(n) and M(w) occurred before the onset of mass loss, after which implant mass loss was described by pseudo first order kinetics. The appearance of lactic and glycolic acids corresponded to the initiation of mass loss and also resulted in decrease in pH of the bulk degradation medium. The SEMs indicated that water uptake was faster in implants prepared by the non-polar method resulting in a more porous matrix which degrades more rapidly. Finally, the average degradation time for PLGA 85:15 was approximate to 26 weeks and that for PLGA 50:50 was 6-8 weeks.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,MED CTR,DRUG INFORMAT & EPIDEMIOL CTR,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV NEBRASKA,MED CTR,COLL PHARM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,OMAHA,NE 68105","Ramchandani, M (reprint author), INTEGRA LIFESCI CORP,105 MORGAN LANE,PLAINSBORO,NJ 08536, USA.",,,,,,,19,45,47,2,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-3659,,,J CONTROL RELEASE,J.

In physiological solutions it is able to self-assemble to form a macroscopic matrix that stains with Congo red. On raising the temperature of the aqueous solution above 70 degrees C, an abrupt structural transition occurs in the CD spectra from a beta-sheet to a stable alpha-helix without a detectable random-coil intermediate. With cooling, it retained the alpha-helical form and took several weeks at room temperature to partially return to the beta-sheet form. Slow formation of the stable beta-sheet structure thus shows kinetic irreversibility. Such a formation of very stable beta-sheet structures is found in the amyloid of a number of neurological diseases. This oligopeptide could be a model system for studying the protein conformational changes that occurs in scrapie or Alzheimer disease. The abrupt and direct conversion from a beta-sheet to an alpha-helix may also be found in other processes, such as protein folding and protein-protein interaction.

Epi-fluorescence microscopy shows that the enzyme remains active. The enzyme retention was investigated in the conditions of enzyme activity detection by immersion of the protein-lipid LB films in the suitable alkaline buffer. This study showed that the interactions between the enzyme and either the head or the tail groups of behenic acid were strong enough to avoid enzyme desorption during overnight immersion in the buffer. Furthermore, the retained enzyme preserves the structure of the behenic acid multilayers during their immersion in the alkaline buffer; transformation into behenate multilayers which normally occurs if the enzyme is not present. This protecting role of the GlDH molecules against the modification of the behenic acid multilayer structure, probably contributes to a slowing down of the hydration of the underlaying layers by the buffer.","UNIV LYON 1,LAB GENIE ENZYMAT,CNRS,UPRESA 5013,F-69622 VILLEURBANNE,FRANCE",,,,"Girard-Egrot, Agnes/0000-0003-2612-3124",,,,18,32,34,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,JAN 5,1997.0,292,1-2,,,,,282,289,,10.1016/S0040-6090(96)08954-7,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,WK359,WOS:A1997WK35900045,,,,,2019-02-25

Single bubble sonoluminescence produces much more symmetric bubble collapse with subsequently much higher effective temperatures during collapse. In cold liquids, bubble cloud cavitation is able to drive reactions that normally occur only under extreme conditions. Examples include activation of liquid-solid reactions and synthesis of amorphous and nanophase metals, and the synthesis of novel biomaterials, especially protein microspheres.

After 24 hours perfusion, the differences in protein exposition between heparinized and unheparinized polymers were substantially reduced.","LUND UNIV, DEPT MED MICROBIOL, S-22362 LUND, SWEDEN; LUND INST TECHNOL, DEPT SOLID STATE PHYS, LUND, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT LAB MED, S-10401 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT MED, S-10401 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; UNIV LUND HOSP, DEPT NEUROSURG, S-22185 LUND, SWEDEN",,,"Tegenfeldt, Jonas/B-9506-2008; Montelius, Lars/B-9071-2008","Tegenfeldt, Jonas/0000-0002-3695-6886; Montelius, Lars/0000-0001-9563-2307",,,,50,10,10,0,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0001-6268,,,ACTA NEUROCHIR,Acta Neurochir.,,1997.0,139,8,,,,,734,742,,10.1007/BF01420046,,,,9,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,XT967,WOS:A1997XT96700015,9309288.0,,,,2019-02-25

Since 1970, devices, tissues, and records have been evaluated with the total now exceeding 3,800 devices. Most of these explants have been from orthopaedic and oral surgical procedures. The studies have been protocol driven with the magnitudes of each investigation separated into three tiers. Tier one includes anticipated outcomes, tier two isolates those situations where changes are noted but are judged not to have influenced the clinical outcome, while tier three is specific to unanticipated outcomes or areas of interest related to research and development projects. Results. from these studies have demonstrated considerable value, and observations can always be reported with confidence. However, to determine cause-effect relationships, hypotheses must be developed from the observations and more in-depth physical and biological science-based investigations conducted to establish validity and statistical significance. Examples where observations from explanted devices have resulted in analyses that have influenced the device design and material selections include: (1) corrosion and biodegradation of metallic alloys; (2) device surface coatings for functional attachments to bone; (3) minimization of wear for articulating surfaces of total joint arthroplasties (THAs), and (4) synthetic matrices for tissue augmentation and regeneration. Studies of the biodegradation of metallic materials stemmed from observations of enhanced corrosion due to galvanic coupling within dental implant constructs. Subsequent in vitro electrometric evaluations of corrosion have been quantitatively predictive and alloy combinations can now be selected to minimize biocorrosion phenomena. Investigations into the causes of biomechanical fracture and biochemical dissolution of first generation calcium phosphate coatings on metallic dental and orthopaedic devices has now resulted in enhanced technology to produce higher quality coatings with controlled properties that meet recently established national standards. The quantification of articulating surface wear of polyethylene components within TJA has caused a re-emphasis of alternate bearing materials and metal-on-metal plus ceramic-on-ceramic devices now being evaluated after longer-term implantation periods (10-20 year follow-up). Longer-term analyses of various synthetic material matrices used as scaffolds and fillets within bone grafts are now providing key insights into how these compositions and forms have been tolerated in vivo. This information is now proving to be a key resource for the selection(s) of appropriate biomaterials for combinations with active macromolecular substances or stem cells intended to directly influence tissue regeneration. Methods for conducting a program for the analysis of retrieved surgical implants will be reviewed and examples discussed to show how these types of studies have significantly influenced the reconstructive surgical discipline.","UNIV ALABAMA, SCH DENT, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA; UNIV ALABAMA, SCH MED, DEPT BIOMAT, DIV ORTHOPAED SURG, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA","Lemons, JE (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA, SCH MED,DEPT SURG,1919 7TH AVE S,RM 616, SDB BOX 29, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA.",,,,,,,40,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER IBERICA,BARCELONA,"PROVENZA 388, E-08025 BARCELONA, SPAIN",1130-2283,,,AN QUIM-INT,An.

The poor results of these vascular grafts may be attributed to the fixatives, aldehydes, used in fixing tissues. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a new fixative, epoxy compound, has recently been used to fix biological vascular grafts. The study was undertaken to investigate the crosslinking characteristics, fixation index and denaturation temperature, of various porcine arteries fixed with an epoxy compound. The porcine arteries investigated in the study were the common carotid artery, internal thoracic artery, abdominal aorta, and saphenous artery. In addition, the effects of sonication on the porcine arteries before fixation on their cross-linking characteristics were analyzed. The fresh and glutaraldehyde-fixed arteries were used as controls. It was noted that glycine, proline, and alanine were the most abundant amino acids found in the porcine internal thoracic artery. In the amino acid analysis, it was observed that the amino acids in the porcine arteries reacted with epoxy compound or glutaraldehyde were lysine, hydroxylysine, histidine, and arginine. Of these amino acids, lysine was the most reactive. In general, the fixed arteries were relatively stiffer than their fresh counterparts. The fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of various porcine arteries were comparable throughout the entire fixation process. The amounts of free amino groups of the sonicated arteries were significantly lower than those of their unsonicated counterparts (p < 0.05). It is speculated that the diminishing free amino groups of the sonicated arteries may be attributed to the removal of the destroyed cell debris and adherent proteins of the arteries after sonication. However, it was learned that sonication on the porcine arteries before fixation did not seem to affect their fixation indices and denaturation temperatures. The results obtained in this study may help one in selecting the raw materials for developing a small-diameter biological vascular graft.","VET GEN HOSP,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,TAIPEI,TAIWAN; PIG RES INST,DEPT COMPARAT MED,TAIPEI,TAIWAN","Sung, HW (reprint author), NATL CENT UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,CHUNGLI 32054,TAIWAN.",,,,,,,34,9,9,0,6,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Drug release rates, bacterial colonization and morphological features of the polymer-ciprofloxacin combinations were studied and the physico-chemical mechanisms of the delivery were discussed. Ciprofloxacin salt showed a fast initial release rare, whereas ciprofloxacin-betaine was characterized by a more continuous release behaviour. A higher diffusity of the lipophilic ciprofloxacin-betaine in the polymer could be shown as compared to its salt incorporated into the polyurethane. The high initial burst effect of the hydrochloride antibiotic was caused by its high solubility in the elution medium. Bacterial colonization tb the antibiotic-loaded polyurethanes was inhibited effectively only by preparations showing a slower but more sustained drug release. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that the polyurethane-antibiotic combination was most homogenous for ciprofloxacin-betaine. Polyurethane material loaded with ciprofloxacin salt showed crystals at the surface and a granular structure of the polymeric matrix. Crystalline structure of the drug on polymeric surfaces varied with loading concentration and lipophilicity. Physico-chemical similarity of the polymeric material and the antibiotics is important for the homogeneity of the polymer-antibiotic combinations. High homogeneity is required for a sustained and prolonged release and effective inhibition of bacterial colonization.","UNIV TECHNOL,RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,DEPT ANESTHESIOL,D-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY; UNIV COLOGNE,INST MED MICROBIOL & HYG,D-5000 COLOGNE 41,GERMANY","Schierholz, JM (reprint author), B BRAUN MELSUNGEN AG,FORSCH & ENTWICKLUNG,NURNBERGER STR 55,D-34212 MELSUNGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,20,22,22,0,4,ECV-EDITIO CANTOR VERLAG MEDIZIN NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,AULENDORF,"BANDELSTOCKWEG 20, POSTFACH 1255, D-88322 AULENDORF, GERMANY",0004-4172,,,ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCH,Arzneimittelforschung,JAN,1997.0,47,1,,,,,70,74,,,,,,5,"Chemistry, Medicinal; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Chemistry,WG945,WOS:A1997WG94500014,9037447.0,,,,2019-02-25

Experimental variables included surface treatments of CPT and porcelain firing schedules. Variables for the surface treatments were (1) sandblasting, (2) mono- and triple-layered nitridation, and (3) mono-layered chrome-doped nitridation. Variables for the porcelain firing schedule included (4) bonding agent application, (5) bonding agent plus gold bonding agent application, and (6) Procera porcelain application. All together eleven sample groups were prepared with different combination of aforementioned experimental variables. Statistically all of them exhibited no significant differences. Hence, we employed two further criteria; (I) the minimum bond strength should exceed the maximum porcelain strength per se, and (II) the CPT substrate should not be heated close to the beta-transus temperature. After applying these criteria, it was concluded that mono-layered nitridation and mono-layered application of chrome-doped nitridation on both (with and without) sandblasted and non-sandblasted surfaces were the most promising conditions for a successful Titanium-Porcelain System.","INDIANA UNIV,SCH DENT,DEPT RESTORAT DENT,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202",,,,,,,,53,26,28,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

Human lymphocytes were cultured in semi-physiological medium which had been previously exposed to biomaterial extracts of commercially pure titanium following ISO standards. In order to visualize the location of induced DNA strand breaks, cells were then exposed to exonuclease III which partially digests and amplifies lesions by releasing nucleotides at free 3' hydroxyl ends from nicked double-stranded DNA. The resulting single-stranded DNA was allowed to hybridize with short oligonucleotides of random sequences including biotinylated dUTP. After random priming using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, incorporation of biotin-dUTP was detected by immunogold binding to the chromatin. Cells exposed to a mutagenic concentration of methyl methanesulfonate, as a positive control, showed a significantly higher and stronger gold staining than both titanium-exposed and unexposed specimens. This assay allows a precise localization and quantification of both in vitro DNA breakage and DNA repair. It could provide a powerful tool for rapid assessment of the genotoxic potential of new biomaterials.","Univ Montreal, Pediat Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; Univ Montreal, Dept Surg, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; Univ Montreal, Dept Pathol, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada; Hop St Justine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada",,assad@justine.umontreal.ca,,"Assad, Michel/0000-0001-8734-0267",,,,37,5,5,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

This work focusses on two polymers that contain covalently bound iodine, rendering the materials radio-opaque. The first material is hard, transparent and glass-like, and consists of methyl methacrylate, 2-(2'-iodobenzoyl)-ethyl methacrylate (1) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), in the molar ratio 65:20:15, respectively. The second material is a cross-linked hydrophilic network, consisting of HEMA and 1, in the molar ratio 80:20, respectively. Both materials were characterized by means of different physico-chemical techniques, including magic-angle-spinning solid state NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, both materials were implanted subcutaneously in rats for 24 days. Upon explantation and histological examination, it appeared that both materials are well tolerated. No tissue necrosis, abscess formation or inflammation were observed. The samples were found to be surrounded by a vascularized capsule consisting of connective tissue cells. The results reveal excellent tissue compatibility for both materials. This is an important observation, since tissue compatibility is absolutely necessary for the applications which are foreseen for this type of radio-opaque biomaterials.

In this work the intensity of phagocytosis of carbon fibres obtained by carbonization of polyacrylonitrile was studied both for HNO3 etched and non-etched fibres. Part of the powdered material studied was placed in plasma before it was contacted with cells. To study the material, which was first placed in plasma and then contacted with cells, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used. It was found that the powders made from the etched fibres are phagocytized more intensively. It was also found that the absorption of plasma proteins enhances the phagocytosis only for the fibres oxidized in HNO3 and has no influence in the case of powders obtained from non-etched fibres.

On this material, rat bone cells were visible in Ivac mode only in cells traversing pores, when they were readily identified by their cell nuclei. Rat calvarial bone examined uncoated in Ivac mode showed the bone structure clearly through the overlying layer of osteoblast cells, which were subsequently revealed by gold coating. Immunogold labelling of alkaline phosphatase was imaged in Ivac mode, following silver enhancement and carbon coating.

Histological and histometric evaluation of trial areas adjacent to the implants showed that by week 1 the glass-ionomer granules were encircled by a conspicuous capsule surrounded by immature connective tissue. By week 3 the implants were surrounded by a less prominent fibrous capsule and most of the tested area was occupied by mature trabecular bone. By week 6 the fibrous capsule was thinner and the tested area was almost totally covered by bone, which was in close contact with the implanted material in several places. Quantitative data confirmed progressive new bone formation in parallel with a decrease in the percentage fraction of connective tissue in the trial areas around the implants. The results revealed that the tested material is biologically compatible, being progressively incorporated into alveolar bone in the wound healing process. The quantitative evaluation of alveolar wound healing around a glass-ionomer implant may provide an experimental model for future comparative studies carried out with other biomaterials.

Moreover, dipyridamole is essentially non-toxic. The drug is used extensively in clinical anti-coagulation regimes, for example pre- and post-coronary angioplasty procedures. Recently, we have found that photochemical, covalent coupling of dipyridamole to polyurethane surfaces leads to improved thromboresistance in vitro. This phenomenon is now studied in more detail. Both qualitative and more quantitative biochemical experiments were performed in order to characterize the in vitro blood compatibility of a set of polyurethane surfaces onto which dipyridamole was immobilized. First, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphology of platelets which adhered during incubation with platelet-rich plasma. These experiments showed that immobilization of dipyridamole leads to a clearly decreased number of adherent platelets and to a largely diminished propensity of the surface to activate adherent platelets. Secondly, an in vitro thrombogenicity assay was run. These experiments showed that the thromboresistance increased with increasing surface density of immobilized dipyridamole. A short spacer chain, separating dipyridamole from the polymer surface, was found to improve the thromboresistance further. Such a spacer chain apparently increases the efficacy of the immobilized drug. Collectively, the present results further substantiate the idea that dipyridamole retains its inhibitory activity with respect to activation and aggregation of blood platelets, when the compound is covalently attached to a polymer surface. The possible utility of these findings with respect to the development of an artificial blood vessel prosthesis is discussed briefly.

Four stages are identified: supramolecular preorganization and spatial patterning; interfacial molecular recognition in inorganic nucleation; vectorial crystallization; and pattern evolution and hierarchy. Each of these concepts can be translated into synthetic approaches to the formation of inorganic materials with organized architectures. An example of applying this biomimetic paradigm is described. Supersaturated water-in-oil microemulsions have been used to synthesize microskeletal calcium phosphates by controlled nucleation and vectorial growth in constrained reaction environments.

In the last five years it has been widely recognised that UHMWPE wear debris generated from the articulating surfaces of total artificial joints is a major cause of osteolysis and failure in these devices. The adverse cellular reactions that cause loosening are controlled by the number and type of UHMWPE wear particles generated by the different wear processes and tribological designs. The E.C. has funded a Brite Euram Project to investigate wear of UHMWPE, which involves experimental and theoretical investigations of wear processes, quantification of wear debris, analysis of cellular reactions to particles that cause bone resorption and prediction of tribological design solutions that can reduce the adverse cellular reactions and osteolysis. In this paper we present one aspect of the project which is a new method to isolate and quantify polyethylene wear debris from biological solutions and tissues, which analyses the mass and frequency distribution of the particles as a function of size in the range 0.1 mu m to 1000 mu m. The results show that analysis of the particle frequency distribution is not adequate to differentiate between different types of debris or to quantify the total number of particles. The analysis of the mass distribution as a function of particle size not only differentiates between different types of debris but can also allow the quantification of the total number of particles generated per unit mass of debris. For typical clinical wear volumes, this analysis predicts between 50 and 900 x 10(9) wear particles per year. Identification of tribological designs that can reduce this burden on the biological tissue is critically important.",,"Fisher, J (reprint author), UNIV LEEDS,DEPT MECH ENGN,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,NETHERLANDS SOC MATERIALS SCIENCE,ZWIJNDRECHT,"PO BOX 390, N-3330 ZWIJNDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,90-803513-3-4,,,,1997.0,,,,,,,543,545,,,,,,3,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Materials Science,BJ43N,WOS:A1997BJ43N00125,,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro experiments have proved that MA 956 with and without scale exhibits an excellent corrosion behaviour being the corrosion intensities lower than those of metallic biomaterials in use. It is worth to remark that scale decreases the corrosion intensity at least up to two orders of magnitude with respect to the uncoated material, which corrosion behaviour is also excellent. The elevated compressive residual stresses in the scale guarantee its integrity during tensile deformation and account for the good fatigue and wear behaviour.

We evaluated the biocompatibility of a gamma ray crosslinked poly(ethylene oxide) gel in two critical situations. Materials and methods In 3 rabbits, a 5 mm inner diameter annular channel of 1 mm width was delaminated at 80 % corneal depth and a sterile gamma ray crosslinked polyethylene oxide gel was injected in the channel. In cornea 1 (control), the annulus was centered on. the corneal apex and the channel was fully filled with gel. In cor-nea 2, the delamination was purposely decentered and the channel was approximately 1 mm from the limbus at ifs closest point. In corrnea 3, the centered channel was purposely partially filled. After a 6 month follow-up, the rabbits were sacrificed for histology. Results Histopathology showed the oval channel walls to be irregular and a slight thinning of the epithelium located above the implant but no abnormalities in the stromal thickness. No mononuclear, po nuclear cells or other signs of encapsulation or rejection were found around the polymer in any the animals. In cor-nea 3, fibroblasts were found on the lateral sides of the hydrogel globules. No limbal neovascularization tvas observed over the 6 month period in any of the animals. Conclusions The injected PEO gel followed intimately the delaminated stromal channel and was well tolerated in the cornea. The fibroblastic reaction found in partially filled channels is caused by the normal wound healing process and not by the hydrogel chemical properties.",,"Legeais, JM (reprint author), UNIV PARIS 06,HOTEL DIEU,INSERM U86,SERV OPHTHALMOL,1 PL PARVIS NOTRE DAME,F-75004 PARIS,FRANCE.",,,,,,,30,2,2,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0181-5512,,,J FR OPHTALMOL,J.

Formation of dense and tightly-bonded surface layers may prevent plasma protein adsorption owing to steric repulsion. General conditions for formation of layers, protecting blood components from direct contacts with the surface, are discussed. It seems to be necessary to ensure a delicate balance between adsorption energy of the attached chains and their length. The crucial point is to get a high grafting density which is more influential than high chain length. Length should be calibrated to the size of protein molecules to meet both effective repulsion and high density of the protecting chains and to avoid chain displacement by plasma proteins.","Fachhsch Osnabruck, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia","Kummerlowe, C (reprint author), Fachhsch Osnabruck, Albrechtstr 30, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany.",,,,,,,30,0,0,0,3,GORDON BREACH SCI PUBL LTD,READING,"C/O STBS LTD, PO BOX 90, READING RG1 8JL, BERKS, ENGLAND",0021-8464,,,J ADHESION,J.

The synthesized IABb copolymers contained higher boron and amine moieties than the LAB copolymer. The results of the dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that IABb copolymer-coated surfaces showed a relatively hydrophobic nature, changing to hydrophilic in response to the aqueous environment. BAECs cultured on the copolymer substrata developed into capillary networks after 7 days. This is probably due to the enrichment of boron and amine segments in the vicinity of the hydrophilic copolymer surface, enhancing more pronounced interaction of boronates with cell membrane glycocalyx. The introduction of n-butyl methacrylate into the polymers might enhance the diffusion of the hydrophobic segments to the bulk polymers and the concentration of relatively hydrophilic segments at the outermost polymer surfaces by contact with water. A copolymer (IAP) without boronic acid groups was also prepared using N-phenylacrylamide (P) as a comonomer instead of 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid in the IAB copolymer to investigate the effect of boronic acid moieties on the capillary formation of the cultured cells. Although the endothelial cells seeded on the copolymer without boronic acid groups adhered during the early culture period, these cells showed neither proliferation nor differentiation and detached from the surface after 13 days. These results strongly support the opinion that the phenylboronic acid groups in the copolymers are responsible for the specific induction of tissue formation of BAECs through the interaction with glycoconjugates on the cell membranes.","Sophia Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 102, Japan; Tokyo Womens Med Coll, Inst Biomed Engn, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 162, Japan; Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Mat Sci, Noda, Chiba 278, Japan; Sci Univ Tokyo, Biosci Res Inst, Noda, Chiba 278, Japan","Okano, T (reprint author), Sophia Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 102, Japan.",,"Okano, Teruo/J-4028-2012; Kataoka, Kazunori/K-7108-2012","Kataoka, Kazunori/0000-0002-8591-413X",,,,24,4,4,0,16,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The IPN-structured hydrogels were synthesized by sequential cross-linking reaction of N-methacryloyl-glycylglycylglycyl-terminated PEG and Dex. In vitro degradation of the IPN-structured hydrogels was examined using papain and dextranase as model enzymes of hydrolyzing oligopeptide and Dex, respectively. Specific degradation in the presence of papain and dextranase was observed in the IPN-structured hydrogel with a particular composition of oligopeptide-PEG and Dex. This same hydrogel was not degraded by one of the two enzymes. The IPN-structured hydrogels were characterized by water content, thermal mechanical analysis, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and the results were compared with those of co-cross-linked hydrogels consisting of N-methacryloyl-glycylglycylglycyl-terminated PEG and methacryloyl Dex. The results suggest that the IPN-structured hydrogels contain physical chain entanglements between networks as well as chemical cross-linked networks. It is concluded that the double-stimuli-responsive degradation observed in the IPN-structured hydrogel is achieved by controlling the chain entanglements between the two biodegradable polymers. Such degradation property of the IPN-structured hydrogel can be useful as a fail-safe system for guaranteed drug delivery and/or medical micromachines.","JAPAN ADV INST SCI & TECHNOL,SCH MAT SCI,TATSUNOKUCHI,ISHIKAWA 92312,JAPAN",,,"KURISAWA, MOTOICHI/C-1325-2014","KURISAWA, MOTOICHI/0000-0003-2413-6933",,,,26,28,28,4,17,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecylsilane (ODS) surfaces have been applied as models for different biocompatible materials. By immunofluorescence we could demonstrate that FN receptors organize on the: dorsal cell surface of adhering fibroblasts in a specific linear pattern along with actin filaments, but only if the cells were attached to hydrophilic glass. In contrast, FN receptors were not reorganized on hydrophobic octadecylsilane (ODS). In parallel experiments, FN matrix formation after 72 h of incubation on the same substrata has been analyzed microscopically, and quantified by cell ELISA, in order to be further correlated with the integrin receptor functioning in contact with the biomaterials. II was found that FN structuring and the amount of FN matrix have been significantly diminished on ODS that was related to the observed changes in integrin receptor functioning. To learn more about the mechanism of this phenomenon, desorption of I-125-FN from these substrata was studied and found to be significantly decreased on hydrophobic ODS. As a consequence, FN receptor (function) might be arrested on the ventral cell surface, thus the important role of beta 1 integrins in the positional organization of the FN matrix may be disturbed. In light of these facts, antibody-induced clustering of FN receptor can be considered as a useful model for studying the early steps of FN matrix formation on biomaterials.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH, INST CHEM, ABT MEMBRANFORSCH, D-14513 TELTOW, GERMANY","Altankov, G (reprint author), BULGARIAN ACAD SCI, INST BIOPHYS, STR ACAD G BONCHEV, BL 21, BU-1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,42,46,46,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Membranes based on pure polyacrylonitrile, or its copolymers differing in their content of acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and allylsulphonate were investigated with respect to kallikrein-like activity, and physicochemical surface properties. It was found that high content in 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and acrylic acid caused a substantial activation of the contact system while low content in allylsulphonate (less than 2 mol%) did not result in enhanced kallikrein-like activity. The activating materials were characterized to be highly wettable, and had the most negative zeta potentials.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN, SCH MED CHARITE, SCH DENT, DEPT PROSTHET, D-10098 BERLIN, GERMANY","Groth, T (reprint author), GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH, INST CHEM, DEPT MEMBRANE RES, KANTSTR 55, D-14513 TELTOW, GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,40,18,19,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

HeLa S3 cells were cultured on these substrates for 24 h. The expressed HSP 70s mRNA was then isolated and detected using the RT-PCR method. As a result, the expression of HSP 70B mRNA was largely induced in cells that adhered to hydrophilic surfaces. On the other hand, on hydrophobic surfaces, the HSP 70B mRNA expression was low. It is concluded that HSP 70B mRNA expression is sensitive to differences in the hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity of the substrates.","KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN",,,,,,,,21,17,17,0,1,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Data concerning its possible influence on bacterial attachment and resistance to biomaterial-associated infection are, so far, lacking. In the present work, the in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, one isolate of each species, to plain poly(vinyl chloride) (plain PVC) and heparin coated poly(vinyl chloride) (EPA-PVC) segments was compared. Also, the influence of precoating the segments with human normal plasma for 2 h was studied. S-35-Methionine was used to radiolabel bacteria. The segments were exposed to bacterial suspensions of approximately 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter at 37 degrees C for 0.5-6 h. Following repeated washing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), radioactivity associated with the segments was measured. Plain PVC as compared to EPA-PVC bound significantly more cells of all three tested species. Plasma precoating significantly decreased adherence of the tested species to plain PVC but did not affect the binding to EPA-PVC. However, after precoating with human plasma, EPA-PVC compared to plain PVC showed a higher binding of S. aureus which might possibly be due to bridging effects of fibronectin or other plasma proteins, interacting with S. aureus.","LUND UNIV, DEPT THORAC SURG, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN; LUND UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN; LUND UNIV, DEPT MED MICROBIOL, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN","Zdanowski, Z (reprint author), LUND UNIV, DEPT SURG, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,35,14,15,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Specifically, measurements of fibrinogen adsorption, platelet adhesion, kallikrein generation, and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) release were performed. The catheter materials examined in this study included: platinum-cured, 50 shore A durometer, barium sulfate-filled, silicone (SI); Tecoflex EG85A-B20 polyurethane (PU); PU catheters whose outer surface had been impregnated with ion beam-deposited silver atoms (AgI and AgII); PU catheters coated with a hydrophilic, polyacrylic acid polymer (UC); PU catheters coated with an air-cured PTFE emulsion (CS); and PU catheters coated with an aminofunctional dimethylsiloxane copolymer (JG). The time course of fibrinogen adsorption from plasma to the SI, JG, PU, and CS materials was similar, with CS exhibiting the least amount of adsorbed fibrinogen after 1 h (65 +/- 4.7 ng cm(-2)) and PU the greatest (144 +/- 16.5 ng cm(-2)). After 90 min of contact, AgI and AgII exhibited the greatest number of adherent platelets, levels that were approximately two to three times higher than those on the other catheter materials. With the exception of UC and PU, which caused kallikrein generation levels approximately half that of the positive (glass) control, little kallikrein formation was observed for any of the materials relative to the negative control. Finally, FPA generation was greatest using the SI: CS, and PU materials, with the latter causing the production of almost four times the amount of FPA as the negative control. This preliminary assessment of the hemocompatibility of the various catheters suggests that the surface treatments did not adversely affect their interactions with blood components; further investigations of these materials are therefore warranted in order to completely characterize their behavior prior to use in clinical situations.","UNIV MEMPHIS,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,MEMPHIS,TN 38152; SIMS DELTEC INC,DEPT RES & DEV,ACCESS SYST DIV,ST PAUL,MN 55112",,,,,,,,19,7,7,1,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The intermediate was then subjected to a transesterification to form the PPF-based polymer. This method allowed for production of a polymer with a number average molecular weight up to 1500 and a polydispersity index of 2.8 and below. The polymeric backbone structure was investigated through the use of FTIR and NMR. Kinetic studies of the transesterification allowed mapping of the molecular weight increase with reaction time.

As a model system, release of recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) from this polymer was evaluated. The polyphosphate was synthesized using a triethylamine catalyst in an argon environment, and characterized using elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Degradation kinetics of the polyphosphate polymer in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were represented by a second-order polynomial while degradation in bovine serum was linear with time. The polymer degraded faster in PBS than in bovine serum. In vitro release of OP-1 was also faster in PBS than in serum. Release kinetics of OP-1 in PBS and serum were represented by second-order polynomials. The OP-1 release from this physically dispersed polymeric matrix may be described by several possible mechanisms: diffusion, bulk polymer degradation, ion complexation, and interactions among the protein (OP-1), polymer, proteins, and enzymes in the media. This polyphosphate may be an effective carrier for morphogens, growth factors, or other classes of bioactive molecules.

We have previously shown that monocytes and macrophages responding to particles of bone cement are capable of differentiating into osteoclastic cells which resorb bone. To determine whether the radio-opaque additives barium sulphate (BaSO4) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) influence this process, particles of PMMA with and without these agents were added to mouse monocytes and cocultured with osteoblast-like cells on bone slices, Osteoclast differentiation, as shown by the presence of the osteoclast-associated enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and lacunar bone resorption,,vas observed in all cocultures. The addition of PMMA alone to these cocultures caused no increase in TRAP expression or bone resorption relative to control cocultures, Adding PMMA particles containing BaSO4 or ZrO2, however, caused an increase in TRAP expression and a highly significant increase in bone resorption, Particles containing BaSO4 mere associated with 50% more bone resorption than those containing ZrO2. Our results suggest that radio-opaque agents in bone cement may contribute to the bone resorption of aseptic loosening by enhancing macrophage-osteoclast differentiation, and that PMMA containing BaSO4 is likely to be associated with more osteolysis than that containing ZrO2.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR, NHS TRUST, OXFORD OX3 7LD, ENGLAND",,,"Murray, David/D-7117-2011",,Wellcome Trust,,,37,105,107,0,8,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",0301-620X,2044-5377,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

Antibodies directed against platelet membrane antigen and P-selectin were used to visualize platelet adhesion and activation. Acridine orange and anti-CD11b were used to detect adhesion and activation of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs). Antibodies against thrombospondin were used as markers for platelet alpha-granules. The fluorescence intensity was quantitated by computer-aided image analysis. Commercially pure, polished sheet titanium was oxidized in two different ways: (1) the natural oxide was dissolved with hydrofluoric acid and a new oxide layer was grown by oxidation in nitric acid, or (2) annealing was performed at 700 degrees C in air. Auger electron spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that both surfaces had similar composition consisting of TiO2 covered by a carbonaceous surface contamination layer. The thickness of the oxide layer was 4 nm on the acid-oxidized surface and 39 nm on the annealed surface. Optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy showed that the acid-oxidized surface was rough and the annealed surface was smooth. The fibrinogen/prothrombin-thrombin ratio in the initial protein film differed between the surfaces. The number of adhering platelets was larger at the surface with a high surface concentration of adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet activation (CD62) and priming of PMNs (CD 11b) were also significantly higher on the acid-oxidized surface. The results indicate that non-self recognition of biomaterials is an array of transient reactions comprising protein-material, protein-cell, and cell-cell interactions.","CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT APPL PHYS, S-41296 GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN","Nygren, H (reprint author), UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, MED AREGATAN 5, S-41390 GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,44,69,70,0,9,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

The greatly reduced PCC of the hydrophilic variant might also suggest that hydrophilic variants of silicone would be more biocompatible than those currently used, The PCC of PEP for the IgGs was less than that of Imm 2 but still optimal at physiological conditions, Consistent with the data on Lf/Trf, PCC progressively decreased with increasing ionic strength at alkaline pH, Differences in pl between the protein pairs had only a marginal effect on the PCC of PEP, Monolayer adsorption on both PEP and Imm 2 was slowly reversible and greater in the presence of free ligand (<2% in 16 h) suggesting that the process follows Mass Law principles, However, even in the presence of non-ionic detergent and free ligand, 85-90% remained bound on either surface, Thus, desorption of proteins in the monolayer should not complicate subsequent immunochemical studies conducted on adsorbed monolayers.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity for titanium implant biomaterials could affect crevicular LPS concentrations and thereby influence periimplant inflammation. Purpose of study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli LPS affinity for titanium biomaterials groups that differed in surface oxide composition and surface roughness. Material and method. Polished and abraded grade 1 commercially pure titanium and grade 5 alloyed extra low interstitial titanium specimens were treated with 10 EU/mm(2) and radiolabeled LPS. Results. The resultant mean +/- SD LPS adherence values ranged from 4.17 +/- 0.29 to 4.79 +/- 0.40 EU/mm(2). No difference in adherence and elution was indicated on the basis of LPS type, surface oxide composition, or surface roughness. Moreover, P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS desorption was below detection. Conclusion. Clinically, the high affinity of both LPS types for titanium biomaterials may adversely influence the periimplant tissue response.","MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL & ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912","Nelson, SK (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,34,36,36,1,3,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-3913,,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

Experiments involved laser welding of elastin heterographs to the intimal surface of the carotid artery (in vitro, porcine) as a similar to 4x5 mm(2) spot weld, then determining the breaking strength when the two tissues were pulled in a direction parallel to the plane of the spot weld while submerged in water. The questions answered are: WHAT IS THE PEAK TEMPERATURE REQUIRED FOR WELDING ELASTIN HETEROGRAPH TO THE INTIMAL SURFACE OF CAROTID ARTERY? ANSWER: similar to 300 degrees C threshold, similar to 600 degrees C for maximum strength. This estimate is based on optical measurements of dye accumulation in stain laver and measurements of thickness of stain layer via fluorescence microscope examination. WHAT IS THE DEPENDENCE OF WELD STRENGTH ON THE LASER EXPOSURE? ANSWER: Breaking force (g) = Max*(1-exp(-(E-p-E-th)/U-67)), where Max is the maximum strength achievable by laser welding, expressed as the breaking force in g when elastin heterograph and tissue are pulled. E-p is the laser pulse energy. E-th is the apparent threshold laser pulse energy that will break the weld. U-67 is the laser energy above threshold which achieves 67% of Max. Max was about 15 g for the similar to 20 mm(2) weld area of our experiments. E-th was 0.8 J. U-67 was 1.44 J. DOES WELD STRENGTH DEPEND ON HYDRATION CONDITIONS? ANSWER: Not on the amount of excess unbound water. There was no significant difference in weld strength between welding dripping wet tissues vs well blotted tissues. WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN IRRADIATING THE WELD SURFACE THROUGH THE BIOMATERIAL VS THROUGH THE TISSUE, WHEN THE BIOMATERIAL IS PARTIALLY STAINED WITH ICG? ANSWER: There is a difference if the stain layer is heavily stained. Irradiation through the tissue allows direct irradiation on the weld surface which achieves the highest peak temperatures for the least laser pulse energy. irradiation through the elastin heterograph causes direct irradiation of the rear surface of the stain layer, within the biomaterial and away from the weld surface, and thermal diffusion must bring the heat to the weld surface. This difference occurs only when the absorption by the stain layer is sufficiently high that little laser energy directly reaches the weld surface.",,"Jacques, SL (reprint author), OREGON MED LASER CTR,PORTLAND,OR 97225, USA.",,,,,,,0,7,7,0,1,SPIE - INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010",,,0-8194-2386-6,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1997.0,2975,,,,,,54,61,,10.1117/12.275511,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Optics",Engineering; Optics,BJ12Q,WOS:A1997BJ12Q00006,,,,,2019-02-25

The blade profiles were chosen to show the effect of sharpness and to admit finite element simulation. The key computed quantity to be compared with experiments is the reaction force on the knife.

The applications of mu CT with respect to the analysis of bone are manyfold. Nevertheless, it also holds high promise for the microstructural measurement and analysis of porous biomaterials. For the purpose of the study, a desk-top mu CT providing a nominal isotropic resolution of 14 mu m was used. Since the polymeric material has a very low X-ray absorption coefficient, the scaffolds were stained prior to measurement using a commercial X-ray contrast agent. This allowed not only to acquire important microstructural features of the three-dimensional scaffold but also to compute standard structural indices such as BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp and the degree of anisotropy (DA) using mean intercept length measurements. The preliminary results show that different types of scaffolds can be distinguished both qualitatively (visualization) and quantitatively (morphometry) provided an adequate X-ray staining technique is used.

The results of these studies have shown that the wear factor is proportional to the counterface roughness raised to a power greater than one. In this laboratory study, the effect of surface finish of several biomaterials on the wear of UHMWPE was studied. The study was conducted using reciprocating pin-on-plate wear tests with bovine serum as a lubricant. The biomaterials investigated as the counterface material included stainless steel, cast cobalt chrome (CoCr), CoCr (ASTM F799), alumina ceramic and zirconia ceramic. The counterface topographies of the wear plates were produced using techniques representative of current manufacturing methods. The surface roughness of the wear plates was varied in the range R-a = 0.005-0.04 mu m; this was representative of femoral heads and femoral knee components currently used clinically. Metals and ceramics with a similar surface roughness produced a similar wear rate of UHMWPE. For the limited range of smooth counterfaces used in this study only a moderate correlation was found between the surface roughness and the wear factors. For a change in counterface roughness R-a of 0.005 to 0.04 mu m, the wear factor increased from 7.4 +/- 1.6 to 16.5 +/- 2.4 x 10(-9) mm(3)/N m (mean +/- standard error). This variation in counterface roughness had much less effect in wear than previously reported for rougher counterfaces. For an extended range of counterface roughness, a stronger correlation was found using an exponential function for the regression fit. The exponential function shows the benefits of decreased wear with decreased surface roughness. Although the wear rate decreased less rapidly with decreased counterface roughness for R-a values below 0.05 mu m, there were significant advantages to be gained from improved femoral head roughness to below 0.01 mu m R-a.",,"Lancaster, JG (reprint author), UNIV LEEDS,DEPT MECH ENGN,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,32,89,91,4,18,MECHANICAL ENG PUBL LTD,EDMUNDS,"PO BOX 24, NORTHGATE AVE, BURY ST, EDMUNDS, SUFFOLK, ENGLAND IP32 6BW",0954-4119,,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

The GAGs have been characterized in terms of total sulfate content and relative molecular weight. The amount of immobilized GAGs was 10(3) times higher than the theoretical amount for monomolecular side-to-side coordination on polymer surfaces. In a standardized perfusion system with shear rates of 1050 sec(-1), 37 degrees C, and 5 minutes with citrated blood, the level of platelet adhesion was 100% for partially cationized membrane, 90% for HA, 75% for each HE, CS, DS, KS, 5% for unmodified cellulose membrane, and 5% for confluent bovine aorta endothelial cells, referred to subendothelial matrix as standard for 100% platelet adhesion. ESHS-coated membranes were completely inert to platelets. The amount of ionically released GAGs during perfusion was also estimated. The partial cationic membrane is a suitable polymer surface in combination with the perfusion system to estimate the hemocompatibility of ionically immobilized water-soluble polyanions in terms of platelet adhesion at defined shear rates. The results of platelet adhesion are discussed in terms of structure and analytical parameter of the immobilized GAGs.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Klin Chem & Pathobiochem, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Kliniken Stadt Koln, Cologne, Germany","Baumann, H (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Klin Chem & Pathobiochem, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,64,14,14,0,3,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"333 SEVENTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10001 USA",0094-6176,1098-9064,,SEMIN THROMB HEMOST,Semin.

The coating is graded in accordance to adhesive strength and bioresorbability. The bond coat On the metal stub is deposited with a particle range of the hydroxyapatite materials that will provide a high adhesive strength and bioactivity but have poor bioresorption properties. The top coat however is composed of mainly alpha-tricalcium phosphate that is highly bioresorbable. This arrangement has the propensity of allowing accelerated bio-integration of the coating by the body tissues as the top layer is rapidly resorbed, leaving the more bioactive intermediate layer to facilitate the much needed bioactive properties for proper osteoconduction.

Patients: 40 patients had a polyurethane double-J ureteric stent inserted between June 1994 and March 1995, Group 1 comprised 22 stone farmers whose stents were placed in support of endourological treatment or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of renal or ureteric calculi. Group 2 comprised 18 patients whose stents were inserted for advanced and obstructive malignancy (n=8) of as an adjunct to reconstructive surgery or endourological techniques (n=10). After removal, stents were examined for encrustation and obstruction. A biochemical semiquantitative analysis was performed for deposits greater than or equal to 5 mg, and smaller sediments were examined with a polarizing optical microscope. Results: The incidence of encrustation was significantly higher (p=0.009) for stone formers. In addition, in this group indwelling times of encrusted and obstructed stents were significantly shorter (p=0.03 and 0.02, respectively), No particular relationship was found between the incidence of encrustation and indwelling times for stone formers. Conversely, for patients without urolithiasis, indwelling times were significantly longer for encrusted or obstructed stents than for unaffected ones (p=0.05 and 0.02, respectively), Biochemical and optical analyses of encrustations mainly revealed calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and ammonium magnesium phosphate. Calcium oxalate was the main crystalline phase, especially in the absence of urinary infection. Conclusion: Calcium oxalate represents the principal component of double-J ureteric stent encrustations. Thus, prophylaxis of encrustation may consist of preventive measures usually applied in cases of recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis.",,"Robert, M (reprint author), UNIV MONTPELLIER, HOP LAPEYRONIE, DEPT UROL, 371 AV DOYEN GASTON GIRAUD, F-34295 MONTPELLIER 5, FRANCE.",,,,,,,20,41,45,0,5,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0042-1138,1423-0399,,UROL INT,Urol.Int.,,1997.0,58,2,,,,,100,104,,10.1159/000282959,,,,5,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,WN831,WOS:A1997WN83100007,9096271.0,,,,2019-02-25

Surgical repair using different prosthetic biomaterials gains more and more acceptance. Therefore we wanted to evaluate our own results of hernia repair and anlayze the results of a mesh hernioplasty using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch (ePTFE). Patients and methods: 1. During the study period (1984-1992) a total of 205 hernia repairs (148 primary repairs, 57 repairs for recurrent hernia) were done in 173 patients at our institution using the following techniques: Mayo technique n = 90, simple one layer suture n = 56, absorbable mesh n = 25, ePTFE n = 17, other mesh techniques n = 17. In a retrospective study 135 of these patients (78 %) could be examined clinically The average follow up time was 44 months (10-105). 2. Since 1988 we used the ePTFE patch (Gore-tex Soft Tissue Patch) in selected cases for incisional hernia repair. In a second retrospective analysis the course of 26 patients, who were operated between 1988 and 1994, is reported. Results: 1. Local wound complications occurred in 3-6 % with conventional techniques and in 11-13 % after different types of mesh repair (n.s.). Overall recurrence rates were 30 % for primary hernia repair and 38 % for recurrent hernia repair without statistically different rates for the various techniques. The presence of two or more patient dependent risk factors (obesity, obstructive lung disease etc.) (p < 0.05) and hernia diameter > 5 cm (p < 0.05) were identified as risk factors for hernia recurrency. 2. In the ePTFE group one patient (4 %) developed a superficial wound complication, in another three patients (12 %) the patch had to be removed due to deep wound infections. All three patients had revealed septic wound complications after previous surgery. The recurrence rates (17 % for primary repair and 20 % for repeated repair) were clearly lower compared to conventional techniques. Conclusions: The use of prosthetic mesh should be considered for repair of large or recurrent incisional hernias, especially in high risk patients (obesity, obstructive lung disease). Beside the most often used polypropylene mesh, the ePTFE patch (Gore-tex-Soft-Tissue-Patch) represents a valuable alternative in selected cases with direct contact of the prosthesis to abdominal viscera, Any previous septic wound complication or a contaminated operating field (e.g. colostomy) seems to be a contraindication for its use.",,"Trupka, AW (reprint author), UNIV MUNICH,KLINIKUM INNENSTADT,CHIRURG KLIN & POLIKLIN,NUSSBAUMSTR 20,D-80336 MUNICH,GERMANY.",,,,,,,19,20,21,0,1,JOHANN AMBROSIUS BARTH VERLAG,HEIDELBERG,"IM WEIHER 10, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0044-409X,,,ZBL CHIR,Zent.bl.

The peptides and the fusion proteins have been partitioned in aqueous two-phase systems of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-dextran and Ucon-dextran. The studied model protein was ZZT0, where Z is an engineered domain of domain B of staphylococcal protein A. The specially designed hydrophobic peptides, Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro (T1) and (Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro), (T2), have been inserted into ZZT0, to give the peptide-protein fusions ZZT1 and ZZT2. In the experimental studies it was found that T1 and T2 preferred the PEG phase and even more the Ucon phase over the dextran phase. For T2 the partitioning was more one sided than for T1. For the fusion proteins, ZZT1 and ZZT2, the partitioning was enhanced into the PEG or Ucon rich phase as compared to ZZT0. The effects were lower than expected from independent contributions to the partition coefficient from the protein and the peptides. A heterogeneous lattice model was used to calculate theoretical peptide and protein partition coefficients. The calculations could reproduce the qualitative features of the experimental data. The model results suggest that a part of these experimentally observed effects is due to a depletion zone, i.e. a zone of reduced polymer concentration around the protein. The experimental results indicate a further reduction of the partition coefficient, beyond that predicted by the lattice calculations. A possible folding of the inserted peptide is discussed as a plausible mechanism for this further reduction in the partition coefficient.","LUND UNIV,DEPT BIOCHEM,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN; ROYAL INST TECHNOL,DEPT BIOCHEM & BIOTECHNOL,S-10044 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,34,24,24,4,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0021-9673,,,J CHROMATOGR A,J.

Contact of the patients' blood with the nonendothelial surface of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is responsible for several, potentially harmful systemic reactions. Methods. The patients' response to extracorporeal circulation is reviewed briefly. The interactions between patient and circuit are discussed not only as they relate to blood-material contact, but also from a mechanical and theologic standpoint The theoretic benefits of the newer, more hemocompatible materials are presented, along with a review of published clinical experience with heparinized cardiopulmonary bypass circuits. Results. The response to extracorporeal circulation extends far beyond a simple derangement of hemostasis. This inflammatory response is strongly influenced by the theologic design of the circuit and by the physical and chemical properties of the surface. Heparinized circuits decrease inflammation, but the clinical benefits of this reduction remain unclear, except for extended cardiopulmonary support. The safe use of these circuits requires full heparinization and does not reduce allogeneic transfusions. Conclusions. Clinicians are still in the search of the ideal material and the ideal extracorporeal circuit design. Newer, heparinized materials offer real but limited clinical benefits.","CHU BORDEAUX, INSERM U306, BIOMAT RES UNIT, BORDEAUX, FRANCE; CHU BORDEAUX, DEPT ANESTHESIA, BORDEAUX, FRANCE; UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT ANESTHESIA, MONTREAL HEART INST, MONTREAL, PQ, CANADA",,,,,,,,56,36,38,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0003-4975,1552-6259,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

The protein adsorption was studied by ellipsometry-antibody techniques in situ, and adhering platelets were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-CD 61 antibodies. Adhering platelets were quantified by counting labelled cells in microscopic image fields. The spreading of platelets was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that after 1 min of plasma exposure, fibrinogen, IgG and albumin were detectable with antibodies on both surfaces. The amount of deposited fibrinogen and complement decreased with time on titanium, and the amount of adsorbed anti-high molecular weight kininogen increased. No complement was detected on gold surfaces after plasma incubation, and the antibody binding pattern also remained unchanged after prolonged plasma exposure. The surface-bound platelets were found to spread on the gold but not on titanium surfaces. C1q has been shown to induce the expression of P-selectin, i.e. cause secretion reactions in platelets. In this study secreted platelet-microvesicles were found on gold, but not on the titanium surfaces that bound significant amounts of C1q. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that the mixture of fibrinogen, C1q and kininogens, whilst causing adhesion and aggregation, does not result in the activation and microvesicle secretion of platelets. Platelet activation on biomaterial surfaces thus seems to be governed by the mixture of proteins present on that surface, and no one particular protein need cause a known reaction in platelets as obtained when platelets are exposed only to that particular protein.

Ultrastructurally, the test material was circumscribed with an electron-dense structure, and was immediately adjacent to elongated cyoplasmic processes with intact morphology or collagen fibrils with periodic structures. Furthermore, the mineralization of the extracellular collagenous matrix occurred directly on the surface of the material.

Fresh and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries were used as controls. Both the epoxy-fixed and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries showed significant increases in fixation index and denaturation temperature as compared to the fresh one. Additionally, the resistance of porcine arteries against bacterial collagenase in vitro degradation increased significantly after cross-linking with the epoxy compound or glutaraldehyde. The reduction of the tensile strength of the epoxy-fixed artery after bacterial collagenase degradation was more severe than in its glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart. Generally, with increasing pH, temperature or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed porcine arteries increased. The results obtained in this study may be used to optimize the fixation process for developing a small-diameter biological vascular graft fixed by an epoxy compound.

We studied the behaviour of a new type of polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis used for the repair of abdominal wall defects, Dual Mesh(R) (DM), which has two different faces; one face has a porosity between 30 and 60 mu m, while the other is nonporous. In 20 New Zealand White rabbits, a full-thickness (except skin) 7 cm x 5 cm defect was created in the anterior abdominal wall that was repaired with DM. At 14, 30, 60 and 90 days, samples were obtained and studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. An immunohistochemical study was made with antibody anti-rabbit macrophages (RAM-11). Tensile strength was measured with an Instron tensiometer using 2-cm-wide strips obtained parallel to the shorter axis of the implant. DM induced little tissue adhesion to the material on the visceral peritoneum interface and was surrounded by organized repair tissue. The biomaterial was integrated in the repair tissue on the subcutaneous interface, but not on the peritoneal interface. The macrophage response decreased between days 14 and 90 (P < 0.001). Tensile strength increased significantly (P < 0.05) at every study period. We conclude that the DM prosthesis has little tendency to formation of visceral adhesions, the DM prosthesis was well tolerated by the receptor organism and the tensile strength of the prosthesis/receptor tissue interface increased with time.

The second part is focused on the synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural biopolymers used for these applications. The natural and semi-synthetic polymers discussed include cellulose-derivatives, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, chitosan, collagen and gelatin, among others. Poly(vinyl alcohol), different polyesters, poly(alkylcyano acrylate), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho esters) and alkyl half-esters of poly(vinyl ether/maleic anhydride) represent the most widely investigated biodegradable synthetic polymers for ocular applications.

Protein expression for collagen types I, III, and V, and for anti-human macrophages CD68 (DAKO-CD68, KP1) and CD68 (PG-M1), and anti-human myeloid/histiocyte antigen (DAKO-MAC 387) were determined immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibodies. At 24 and 48 h, levels of mRNA for alkaline phosphatase and osteonectin were greater than mRNA levels for osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen type I alpha 1, and collagen type I alpha 2 for cells grown on the three substrata. However, at 48 h mRNA levels for alkaline phosphatase and osteonectin were significantly higher on the modified ceramic substrata relative to the native alumina. HBD cells appear to express CD68-KP1 when cultured for 24 h. The techniques provide a sensitive and reproducible assay to evaluate gene and protein expression of cells grown on different substrata.

Experiments performed during both cooling and heating and with samples of different thermal histories show a broad endothermic feature beginning at ca. 160 K which is barely interrupted by a partial-crystallization exotherm at ca. 250 K. The endothermic features resembled those observed for several simpler hydrated proteins (Biophys. J., 1994, 66, 249; J. Phys. Chem., 1994, 98, 13780), a hydrated crosslinked polymer (J. Phys. Chem., 1990, 94 2689) and a dry interpenetrating network polymer blend (J. Polym. Sci. B, 1992, 32, 683). Their broadness is a result of the closely spaced multiplicity of small but sharp mini-endotherms and has its origin in the onset of different configurational substrates that become available to the protein's structure as the temperature is increased. The remarkable similarity of these features amongst a broad class of materials is a reflection of the predominant role of the intermolecular energy barriers in determining the structural relaxation kinetics. This has been described in terms of a time-dependent potential-energy surface, which represent a hierarchy of molecular and segmental motions. Ice and freeze-concentrated solution coexist at a thermodynamic equilibrium at T < 273 K. Their respective amounts have been measured between 260 and 273 K and formalism based on equilibrium thermodynamics has been developed, and the DSC scans for cooling simulated. This formalism agrees with the data. The temperature variation of the equilibrium constant for the protein-water <-> protein-ice coexistence does not agree with that given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which is a reflection of strong interactions between the water molecules and H-bonding protein segments. The interpretation in terms of the role of protein dynamics in the crystallization of water, and the formalism developed, are general and useful for studies on other complex biomaterials.",,"Johari, GP (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,HAMILTON,ON L8S 4L7,CANADA.",,,,,,,62,33,33,0,1,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK MILTON ROAD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4WF",0956-5000,,,J CHEM SOC FARADAY T,J.

Dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid, which is negatively charged at physiological conditions, was more easily transferred onto the solid substrate in the presence of divalent cations as compared to the zwitterionic phospholipids dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine and its ether analog dihexadecyl-phosphatidylcholine. The structure across the film was characterized by X-ray reflectivity and X-ray diffraction, whereas the in-plane structure was investigated by electron diffraction. X-ray experiments revealed a repeat unit of 5.35 nm for the LB him of phosphatidic acid. A model for the Y-type structure of this film is presented based on a modeling technique of the X-ray reflectivity data. The substructure of the film along the normal to the substrate plane is described in detail using this new approach. Electron diffraction indicated a hexagonal packing of the hydrocarbon chains normal to the substrate surface with a spacing of 0.425 nm. These parameters correlate well with data from bilayer structures. It can be supposed that LB films of acidic phospholipids are useful as membrane mimetic systems. Deposition of the zwitterionic phospholipids was of poor reproducibility, which could be improved in the presence of polymers. A spacing of about 7 nm was deduced for dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine films indicating that the polymer was transferred with the lipid onto the solid support.","RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,INST CRYSTALLOG,MOSCOW 117333,RUSSIA; ZELENOGRAD INST PHYS PROBLEMS,MOSCOW 103460,RUSSIA","Lohner, K (reprint author), AUSTRIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOPHYS & RONTGENSTRUKTURFORSCH,STEYRERGASSE 17-6,A-8010 GRAZ,AUSTRIA.",,"Konovalov, Oleg/C-6702-2019","Konovalov, Oleg/0000-0002-0390-5900",,,,38,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,NOV 15,1996.0,288,1-2,,,,,262,267,,10.1016/S0040-6090(96)08794-9,,,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,VZ205,WOS:A1996VZ20500050,,,,,2019-02-25

Two configurations to sense the binding of an antibody and a lectin to the complementary substrate monolayer are addressed. In one configuration, a fluorescein monolayer was assembled on an Au-electrode and binding of the complementary anti-fluorescein antibody Flc-Ab was followed by the examination of electrode insulation by the antibody towards a solubilized redox probe, Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-). The extent of electrode insulation is controlled by the Flc-Ab concentration in the sample and the electrode responds amperometrically to Flc-Ab concentrations as low as 0.7 mu M. The second configuration applies a redox-modified protein to analyze competitively the protein itself. An Au-electrode was modified by an alpha-D-mannopyranose monolayer, and a bipyridinium-modified concanavalin A was used to analyze concanavalin A (Con. A). Competitive binding of the redox-modified Con. A and the analyzed Con. A to the monolayer-modified electrode occurred, and the amperometric response was inversely proportional to the Con. A concentration. Quartz crystals coated with Au-electrodes were applied for the piezoelectric QCM analyses of Flc-Ab and Con. A. The crystal electrodes are modified with a fluorescein antigen monolayer. The Flc Ab was sensed by the changes in the crystal frequencies as a result of the antibody association to the electrode. Flc-Ab at a concentration as low as 5 ng ml(-1) was detected. The series of monosaccharides alpha-D-mannopyranose, beta-D-glucose or alpha-D-glucose was assembled onto the Au-electrodes of the quartz crystals and used as a sensing interface for concanavalin A.

However, essentially all previously examined topographies bear little relation to cell adhesion substrates found in biological tissues. In vivo, many cells are adherent to extracellular matrices (ECM), which have an extremely complex 3-D topography in the micrometre to nanometre range. In addition, many studies indicate that micro- and nano-scale mechanical stresses generated by cell-matrix adhesion have significant effects on cellular phenotypic behaviour. In this report we describe methodology for the fabrication of topographic replicas of the subendothelial ECM topography with a biomedical polyurethane. Using three-dimensional high resolution scanning electron microscopy, accurate replication of subendothelial ECM topography from the macroscopic to the macromolecular scale is demonstrated. Bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on the ECM replicas spread more rapidly and had a three-dimensional appearance and spread areas at confluence which appeared more like endothelial cells in native arteries, compared with cells cultured on untextured control surfaces. Since the fabrication process may be used with many different types of materials, including polymers of synthetic and biological origin, these biomimetic ECM-textured surfaces may find both research and clinical applications.

Amino acid analysis of the fresh porcine pericardium hybrid showed a reduction in lysine content after active isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomers exposure, indicating cross-linking between the polymer and tissue. Histological examination of the hybrid material shows a thin grey coating on both surfaces of the tissue, implying at least surface cross-linking oi the tissue with polyurethane.

In most instances, cells have sloughed off under flow conditions. The performance of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) designed to stabilize patients awaiting donor hearts for transplantation has been remarkably good. After prolonged implantation, pump surfaces become covered with a pannus of smooth muscle-like cells (myofibroblasts). Occasional islands of endothelial cells have been identified on top of such cell layers. Therefore, in an attempt to accelerate the beneficial conditioning and improve biomaterial-blood compatibility of LVAD internal surfaces, their seeding with autologous, genetically engineered smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was investigated. Methods and Results Since routine testing of the Thermo-cardiosystems HeartMate LVAD is carried out in calves, SMCs were isolated from calves, propagated in culture, and transduced with NO synthase genes to yield stable production of NO. Previous studies had demonstrated that SMCs attached strongly to the biomaterials that compose the internal surfaces of LVADs. Transduction of NO synthase gene expression in the SMCs was achieved by electroporation and antibiotic (G418) selection. Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by NO has been documented, and the same molecule has been shown to inhibit platelet adhesion to cell surfaces. Cells transduced with NO synthase expressed enzyme protein at consistently high levels for several passages in culture; however, NO production was dependent on the supplementation of culture medium with a source of tetrahydrobiopterin (sepiapterin). Under such conditions, transduced cells were growth-inhibited compared with mock-transfected controls. Induction of GTP cyclohydrolase (the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of tetrahydrobiopterin) expression also resulted in NO production by NO synthase-transduced cells. Conclusions Preliminary studies have shown that SMCs form strong attachments to the surface materials of LVADs and that their proliferation rates could be controlled after transformation with NO synthase under conditions that support production of NO. Therefore, genetically engineered SMCs may provide an improved blood-biomaterial interface for cardiovascular prostheses.",,"ScottBurden, T (reprint author), TEXAS MED CTR,TEXAS HEART INST,VASC CELL BIOL LAB,POB 20345,HOUSTON,TX 77225, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-53233],,,13,13,13,0,0,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,NOV 1,1996.0,94,9,,S,,,235,238,,,,,,4,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,VP690,WOS:A1996VP69000043,8901752.0,,,,2019-02-25

The authors evaluate whether dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DSA) is a reliable method to determine the density of natural coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) blocks used as bone graft substitutes. METHODS. To evaluate the basic density of HA blocks from the same coral heads with and without titanium meshes, densitometry of 12 HA-500 blocks (genus Goniopora) and 12 HA-200 blocks (genus Porites) was performed. In addition, density measurements of 30 HA blocks (HA-500, n = 15; HA-200, n = 15) from different coral heads were obtained to assess if the originating coral head influences the basic density of blocks within one coral genera. To assess standard deviation serial measurements on eight coralline HA blocks, four with titanium meshes and four without were performed. In the ex vivo study, densitometry of 12 HA blocks (HA-500, n = 4; HA-200, n = 8) used as bone graft substitutes in the mandibles and craniums of adult mongrel dogs was performed. Densities were measured after bone in growth for 2 and 4 months, respectively. All measurements were obtained with a Lunar DPX with scan mode ''slow 750'' in the spine program with the regions-of-interests selected manually. Bone ingrowth was assessed by computer-assisted histomorphometry, which was considered the gold standard. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate the densities of plain HA blocks with and without meshes to the specific weights of the blocks. RESULTS. Significant positive correlation was found between the density of each HA block (both coral species) with and without meshes and the calculated specific weights. Densitometry values showed no significant differences depending on the originating coral heads. Standard deviation ranged between +/-3.8% and +/-4.1% (HA-500) and between +/-3.0% and +/-3.8% (HA-200). Hydroxyapatite-500 blocks showed marked increased densities between 15% and 34% after 4 months in three specimens in which bone ingrowth between 16.9% and 21.1% was revealed by histomorphometry; no increase of density was observed in one specimen, which presented only minimal bone ingrowth and signs of infection. Despite bone invasion between 12% and 25.8%, no increased densities were observed for HA-200 implants. CONCLUSIONS. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is an accurate and reproducible modality to assess the densities of plain coralline HA blocks and to monitor bone ingrowth into coralline HA-500 but not into HA-200 block implants.","VET AFFAIRS MED CTR,DEPT RADIOL,SAN DIEGO,CA 92161; UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SAN DIEGO,CA 92103; UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT PLAST SURG,SAN DIEGO,CA 92103; INTERPORE INT INC,IRWINE,CA",,,,,,,,16,8,8,0,1,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0020-9996,,,INVEST RADIOL,Invest.

The present study has demonstrated that the Fluoropassiv(R) mesh provides adequate mechanical strength and compares favorably with the two controls. No exacerbated systemic or in situ hematologic or immunological reactions were observed with either the meshes or the patch material.

After 4 days, 1 month, and 3 months postimplantation, the tissue reactions and interactions were evaluated by light micros copy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Poly(tetrahydrofuran) (poly(THF)), poly(propylene oxide) (poly(POx)), and poly(tetrahydrofuran-co-oxetane) (poly (THF-co-OX)) were tested as relatively hydrophobic polyethers, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) and a poly(THF)/PEO blend were used as more hydrophilic materials. In general all polyethers showed good biocompatibility with respect to tissue reactions and interactions, with low neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, a quiet giant cell reaction, and formation of a thin fibrous capsule. For the relatively hydrophobic polyethers studied, the biostability increased in the order poly(POx) < poly(THF-co-OX) < poly(THF), probably indicating that the absence of tertiary hydrogen atoms has a positive effect on the biostability. Concerning the more hydrophilic materials, crosslinked PEO showed the highest rate of degradation, probably due to the mechanical weakness of the hydrogel in combination with the highest presence of giant cells as a result of the high porosity. A frayed surface morphology was observed after implantation of the crosslinked poly(THF)/PEO blend, which might be due to preferential degradation of PEO domains.

The HCLs used were 1) PMMA HCL, 2) oxygen-permeable HCL composed of a graft copolymer of dextran derivative and methylmethacrylate (MMA) (Suncon Mild II(TM), 12 Dk), and 3) oxygen-permeable-HCL composed of a copolymer of a monomer containing silicone, a monomer containing fluorine, and MMA (RGPL-A, 216 Dk). Cell injury rates were significantly different among these HCLs (Suncon Mild II(TM) < PMMA < RGPL-A) although there were no differences in rotatory rubbing forces. The smoothness of HCL surface, the qualities of injured cell layers observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the water wettability of HCLs were not correlated with cell injury rate. These results suggest that physicochemical properties of materials other than rotatory rubbing force, smoothness, and water wettability were involved in the cell injury. Our evaluation method for biomaterials that injure the corneal endothelial cells by dynamic contact should be very useful for the development of biomaterials or medical devices, including HCLs and intracardiac and urethral catheters.

Furthermore it was found that the terpolymer is markedly radiopaque: even thin objects (<0.5 mm) could be easily visualized using X-ray fluoroscopic techniques as are routinely used in the clinic, e.g., during coronary angiography. The combined results obtained with the present terpolymer (particularly its in vitro hemocompatibility and its radiopacity) leads to the suggestion that this type of polymer could be used as cardiovascular biomaterials, for instance for the construction of a new type of endovascular stents. These would be expected to show improved biocompatibility if compared with metallic stents which are currently used, for instance in conjunction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). A stent prototype, constructed from the present radiopaque terpolymer, is shown and discussed briefly. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons.

The symposium examined issues relating to the biocompatibility and clinical role of alloplastic materials commonly used for facial bone and soft-tissue replacement and augmentation, It provided a forum for the interaction of basic scientists, clinicians, and manufacturers. Clinical and laboratory data concerning a variety of implantable materials were presented and discussed. The program consisted of three parts. The first session was designed to provide historical and scientific background as well as perspective on legal issues surrounding the use of implantable biomaterials. The second session involved the presentation of clinical data on bone and bone substitutes for augmentation of the facial skeleton. The third session was devoted to clinical reports of bone and bone substitutes used for the reconstruction of cranial vault and cranial base skull defects.","MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP,DIV PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02114; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA; GEORGETOWN UNIV,MED CTR,DIV PLAST SURG,WASHINGTON,DC 20057",,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,0,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

The experimental difficulties associated with the application of this technique to the study of biological materials include the effects of ultra-high vacuum, x-ray exposure, surface charging, and, for insulating materials, the inherent lack of an intrinsic energy reference. Since most biological materials are insulators, the lack of an intrinsic energy reference complicates one's ability to draw direct comparisons between different studies. In this paper, the results from two different apatites are compared with the results obtained from the use of two conventional techniques for referencing binding energies. The results presented here are referenced only to the Pt Fermi level; no further energy modifications are performed. A comparison with the results of other investigators indicates a large difference in binding energies for all involved core levels. These results indicate that, in the study of insulating materials with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is essential that all data be acquired under exacting conditions on the same experimental system.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH DENT,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108; NYU,DENT CTR,NEW YORK,NY 10010","Wieliczka, DM (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT PHYS,1110 EAST 48TH ST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64110, USA.",,,"Spencer, Paulette/0000-0003-1447-826X","NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09696, DE00260]",,,7,10,10,0,4,AMER ASSOC DENTAL RESEARCH,ALEXANDRIA,"1619 DUKE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314",0022-0345,,,J DENT RES,J.

The purpose of this study was to test percutaneous injectable bone biomaterials with a reproducible model. A closed cancellous bone defect was created in the distal femoral extremities of 34 rabbits. Filling was done by a percutaneous injection made on the medial side, after the defect had been hollowed by a lateral approach. Three situations were tested: unfilled, filled with orthopaedic cement, filled with a soft collagen-hydroxyapatite material. Three time intervals (2, 4 and 8 weeks) were tested for the three situations. For the mixed hydroxyapatite-collagen material, each component was tested separately: the injectable collagen, and the hydroxyapatite powder. The quality of the defect was assessed by the variations of the defect area on sagittal sections. Bone formation in the defect was quantified for each group and time interval. A bone defect of reproducible size was obtained. Evolution of bone formation was different in each group. An unfilled defect was never completely filled by bone and the defect bone formation rate stayed between 9.9% and 15.1% without any statistical difference between the time intervals. The percutaneous injection of orthopaedic cement, which was progressive, was less complete than an opened surgical filling and explained a frequent low peripheral bone formation. A lower bone formation rate was observed in all the filled groups (orthopaedic cement, hydroxyapatite-collagen, hydroxyapatite and collagen) than in the control unfilled group. This study showed the use of bone biomaterials by an injectable percutaneous method, and a model to evaluate these materials is proposed.","CTR HOSP VICTOR PROVO,F-79100 ROUBAIX,FRANCE","Pasquier, G (reprint author), INST CALOT,INST RECH MALAD SQUELETTE,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE.",,,"Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,17,39,39,0,4,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

This study analyzed effects of surface finish and diamond-like carbon coating on osteoblast cell adhesion to polished titanium-aluminum-vanadium and polished or grit-blasted cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys. Osteoblast binding was tested in the presence and absence of the cell adhesion proteins fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin and was quantified by measurement of DNA content. Although adherence occurred in serum-free medium, maximal osteoblast binding required serum and was similar for titanium and cobalt alloys at 2 and 12 hours. With the grit-blasted cobalt alloy, cell binding was reduced 48% (p < 0.05) by 24 hours. Coating the alloys with diamond-like carbon did not alter osteoblast adhesion, whereas fibronectin pretreatment increased cell binding 2.6-fold (p < 0.05). In contrast, fibrinogen, vitronectin: and laminin did not enhance cell adhesion. These results support the hypothesis that cell adhesion proteins can modify cell binding to orthopaedic alloys. Although osteoblast binding was not affected by the presence of diamond-like carbon, this coating substance may influence other longer term processes, such as bone formation, and deserves further study.","STANFORD UNIV,MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT FUNCT RESTORAT,ORTHOPAED RES LAB,STANFORD,CA 94305; STANFORD UNIV,SCH ENGN,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305; WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ST LOUIS,MO",,,,,,,,40,41,43,1,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Disadvantages are high rates of local wound complications and restriction of mobility by the rigid ''shell''.

The initial textile testing reveals relevant differences in structure with marked asymmetry in the different directions. The materials are implanted as inlay in rats for 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days. The deformation of the abdominal wall following intraabdominal pressure of 0-70 mmHg (0-9.81 kPa) is documented by 3D-photogrammetry, the tensile strength by tearing of excised strips of mesh. Three commercial available materials and two laboratory modifications lead independently of their textile characteristics to a marked restriction of the rounded configuration of the abdominal wall. The tensile strength exceeds by far the physiologically necessary value of 16 N/cm. Three newly developed meshes made of multifilament polypropylene with reduced amounts of material (21% and 28% relative to Marlex(R)) lead to no restriction of the abdominal wall configuration yet have uncompromised stability.

The resultant coatings were characterised using electron microscopical and X-ray diffraction techniques. The mechanical properties were tested using a microhardness indentation technique, the results from which were used to give some indication of the strength and adhesion of the coatings. A model has been proposed to explain the observed phenomena in the precipitation and deposition processes. Amorphous calcium phosphate forms initially in the form of spheres. These spheres coalesce to form gel-like sheets in which hydroxyapatite nucleates. The gel sheets are attracted electrophoretically to the cathode where they are deposited as cells.

We are using this method of surface modification in our search for artificial surfaces with optimized blood compatibility. As a part of this work, two pivotal questions are now addressed: (i) what is the surface density of coupled molecules that can be reached by this method and (ii) is binding to the surface really covalent? After the photochemical coupling of 2 to a PEU surface, the ester bonds of the coupled molecules were selectively hydrolyzed with 0.1 M NaOMe/MeOH and the concentration of fluorescent molecules in solution determined spectrofluorometrically. Since not all of the fluorescent molecules were removed by this procedure, an additional experiment was performed (in which the polymer was completely dissolved). It was found that 25 nmol/cm(2) had coupled to the outermost polymer layers and 7.7 nmol/cm(2) to polymer layers more within the material (unreachable for the NaOMe/MeOH reagent). In another experiment a modified PEU sheet was dissolved in THF, after which MeOH was added to precipitate it again. From the fact that no fluorescence was detected in solution it could be concluded that all of the fluorescent molecules were indeed covalently coupled to the polymer surface.","MAASTRICHT UNIV,CTR BIOMAT RES,NL-6200 MD MAASTRICHT,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,28,14,14,1,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,OCT 21,1996.0,29,22,,,,,7012,7015,,10.1021/ma960279x,,,,4,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,VN888,WOS:A1996VN88800007,,,,,2019-02-25

The results of our investigation suggest that two-phase aqueous micellar systems of the type examined in this article are indeed potentially useful as extractant phases for the separation or concentration of proteins and other biomaterials.

Explants surrounded by tissue are often fixed in formalin or glutaraldehyde to facilitate later pathological and histological analysis, but the subsequent removal of such fixed tissue from thermally sensitive and less chemically stable polymers, such as polyurethanes, poses major problems for the materials scientist, who does not wish to modify the chemical, physical or morphological characteristics of the underlying biomaterial. The present study has attempted to find a solution to this problem by exposing virgin specimens of the microporous polyurethane Vascugraft(R) vascular prosthesis to six different cleaning conditions, all known to be effective in removing fixed tissue. These conditions included the use of 20% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution for 48 h at room temperature, 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for 5 min at the boil, and 9, 10, 11 and 12 N hydrochloric acid for 48 h at room temperature. The appearance and chemical properties of the virgin and treated specimens were compared using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography for molecular weight and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. The use of temperatures close to the boil resulted in the formation of a translucent, rubbery material with gross changes in the microporous and microfibrous structure. The strongly acidic and alkaline conditions caused a loss in the surface carbonate group content. In addition, 12 N hydrochloric acid reduced the molecular weight and urethane content. Consequently, 9 N hydrochloric acid is recommended as the cleaning agent of choice for removing fixed tissue from this type of microporous polyurethane. Control experiments on virgin material should also be included in any cleaning protocol.

We have demonstrated that the rate of cross-linking in glutaraldehyde and epoxide homobifunctional reagents can be modulated by uniaxial stress (strain). Two poly(glycidyl ether) epoxides were used: Denacol(R) EX-810 (a small bifunctional reagent), and Denacol EX-512 (a large polyfunctional reagent). To prevent any possible effect from being masked by saturation of cross-linking sites, bovine pericardium was cross-linked to such an extent that the increase in collagen denaturation temperature, T-d, was one-half of the maximal rise achievable with each reagent. Uniaxial tensile stress of 0, 15, 124 or 233 kPa was applied during cross-linking. Cross-linking rate (as observed by increase in T-d) increased with increasing stress to a maximum at 124 kPa in glutaraldehyde at pH 7 but decreased in EX-810 at pH 7. In each case, the effect was small but statistically significant. No effect was observed with the larger EX-512. Cross-linking under increasing stress also showed systematic effects on mechanical properties: decreasing extensibility and plastic strain while increasing tensile strength. In each case, the effects of the epoxides were slightly different from those of glutaraldehyde. In preparation for the above experiments, studies of the effect of pH, temperature, and exposure time were carried out for each epoxide and (to a lesser extent) for glutaraldehyde. Again, systematic changes in mechanical properties were observed with increasing T-d. Conformational changes in collagen produced by mechanical stress (strain) modulate the rate of cross-linking and the resulting mechanical properties; however, the effects are sensitive to the reagent employed.

The results indicate that the tissue's shrinkage temperature behaviour is retained. The tissues do not appear to have been affected by surface layering with polypyrrole or poly(sodium 3-pyrrolyl-butanesulphonate) (PSPBS). The main influence on the shrinkage temperature appears to be the reaction conditions in producing the hybrids i.e. the solvent and the presence of FeCl3. Hybrids obtained from reactions where the solvent was acetic acid demonstrated irreversible denaturation giving a final lower shrinkage temperature than the original value. Ail tissues exposed to FeCl3 were found to have higher shrinkage temperatures. This has been attributed to transient coordination bonding between the metal ion and side groups on the amino acid. The single peak of PSPBS-tissue hybrids in acetic acid is probably associated with the effective penetration of the PSPBS into the tissue, permitting some interaction between the functionalities of the conducting polymer and collagen.

In the case of the agar diffusion test survival of cells is involved in the presence of the material to be tested. Further statements on the biological effects of a biomaterial require the use of cell cultures adapted to the tissue concerned and the underlying problem being investigated. In the present study, an osteoblast cell culture system with which implant surfaces in contact with bone can be tested as required by the relevant standards is described. Test bodies made of titanium, polystyrene or copper were used in the conventional agar diffusion test, and were also overgrown with fibroblasts or a cell line of foetal human osteoblasts. For the agar diffusion test, the test criterion was the extent of the inhibition area on staining with neutral red, while for the overgrowth, the mean cell diameter and the number of cells was employed. The phenotype of the osteoblast cell line was determined immunohistochemically by means of alkali ne phosphatase or immunohistologically by means of collagen I and osteocalcin. Calcification was demonstrated using the v. Kossa stain. In the case of the osteoblasts, a differentiation of a collagen I and alkaline phosphatase-positive phenotype over an osteocalcin-positive phenotype to an increase in calcium deposition was shown. As in the case of the agar diffusion test, direct overgrowth also revealed no cytotoxic effect for titanium and polystyrene. In contrast, a cytotoxic effect consisting in a decrease in the number of cells and also a left shift in the size distribution was observed for copper. The standard deviations of the individual tests were less for overgrowth than for the agar diffusion test. The culture system for osteoblast cells thus meets the criteria of the EN/DIN 30993-5 in terms of the quality and accuracy of the results obtained. In addition to excluding direct cytotoxicity, this test system offers a new possibility of examining the influence of the material on cell growth. Consequently, it permits a repeatable examination of proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts on each material surface.","UNIV WURZBURG,LEHRSTUHL EXPT ZAHNMED,WURZBURG,GERMANY","Hendrich, C (reprint author), UNIV WURZBURG,ORTHOPAD KLIN,KONIG LUDWIG HAUS,BRETTREICHSTR 11,D-97074 WURZBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,,,15,11,11,0,5,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

We and others have provided evidence that direct interaction, an interaction that we believe is essential for the stabilization, between the sugar and polar groups in, for example, proteins and phospholipids occurs in the dry state. Some researchers, however, have suggested that the ability of the sugar to form a glass is the only requirement for stabilization. More recently, we have shown that both glass formation and direct interaction of the sugar and headgroup are often required for stabilization. In the present study, we present a state diagram for trehalose glass and suggest that the efficacy of this sugar for stabilization may be related to its higher glass transition temperatures at all water contents. We also show that trehalose and trehalose:liposome preparations form trehalose dihydrate as well as trehalose glass when rehydrated with water vapor. Formation of the dihydrate sequesters water, which might otherwise participate in lowering the glass transition temperature to below ambient. Because samples remain in the glassy state at ambient temperatures, viscosity is high and fusion between liposomes is prevented.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT FOOD SCI & TECHNOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","Crowe, LM (reprint author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,SECT MOL & CELL BIOL,STORER HALL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,33,405,420,0,77,BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Bacterial biofilms were produced in the modified Bobbins device using continuous culture flow at 60 ml/h for 40-44 h, and the sessile organisms were then exposed to either ciprofloxacin or tobramycin at a range of concentrations for 12 or 36h. The BEC of ciprofloxacin was 5 mu g/ml for the 12 and 36 h treatments, a value 10 x greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). In contrast, the BEC of tobramycin was >100 mu g/ml after 12h and 75 mu g/ml following 36 h of drug exposure, that is 75-100 x the MIC and MBC. The results demonstrated that the BEC is a more suitable indicator of the antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms than the MIC and MBC. Ciprofloxacin was significantly more effective than tqbramycin in the treatment of P. aeruginosa adherent to biomaterials. With respect to clinical application, if the intention of antibiotic use is to eradicate bacteria adherent to devices, only biofilm-active agents should be used.

This approach may be useful for enhancing the fixation of orthopedic implants. p-Nitrophenyl chloroformate (p-NPC) was used to immobilize protein on bulk samples of Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. Activation of both materials was dependent on the concentration of p-NPC, with a maximum of approximately 1.5 active groups/nm(2) of nominal surface area. Trypsin was used as a model protein because much is known about its structure and mode of action. Derivatization with 0.65 mg p-NPC/cm(2) resulted in significantly greater enzymatic activity (7.4 BAEE [N-(alpha)-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester hydrochloride] units) on the Co-Cr-Mo samples compared with higher concentrations of p-NPC (5 BAEE units) and with simple adsorption of trypsin (1.5 BAEE units). An activity of 10.5 BAEE units was measured on both adsorbed and p-NPC-activated Ti-6Al-4V, with the exception of samples derivatized with 1.95 mg p-NPC/cm(2), on which activity was significantly lower (4 BAEE units). In probing the linkages between trypsin and biomaterial by treatment with chaotropic agents, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was observed to eliminate more enzymatic activity than was urea. On Co-Cr-Mo samples, GuHCl removed nearly all the trypsin activity, while urea significantly decreased the activity only at a concentration of 0.65 mg r-NPC/cm(2). Treatment of Ti-6Al-4V samples with GuHCl caused a trend of decreasing activity with increasing concentration of p-NPC, whereas urea had no effect on immobilized trypsin activity.

The immunostaining method developed seemed to be a reliable technique to stain proteins in undecalcified sections. Biocompatibility results of the NiTi screws compared with the other screws showed a slower osteogenesis process characterized by no close contact between implant and bone, disorganized migration of osteoblasts around the implant, and a lower activity of osteonectin synthesis.

The morphological study revealed a diversity of structures having a minimal relative porosity of 70%, high bursting, and suture retention strengths in comparison with natural muscular tissue. Elasticmoduli proved to depend more on the direction of the textile: the rigidity was higher for those materials having tight structure, like the Fluoropassiv(R) and the Surgipro(TM) meshes (>30 MPa), whereas those with more open structures, such as the Marlex(R), Trelex(R), Lars(R), Bard Teflon(R), and GoreTex(R) structures, showed lower elastic modulus (10 mPa). In addition, chemical analyses confirmed no irregularities in the polymers used in all prostheses and demonstrated that the fluoropolymer coating of the Fluoropassiv(R) was uniformly distributed. The innovative aspects in the construction of the knitted fabric Fluoropassiv(R) appears to make it suitable for repairing hernias, and the inclusion of both continuous fluoropolymer surface treatment of polyester fibers and gelatin impregnation appears to improve the healing process.

All of the assays investigated showed a highly significant ''edge'' effect when within-plate reproducibility was examined; between-plate reproducibility was good for all assays except the MTT assay. When the assays were tested on cells adherent on biomaterials, there was a wide variation in the results obtained; in particular, the MTS assay showed poor reproducibility in the presence of materials. The MTT and BrdU assays both showed sufficient precision to detect cells on two of the materials studied. The study demonstrates that colorimetric assays are potentially useful in biocompatibility assessment but must be fully validated for the application chosen.","INTERDISCIPLINARY RES CTR BIOMED MAT,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND; QUEENS MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT HUMAN MORPHOL,NOTTINGHAM NG7 2UH,ENGLAND","Clifford, CJ (reprint author), INST ORTHOPAED,BROCKLEY HILL,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,29,24,26,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Three surfaces known to be difficult to evaluate were chosen to be measured on the same area with the two instruments. The measurements from the optical and the contact stylus profilometer were compared with each other and with measurements obtained from high-resolution atomic force microscopy, which served as a reference instrument. Six implants manufactured from commonly used biomaterials were also measured on the same part of the implant, but not on the same area, with the optical and the contact profilometer in order to stimulate the measurements that would be performed wizen different laboratories measure similarly treated surfaces. The numerical and visual differences achieved when measuring the same area with the two instruments investigated were compared. In general, we found an underestimation of the surface features with the contact stylus measurement and an overestimation with the confocal scanner The stylus readings are mainly influenced by the radius of the stylus tip, the pressure of the stylus tip on the surface, and the hardness of the material the optical profilometer has a tendency for creating spikes when surfaces with deep slopes are measured. For relatively soft metallic biomaterials, we found that using the optical instrument is the most appropriate method for surface roughness characterization, particularly when screw-shaped implants are analysed, whereas the stylus is preferred when larger areas with substantial slopes within the surface structure are to be evaluated.

Different types of samples were produced by conventional and shear-controlled injection molding (Scorin) and tested under tensile and impact loading. The behavior of three distinct grades is discussed in terms of the respective fracture morphology (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy). A comparison is made between the behavior of conventional and Scorim samples. The results show that the mechanical properties of the materials used were significantly improved by the employment of the Scorim process. The stiffness values of the conventional moldings were doubled, without reducing the ductility of the polymer. The impact data showed a material sensitivity, and consequent loss of properties, to the localized shear imposed to the melt during processing. This situation is attributed to very narrow mold gates (in the case of pingated systems) and leads to much reduced impact performance.","FEUP, DEPT MET ENGN, P-4099 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; INST BIOMED ENGN, INEB, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO, DEPT POLYMER ENGN, P-4800 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL; BRUNEL UNIV, WOLFSON CTR MAT PROC, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND",,,"Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008; Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012","Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Cunha M., Antonio/0000-0003-3860-7732",,,,13,64,66,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1042-7147,,,POLYM ADVAN TECHNOL,Polym.

However, the mechanism of this in vivo platelet adhesion has yet to be studied extensively. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a practical assay method for assessing platelet adhesion under flow conditions. We have devised an assay method (the fluorescent adhesion assay) that is based on the technique originally reported by Hubbell and McIntire (Biomaterials 7:354, 1986) with some modifications to make it more amenable for assaying small samples and have developed an analysis method to quantify the extent of platelet adhesion and aggregation from fluorescence images by using a computer-assisted image analysis system. In our assay, platelet adhesion, expressed as the percentage of the area covered by adhered platelets, was found to increase biphasically as a function of time. In the first phase, platelets interacted with the coated collagen, transiently stopping on the surface; we called this reaction the temporary arrest. In the second phase. platelets adhered much more rapidly and permanently on the surface, and this adhesion was dependent on the shear rate; platelets formed aggregates in this phase. We used our assay to analyze the effects of platelet aggregation inhibitors on platelet adhesion. All three examined inhibitors, EDTA (10 mmol/L), antiglycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, and GRGDS peptide (1 mmol/L), inhibited the second phase adhesion in flowing blood. Furthermore, GPVI-deficient platelets also showed defective second-phase adhesion under the same conditions. These results suggested that GPIIb/IIIa activation and GPVI contribute to the reaction inducing the second phase. The second-phase adhesion has been extensively investigated, and the consensus is that this reaction is mainly attributable to the platelet-platelet interaction. In this report, we were able to detect an earlier reaction, the temporary arrest. This temporary arrest would reflect the fast and weak interaction between platelet GPIb/IX and collagen-von Willebrand factor complexes on the collagen-coated surface.

This study was conducted to investigate the impact of the preservation method of bioprosthetic heart valve materials on calcification rates and biocompatibility of the biologic tissue. Methods. In subcutaneous rat implants, conventionally preserved bioprosthetic heart valve material was compared with bovine pericardium that was treated with L-glutamic acid to reduce residual glutaraldehyde released from the fixed tissue. Both these methods were compared with bovine pericardium that was stabilized by a dye-mediated photooxidation reaction without glutaraldehyde. Biocompatibility of these biomaterials was tested in vitro using human endothelial cell cultures. Results. Conventionally preserved bovine pericardium with a high amount of glutaraldehyde incorporated into the tissue resulted in severe calcification 63 days after subcutaneous implantation in rats (165.4 +/- 20 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). postfixation treatment with L-glutamic acid, which reduces free, unbound aldehyde groups, showed a significant decrease in calcification (89.6 +/- 14 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). Glutaraldehyde-free preservation by dye-mediated photooxidation showed no calcification after 63 days of subcutaneous implantation (1.0 +/- 0.4 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). Regular endothelial cell proliferation was observed on photooxidized and L-glutamic acid-treated tissue, whereas conventionally treated tissue caused endothelial cell death. Conclusions. This study underlines the detrimental role of glutaraldehyde in the calcification process of bioprosthetic heart valve materials and emphasizes alternative preservation methods that reduce or avoid the use of glutaraldehyde.","UNIV VIENNA,ZENTRUM BIOMED FORSCH,VIENNA,AUSTRIA; VET UNIV VIENNA,INST HISTOL & EMBRYOL,A-1030 VIENNA,AUSTRIA","Grabenwoger, M (reprint author), UNIV VIENNA,DEPT CARDIOTHORAC SURG,WAHRINGER GURTEL 18-20,A-1090 VIENNA,AUSTRIA.",,,"Windberger, Ursula/0000-0002-5800-9089",,,,22,56,60,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0003-4975,,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

Patency was assessed macroscopically, and the grafts were examined microscopically. The anti thrombogenicity of the vascular prostheses heparinized by thermal cross-linking was good in comparison with that of the control group. However, on the outer surface of the grafts, the author found more infiltration of fibroblasts into the wall of the control grafts than in the heparinized grafts. The author surmised that heparinized gelatin injected into the interfibril space of the graft inhibited cellular infiltration. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was slight in both grafts. Thus, the author was successful in heparinizing the vascular prostheses by thermal cross-linking and obtaining slow release of heparin to maintain early antithrombogenicity.

A lysosomal marker was used to assess the incidence of infiltrating extracellular matrix degrading cells. The major biochemical features that were associated with tissue degeneration and bioprosthetic heart valve failure were increased levels of MMP 9, high levels of beta-glucuronidase, and constant levels of active collagenase and MMP 2. The MMPs extracted from ruptured bioprostheses were inhibited by calcium chelators and zinc binding compounds.

The release from the implants and the tissue distribution of implanted GFs were determined in vivo using radiolabelled FGF-2. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of capillaries present in each Dacron(R) histological serial section. Radiolabelled GF was rapidly released from matrices and was absent from them by day 28. A very low percentage of the implanted radiolabelled GFs was found in the kidneys and livers of the animals. The number of microvessels formed within fibrin-impregnated samples was increased in the presence of HA and EGGS at 14d and of FN and EGGS or FGF-2 at 28d. FGF-1 had no direct effect on angiogenesis in our model. These results indicate that. enhancement of vascularization within prosthesis mesh may be achieved by using fibrin as a support for angiogenic molecules such as HA, FN and FGFs.

Stents find clinical use in interventional cardiology, in conjunction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). It is put forward that the stent prototype presented herein has, at least in principle, some advantages over existing (metallic) stents; these advantages are primarily owing to the unique combination of X-ray visibility and haemocompatibility which is presently achieved.

Previous studies have shown that biomaterials can activate macrophages to produce cytokines and promote an inflammatory response. Although the toxicity of many metal ions has been extensively investigated, little is known about the ability of these ions to alter cytokine release from macrophages. Yet the release of these ions from biomaterials has been well documented. Previous studies indicated that alterations in cytokine release might be expected because metal ions alter protein production in macrophages at sub-toxic concentrations. Thus, the hypothesis of this study was that metal ions can alter the secretion of cytokines from macrophages at sub-toxic concentrations. Methods. The release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from macrophages was investigated when the macrophages were exposed to metal ions, with or without lipopolysac charide (LPS), a component of dental plaque. Human THP-1 macrophages were exposed to ions of Ag, Au, Cu, Hg, and Ni for 24 h. In half of the cultures, LPS was added for the last 4 h. The release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha into the medium was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison intervals were used to compare the various experimental conditions. Results. None of the metal ions elevated the IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha levels after 24 h, but Ni ions significantly elevated the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels after 72 h. With LPS added, Ag, Cu, and Ni significantly amplified the LPS-induced production of IL-1 beta but only Ni amplified the TNF-alpha response. These alterations in cytokine response occurred with metal ion concentrations which have been previously shown to be released from dental alloys in vitro and in vivo. Significance. it appeared plausible that macrophage-cytokine mediated inflammatory responses may be altered by the presence of some metal ions in tissues, particularly Ni.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL SURG & MED,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","Wataha, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,35,50,53,0,4,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

Our approach makes use of the McMillan-Mayer solution theory to construct a Gibbs free energy model of the solution. This approach has the following desirable features: (i) the molecular structures of the solute species as well as their interactions are explicit inputs, and, therefore, the application of the theory is not restricted to a particular system, and (ii) the accuracy of the theory can be systematically improved, since the various approximations involved in constructing the solution Gibbs free energy model are clearly delineated. We illustrate the practical implementation of the theoretical framework by examining three cases. First, the theory is utilized in the context of a truncated virial expansion in solution concentration to derive an expression for the solute partition coefficient. Second, the theory is utilized to model protein partitioning in two-phase aqueous surfactant solutions. Third, the theory is utilized to qualitatively predict the partitioning behavior of proteins in a model two-phase aqueous polymer solution, accounting explicitly for the semidilute nature of the concentrated polymer solution phase, We find that the theory captures many of the salient experimental trends observed in protein partitioning in two-phase aqueous polymer solutions.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA; MIT, CTR MAT SCI & ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,"Lue, Leo/E-7846-2011","Lue, Leo/0000-0002-4826-5337",,,,41,22,22,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

To address the deficiencies with the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue, a new fixative, epoxy compound, was used to fix biological prostheses, The study was undertaken to investigate the fixation rates and crosslinking densities of biological tissues fixed with various epoxy compounds. These epoxy compounds are different in their chemical structures, Glutaraldehyde was used as a control, The fixation rates and crosslinking densities of the fixed tissues were determined by measuring their fixation indices and denaturation temperatures, respectively. Generally, the epoxy-fixed tissues were more pliable than the glutaraldehyde-fixed one. Furthermore, the tissues fixed with monofunctional epoxy compound were more pliable than those fixed with multifunctional epoxy compounds. With increasing pH or temperature, the fixation rate of epoxy compound increased, However, the number of epoxide functional groups did not seem to affect the fixation rate of the epoxy compound. The fixation rate of glutaraldehyde was faster than that of epoxy compounds, Additionally, the crosslinking density of the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue was greater than that of the epoxy-fixed counterparts, Moreover, it was noted that the denaturation temperatures of the tissues fixed with glutaraldehyde or multifunctional epoxy compounds were significantly higher than the fresh ones (p <0.05), while that fixed with monofunctional epoxy compound stayed roughly the same throughout the entire fixation process (p >0.05). The results obtained in this study may be used to optimize the fixation process for developing bioprostheses fixed with epoxy compounds.

In this study, the activation of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by the products from a rabbit synovial cell line (HIG-82) stimulated by various particles was investigated using rabbit unfractionated bone cells cultured on a dentin slice. The HIG cells were challenged with the following laboratory-made particles: high-density polyethylene (PE), cobalt alloy (Co-Cr), titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), pure titanium (Ti), and sintered hydroxyapatite (HA). The size of each particle was <2 mu m. The supernatants from HIG cells cultured with the appropriate concentration of wear particles were added to unfractionated bone cells on a dentin slice, and then resorbed areas were determined for each particle. Interestingly, resorbed areas significantly increased only when the culture medium from HIG cells with PE particles was added to unfractionated bone cells. This study demonstrates that PE particles stimulate the rabbit synovial cells to produce soluble factors that induce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Moreover, this experimental model is a useful method sensitively to evaluate the effects of soluble factors from the cells stimulated by particulate biomaterials from joint prostheses on osteoclastic bone resorption.

We hypothesize that the extent of complement activation is modulated by biomaterial formulation and the presence of fluid shear stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested base poly(etherurethane ureas) formulated with or without Santowhite(R) antioxidant, a nucleophilic additive. We found that adherent leukocyte densities decreased with increasing shear stress. Moreover, leukocyte adhesion was decreased significantly further by Santowhite(R) additive under shear stress but not under static conditions. Monocytes showed a higher propensity for adhesion than did neutrophils under shear and static conditions. Under static conditions, adherent cells on the Santowhite(R)-containing polyurethane had a slightly more activated morphology than those on the base polyurethane. Cell adhesion under shear stress was significantly decreased when C3 or fibronectin was depleted from the suspension medium. Santowhite(R) additive increased Factor B adsorption to the test surface while shear stress increased Factor H adsorption. The combination of Santowhite(R) additive and shear stress increased the adsorption of both Factor B and Factor H and the serum protein S-terminal complement complex levels, but it did not further increase the state of activation of adherent cells. We conclude the leukocyte adhesion on poly(etherurethane urea) surfaces is sensitive to the levels of shear stress and that both C3 and fibronectin are required to maintain adhesion in the presence of shear stress. The low state of cellular activation and increased Factor H adsorption may explain the decreased adherent leukocyte density on the Santowhite(R)-containing polyurethane.

Methods: Discs of test materials were glued to specially designed plastic (Delrin(R)) buttons and implanted into the superior and inferior venae cavae of sheep through a right thoracotomy. The button and disc had such configuration that the blood flow was minimally disturbed. Up to four different materials could be tested simultaneously in each animal: two in superior vena cava and two in inferior vena cava. The materials and their respective implantation sites were changed between different animals according to the Latin square principle. Ten animals were used. Three materials currently used in mechanical heart valve prostheses - titanium, cobalt-chromium alloy (Haynes 25(R)) and pyrolytic carbon (Pyrolite(R) - together with a surface modified (methylated) titanium were evaluated. No heparin was given during the experiment. After two hours of testing, the discs were explanted and evaluated for hemocampatibility. The thrombus area on each disc was measured with photography and planimetry. Platelet and leukocyte adhesion on the surfaces were quantitatively assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that there were significant differences in thrombus formation (p = 0.001) and leukocyte adhesion (p = 0.002) between the materials tested.

The authors have compared the effects of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and glutaraldehyde (the de facto industrial standard crosslinker) on the hydrothermal, biochemical, and uniaxial mechanical properties of bovine pericardium. EDC crosslinking was optimized for maximum increase in collagen denaturation temperature using variables of pH, concentration, and ratio of EDC to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS): a reagent for formation of activated esters. EDC and glutaraldehyde crosslinked materials were subjected to hydrothermal denaturation tests, biochemical degradation by enzymes (collagenase, trypsin) and CNBr, amino acid analysis for unreacted lysine, and to high strain rate mechanical tests including: large deformation stress-strain studies (0.1 to 10 Hz), stress relaxation experiments (loading time 0.1 s) and small deformation forced vibration (1 and 10 Hz). A protocol for EDC crosslinking was developed which used 1.15% EDC (2:1 EDC:NHS) at pH 5.5 for 24 h. The increase in denaturation temperature for EDC (from 69.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C to 86.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C) was equivalent to that produced by glutaraldehyde (85.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C). Both treatments equivalently increased resistance to collagenase and CNBr degradation; however, after denaturation, the EDC-treated tissue was slightly more resistant to collagenase, and markedly more resistant to trypsin. EDC-treated materials were more extensible and more elastic than glutaraldehyde-treated materials. Despite the differences in crosslinking mechanism, EDC and glutaraldehyde-treated materials are very similar. Subtle but intriguing differences in biochemical structure remain to be investigated.",,"Lee, JM (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO, ON M5S 1A1, CANADA.",,,,,,,68,86,90,4,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

This study examines the spinal fusion enhancement potential of some osteoconductive and osteoinductive biomaterials. METHODS: Four similar canines received unilateral posterolateral fusions on the left side at T13-L1 and L4-L5 and on the right side at L2-L3 and L6-L7. The experiments were grouped as follows: Group A, autogenous bone harvested from the iliac crest; Group B, autogenous bone and collagen; Group C, no implant; and Group D, autogenous bone, collagen, and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2. Radiographic assessment, three-dimensional computed tomographic volumetric analysis, and biomechanical testing were performed at each level. RESULTS: For Groups A and B, the fusions demonstrated moderate bone formation at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Group D fusions exhibited earlier and more dramatic increases in volume and radiodensity and eventually were comparable in size to the vertebral bodies. Average fusion volumes computed from three-dimensional computed tomographic analysis were: Group A = 1.243 cc, Group B = 0.900 cc, Group C = 0.000 cc, and Group D = 6.668 cc (P = 0.003 compared to Group A). Group D exhibited flexion and extension biomechanical properties much greater than controls. The addition of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 consistently yielded the strongest fused segments and, on average, enhanced extension stiffness by 626% and flexion stiffness by 1120% over controls. CONCLUSION: The most advantageous spinal fusion implant matrix consisted of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2, autogenous bone, and collagen. Future investigators, however, need to examine the appropriate quantities of the individual components and clarify the efficacy of the matrix for the various types of spinal fusion approaches.","UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT RADIOL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA; UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA; UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOPHYS, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA","Sheehan, JP (reprint author), UNIV VIRGINIA, HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT NEUROL SURG, BOX 212, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22908 USA.",,,,,,,34,34,34,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0148-396X,1524-4040,,NEUROSURGERY,Neurosurgery,SEP,1996.0,39,3,,,,,548,554,,10.1097/00006123-199609000-00023,,,,7,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,VE304,WOS:A1996VE30400050,8875485.0,,,,2019-02-25

Many other devices, such as orthodontic appliances, surgical instruments and venous catheters, are treated to improve friction, fretting resistance and biocompatibility.

(1994) ACS Symp. Ser. 567, 134-147]. Preferentially excluded solutes are also known to stabilize quaternary structure, which enhances the thermostability of multimeric proteins in aqueous systems. Also, it has been suggested that retention of quaternary structure may play a role in the protection of multimeric proteins by polymers during freeze-drying (lyophilization). Although preferential solute exclusion cannot occur in the absence of water, we reasoned that polymers could protect multimeric proteins during freeze-drying by stabilizing quaternary structure in the frozen state. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis and demonstrate that bovine serum albumin and polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilize lactate dehydrogenase by inhibiting dissociation in the frozen solution, during the initial phase of the sublimation step of lyophilization. Dissociation at this critical step correlated directly with decreased recovery of enzyme activity after rehydration. The damage to the protein, under conditions where dissociation was studied, was due to a large decrease in pH in the frozen state (e.g., from pH 7.5 to 4.5), which was attenuated by protective levels of polymers. Thus, inhibition of freezing-induced pH shifts, in addition to stabilization by the preferential exclusion mechanism, plays an important role in the protection conferred by polymers. Furthermore, high concentrations of these polymers were capable of maintaining quaternary structure during subsequent drying and rehydration. We suggest that the proximate cause for increased recovery of active, native protein after lyophilization is that the holoenzyme is more resistant to the stresses of drying/rehydration than unassociated monomers.

Application to synthesis of polymeric biomaterials featuring intrinsic radiopacity,MACROMOLECULES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BLOOD COMPATIBLE POLYMERS,"The properties of co- and terpolymers (physical, mechanical, chemical, biocompatibility, etc.) strongly depend on their microstructural details. In the course of our research work on biomaterials that feature intrinsic radiopacity, we became interested in the microstructural details of co- and terpolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and 2-(2'-iodobenzoyl)ethyl methacrylate (1) or 2-(4'-iodobenzoyl)ethyl methacrylate (2). A new method, based on H-1-NMR at 400 MHz, was used to study the copolymerization reactions 1 + HEMA, 1 + MMA, 2 + HEMA, and 2 + MMA. This method was found to be convenient, fast, and accurate, and it is put forward that this approach can also be applied to study other copolymerization reactions. The results, obtained with the error-invariables method (EVM), are as follows: 1 + HEMA, r(1) = 1.09 +/- 0.14, r(HEMA) = 1.12 +/- 0.06; 1 + MMA, r(1) = 0.54 +/- 0.12, r(MMA) = 0.67 +/- 0.06; 2 + HEMA, r(2) = 2.18 +/- 0.72, r(HEMA) = 2.29 +/- 0.38; 2 + MMA, r(2) = 0.93 +/- 0.32, r(MMA) = 0.90 +/- 0.13. Based on these data, a triad analysis was performed. It is concluded that all four copolymerizations afford random-type macromolecules. Therefore, it is most likely that terpolymers consisting of 1 or 2, HEMA, and MMA will also have a random character. This conclusion is of interest, since it gives a better insight into the different biochemical and physicochemical properties of this type of co-/terpolymers. The results imply that random copolymers, built-up from a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic component, can also exhibit low thrombogenicity; this is in line with recent studies by Mathew et al.

Significant differences were observed among the volumes and white blood cell (WBC) counts of the pouch exudates, based on the various crystal types used to induce inflammation, A strong correlation was demonstrated between the specific surface (SS) area of the injected crystals and the area under the curve for induced WBC count versus time (R(2) = 0.88, P = 0.05), This correlation was observed for SS area values below 50 m(2)/gm, but when SS area increased further, this parameter plateaued, Another parameter of inflammatory response was obtained by dividing the area under the curve figuring WBC counts versus time by the corresponding SS area for each crystal type, This parameter increased linearly with the Ca:P ratio (R(2) = 0.97, P = 0.0003), Conclusion. The inflammatory potential of BCP crystals appeared to vary according to crystal features, SS area and the Ca:P ratio (which correlates with crystal solubility) influenced inflammatory properties, These results could explain the variable clinical consequences of BCP deposits, and must be taken into account in the choice of apatite ceramics for use as biomaterials.","ECOLE NATL SUPER CHIM,URA CNRS 445,TOULOUSE,FRANCE; LAB RECH ORTHOPED,URA CNRS 1432,PARIS,FRANCE","Prudhommeaux, F (reprint author), UNIV PARIS 07,HOP LARIBOISIERE,CTR VIGGO PETERSEN,LAB HISTOPATHOL SYNOVIALE ER 254,F-75475 PARIS 10,FRANCE.",,,,,,,46,48,48,1,4,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0004-3591,,,ARTHRITIS RHEUM,Arthritis Rheum.,AUG,1996.0,39,8,,,,,1319,1326,,10.1002/art.1780390809,,,,8,Rheumatology,Rheumatology,VB470,WOS:A1996VB47000008,8702440.0,,,,2019-02-25

Studies of drug sorption to new catheter materials are therefore important. Pellethane(TM), a polyurethane increasingly used in vascular access catheters, is as yet little studied in terms of its capacity for drug sorption. In this work a range of drugs known to be sorbed by PVC infusion sets were studied with respect to their sorption by Pellethane catheters. Standard lengths of catheter were incubated with solutions of drugs and samples of the solution were taken at intervals, assayed spectrophotometrically and compared with control solutions incubated without catheter. Losses from solution of up to 93% were found after 24 h. A series of highly sorbing and clinically relevant drugs was identified and their uptake was studied until equilibrium had been reached. A correlation was evident between the octanol/water partition coefficient and the fraction of drug taken up from solution at equilibrium, with the more hydrophobic drugs being taken up to a greater extent by the catheter.

The wide variety of polymeric biomaterials currently used for stent fabrication suggests that no single material is significantly superior to the others at resisting encrustation. A model representing upper urinary tract conditions was employed to compare the long-term struvite and hydroxyapatite encrustation of five materials currently used in the fabrication of ureteral stents. Silicone was least prone to struvite encrustation, followed by polyurethane, silitek, percuflex and hydrogel-coated polyurethane, in rank order. Similarly, silicone was least prone to hydroxyapatite encrustation, followed by silitek, polyurethane, percuflex and hydrogel-coated polyurethane.

Whereas nanoparticles made from PLA and stabilized by surfactants (PLA-F68) are rapidly phagocytized, the rate of phagocytosis is strongly reduced in case of nanoparticles made from a diblock copolymer (PLA-PEO). Because of the role of the complement system in opsonization, this difference of phagocytosis was hypothesized to be related to this system. An important complement consumption was obtained in 5 min in the presence of PLA-F68 particles. In the presence of a higher surface area of PLA-PEO particles possessing a high PEO surface density, the consumption remained very low. When the average PEO surface density was decreased on such particles below a given threshold, a fast and strong complement consumption occurred again. These experimental data support the concept of steric repulsion towards proteins, by surfaces covered with terminally attached PEO chains and emphasize the prime importance of PEO surface density in such an effect. The major, but probably not exclusive, role of complement as an opsonin capable of inducing a fast phagocytosis by MPS should be taken into account concerning the in vitro evaluation of nanoparticles as candidates for a long blood circulation.

Collagen (type III) was also linked with the carboxylic group of PAA grafted onto the SR surface via a carbodiimine agent to obtain a secondary structure of SR. The SR surface properties were characterized by ATR-FTIR, ESCA, contact angle, and SEM. The biocompatibility of the SR surface was evaluated by a culture of cornea epithelial (CE) cells. Subsequently, 75-450 mu g cm(-2) of pAA were obtained on the SR surfaces under different reactive conditions; 3-12 mu g cm(-2) of collagen were linked on modified surfaces of SR. Moreover, ATR-FTIR and ESCA were utilized to confirm the proceedings of these reactions. The hydrophility of the modified SR was measured by a contact angle meter. The values of contact angle for SR grafted with pAA were approximately 45-50 degrees; a 50-55 degrees contact angle on pAA-g-SR to be further linked with collagen was subsequently obtained. Moreover, the influence of surface properties toward migration, growth and attachment of CE cells on the modified surfaces was also examined. Here, untreated SR was used as a control. Experimental results indicated that the number of CE cells attached onto the controlled SR was negligible. The attach ment of cells onto pAA-grafted surfaces was clearly observed and peusopoda occurred; however, cell growth was depressed. This depression may have been caused by the acid environ ment of the pAA-grafted membrane. Nevertheless, both cell attachment and growth onto collagen-linked surfaces were significant. In addition, the morphology of the cells attached onto this surface was considered normal for primary cells. Collagen introduced on the SR surface was not denatured, i.e. the natural properties of collagen were maintained. The results obtained in this study will hopefully lead to the successful development of modified SR for clinical applications.

Several advantages of peat moss for such applications include its abundance, low cost, and high metal capacity. A Ca-loaded column of peat moss was therefore studied with mixtures of metals. Metals bind to anionic sites by displacing protons from acidic groups (K-ex(H)) or existing metals from anionic sites at high pH (K-ex). These ion-exchange equilibrium constants were determined in batch experiments by direct measurement of species in solution and sorbed on the solid phase.

Under conditions employed for a Mg/Mn mixture, it was found that ion-exchange equilibria were maintained along the column due to very fast rates for metal-metal exchange as measured in a separate kinetic study. A linear relationship for log K-ex(H) vs pH over 10(6) was interpreted as due to metal binding to sites of different acid strengths.","MESSIAH COLL,GRANTHAM,PA 17027; GEORGETOWN UNIV,DEPT CHEM,WASHINGTON,DC 20057",,,,,,,,27,120,122,1,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Clinically, these patients may require an ACL reconstruction. In an attempt to develop an improved ligament prosthesis, a prototype xenograft - an epoxy-fixed porcine Achilles tendon - was developed. The study was intended to investigate the crosslinking characteristics of the epoxy-fixed porcine tendons fixed at different pHs (4.0, 7.4, 9.0, and 10.5), temperatures (4, 25, and 37 degrees C), and fixative concentrations (1, 2, or 4%). Samples of each group were taken out at various elapsed fixation periods. The crosslinking characteristics-fixation index, denaturation temperature, and moisture content - of each sample were determined. Additionally, the stiffness of the epoxy-fixed tendons under various fixation conditions was qualitatively compared. Ln the study it was noted that the color of porcine Achilles tendons remained natural after epoxy fixation. With increasing pH, temperature, or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed tendons increased. However, the fixed porcine tendons tended to be stiffer at a higher pH, temperature, or fixative concentration. The moisture contents of the epoxy-fixed tendons were relatively lower than the fresh ones, while they were approximately the same at different pHs, temperatures, and fixative concentrations. The implications of these findings for the epoxy-fixed porcine tendons in ACL reconstruction require further investigation.

This is due (in part) to the failure of these materials to mimic the mechanical properties of the host tissue they replace. If bioprosthetic materials could be engineered to meet the mechanical performance required in vivo, the functional lifetime of implants would be increased. In this study, glutaraldehyde/solvent solutions of decreasing dielectric constant (polarity) were utilized to modify the properties of crosslinked collagen in whole bovine pericardial tissue. Solvents included phosphate buffer, methanol, 95% (w/w) ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol. Exogenous crosslinking was verified in collagen by thermal denaturation tests and amino acid analyses. Tensile mechanical behavior of collagenous pericardial samples was found to depend upon the dielectric constant (polarity) of the glutaraldehyde/solvent solutions employed; however, treatment in the solvents alone had little, if any, effect. As the dielectric constant of the solvents decreased, three mechanical properties were systematically altered: plastic strain fell from a mean of 8.9 +/- 1.5% (buffer) to 1.6 +/- 0.4% (n-butanol); strain at fracture increased from 32.2 +/- 2.6% (buffer) to 55.6 +/- 4.6% (n-butanol); and percent stress remaining after 1000-s stress relaxation from an 80-g initial load fell from 86.3 +/- 1.1% (buffer) to 76.9 +/- 1.0% (n-butanol). Crosslinking using a glutaraldehyde/n-butanol solution produced materials with tensile mechanical behavior that was very close to that of fresh tissue; however, the flexural properties of the treated tissue were different from those of fresh tissue. This decoupling of the flexural and tensile mechanical behaviors of crosslinked bioprosthetic materials is unique to this form of treatment. The observed phenomena may be the results of conformational changes in collagen facilitated by polar/nonpolar interactions with the solvent that are ''locked in'' by the action of glutaraldehyde. This technique may aid in the ''customized'' design of mechanical properties in tissue-derived biomaterials.

A 7 x 5 cm prosthesis of STP (n = 12) or MM (n = 12) was implanted into a defect of the same size (involving all layers except skin) created in the anterior abdominal wall in 24 New Zealand rabbits. The prostheses were anchored to the recipient tissue, in direct contact with the intestinal loops and connective tissue. After 14, 30, 60 and 90 days, groups of six implants were studied macroscopically and samples were taken to be processed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemical studies and tensiometry. All animals were valid for the study. In th ree cases STP implants presented very loose adhesions in the peripheral zones corresponding to the sutures. They were also observed on three MM implants, in the area of the perforations. Light and scanning microscopy revealed the formation of a capsule of scar tissue surrounding both types of prosthesis. At day 90, bridges of connective tissue had formed in the perforated areas of MM. Good vascularization was established in the areas of recipient tissue corresponding to both implants. The macrophage reaction to both biomaterials was maximal at 14 days, after which it progressively decreased until day 90. Tensile testing revealed no significant differences between the two biomaterials. It is concluded that (a) behaviour in the peritoneal interface is similar in the two prostheses, (b) both biomaterials become encapsulated rather than integrated into the recipient tissue, (c) the foreign body reaction does not determine the success or failure of the implants, (d) The perforations of the MM prosthesis do not increase its resistance to stress, or at least not after 90 days of implantation into rabbit abdominal wall.",,"Bellon, JM (reprint author), UNIV ALCALA DE HENARES, FAC MED, DEPT MORPHOL SCI & SURG, KM 33600, E-28871 MADRID, SPAIN.",,"Hernando, Antonio/E-2105-2015","Hernando, Antonio/0000-0001-7856-3768; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011",,,,14,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA in the HL60 cells cultured on various substrates and in Various conditions was studied. Expression of IL-1 beta could be successfully determined by RT-PGR analysis. A 48 h incubation period was necessary to clarify the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA.

The PMN were exposed to a shear stress of 0.19 Pa (1.9 dynes cm(-2)) or were allowed to adhere without the stress component (static control) during 30 min for all four biomaterials. Observation by light microscopy was performed in situ in the flow chamber at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. The total number of adherent cells as a function of time and the activation status of the population on the basis of morphological criteria were determined. On the hydrophilic material adhesion of activated PMN was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than on the more hydrophobic surfaces. This effect was most pronounced for the adhesion of neutrophils to glass and polypropylene (PP). Polyethylene (PE) showed only minor adhesion rates. Scanning electron microscopy revealed details of cell shape changes and permitted a more precise classification of populations of neutrophils based on distinctive shapes. As PMN were exposed to shear stress on glass, the majority of cells exhibited surface veils, ridges and ruffles, suggesting a high level of cell migration. In this case, on polymeric surfaces the presence of filopodial networks (FEP-Teflon) and ameoboid cell shapes (PP and PE) was noted. The results suggest that a low shear stress, as well as various chemical and physical properties of biomaterial surfaces, are together responsible for differentiation of PMN populations on solid substrata.

The objective was to test the effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the attempt to modulate the adhesive process, thus improving the biomaterial/visceral peritoneum interface. We have carried out an experimental study using the New Zealand white rabbit, implanting a 7 x 5 cm(2) polypropylene prosthesis into the anterior abdominal wall in such a way that it replaced all the tissue layers and was in contact with the intestinal loops. Three study groups were established: group I (control), in which only implantation of the biomaterial was performed; group II, in which the prosthesis was pretreated with a solution of PC; and group III, in which the implants were treated as in group II and the animals underwent intraperitoneal administration of 10 ml of the same solution. The animals were killed on postimplantation day 14. The total surface of the prosthesis occupied by adhesions was measured and light and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyse the healing process. In comparison with the controls, groups II and III did not present significant differences with respect to the resistance or extension of the adhesions. The microscopic results showed a rapid formation of disorderly and well-vascularised scar tissue enveloping the entire prosthesis. Thus, PC was unable to modulate the process of adhesion formation between the prosthesis and the organs of the abdominal cavity; nor did it induce changes in the cells of sufficient importance to alter the results of the healing process in the presence of this biomaterial.

Double layered collagenic matrices were prepared with purified collagens extracted from human placental tissues. Two types of patches were tested, the first constituted from a collagen type I+III layer covered by collagen IV in a liquid phase (patch I+III/IV) and the second from a collagen IV layer covered by liquid collagen IV (patch IV/IV). The matrices were applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic wall defect in the rat. Healing evolution was determined by macroscopic, microscopic and immunostaining studies. The reconstitution of the three colonic wall layers was achieved within 45 days without retraction or inflammatory reaction, while the biomaterial was resorbed. Human collagen I and III antibodies failed to stain extracellular matrix. This failure may be a consequence of outdated antibodies or more likely epitope alteration during extraction and preparation of the collagens. A human collagen type IV antibody staining of the scar zone showed the basement membranes of newly developed vessels within 10 days, and newly formed colonic mucosa within 20 days. The collagen reconstituted matrix was able to assist healing of normal digestive tract defects as shown by the labelling of the new synthesized extracellular matrix by collagen type IV antibody. These findings support the use of collagen biomaterial in gastro-intestinal anastomosis. This new surgical approach allowing healing of colonic wall defects could reduce occurrence of anastomotic leakage in human.

Structural forms have included bulk solids or particulates with and without porosities for tissue ingrowth, and more recently, coatings onto other types of biomaterial substrates. The physical shapes selected were application dependent, with advantages and disadvantages determined by: (1) the basic material and design properties of the device construct; and (2) the patient-based functional considerations. Most of the ceramics (bioceramics) selected in the 1960s and 1970s have continued over the long-term, and the science and technology for thick and thin coatings have evolved significantly over the past decade. Applications of ceramic biomaterials range from bulk (100%) ceramic structures as joint and bone replacements to fully or partially biodegradable substrates for the controlled delivery of pharmaceutical drugs, growth factors, and morphogenetically inductive substances. Because of the relatively unique properties of bioceramics, expanded uses as structural composites with other biomaterials and macromolecular biologically-derived substances are anticipated in the future.",,"Lemons, JE (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA,509 MED EDUC BLDG,1813 6TH AVE S,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294, USA.",,,,,,,48,33,33,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",8756-3282,,,BONE,Bone,JUL,1996.0,19,1,,S,,,S121,S128,,10.1016/S8756-3282(96)00128-7,,,,8,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,UW664,WOS:A1996UW66400010,8831003.0,,,,2019-02-25

Polyurethanes revisited,JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SMALL-DIAMETER; THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANES; ANASTOMOTIC HYPERPLASIA; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; PROSTHESES; ELASTOMER; HEPARIN; LEADS,"Polyurethanes are considered to be one of the most bio- and blood-compatible biomaterials known today. By intelligent utilization of principles governing the structure/property relationship of these polymers, one can generate systems which resemble, in principle, the physical-mechanical behavior of living tissue. Thus, it is not surprising that these materials played a major role in development of small caliber vascular grafts targeted for vascular access, peripheral and coronary artery bypass indications. Numerous technologies, often esoteric in nature, were and are utilized to generate porous, potentially multilayered conduits possessing some or many characteristics of natural blood vessels. Properties such as durability elasticity, compliance, pulsatility, and propensity for healing became attainable via polyurethanes. Furthermore, additional surface and/or bulk modification via attachments of biologically active species such as anticoagulants, cell proliferation suppressants, anti-infective compounds or biorecognizable groups are possible due to reactive groups which are part of the polyurethane structure. These modifications are designed to control or mediate host acceptance and healing of the graft. Finally, a myriad of practical processing technologies are used to fabricate functional grafts. Among those, casting, electrostatic and wet spinning of fibers and monofilaments, extrusion, dip coating or spraying of mandrels with polymer/additive solutions are often coupled with chemical-potential-difference-driven coagulation and phase inversion leading to grafts feeling and often behaving like natural vessels. Historically, the first polyurethanes utilized were hydrolytically unstable polyester polyurethanes containing hydrolysis-prone polyester polyols as soft segments, followed by hydrolytically stable but oxidation sensitive polyether polyols based polyurethanes. Polyether-based polyurethanes and their clones containing silicone and other modifying polymeric intermediates represented significant progress. Many viable technologies were discovered and developed using polyether-based polyurethanes. Chronic in vivo instability observed on prolonged implantation became, however, a major roadblock. The path led finally to the use of hydrolytically and oxidatively stable polycarbonate polyols as the soft segment to generate biodurable materials with resistance to biodegradation adequate for vascular access or perhaps peripheral graft indications. This biodurability needs to be further increased in order to utilize the full potential of polyurethanes in development of patent small caliber graft. Modification of both the soft and hard segments needs to be considered in order to maximize biodurability of both basic building blocks of the polyurethane. This paper reviews the achievements, discusses trends, and offers the view of the future in this exciting area of material/device combination.","CARDIOTECH INT INC, WOBURN, MA 01801 USA",,,,,,,,90,64,67,4,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0885-3282,1530-8022,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

A comparison with conventional metallic alloys used as articular implants is established. To determine the corrosion behavior we employed electrochemical methods: evaluation of corrosion potential E(corr), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and anodic polarization curves. The corrosion resistance of the MA-956 superalloy preoxidized at 1100 degrees C during 100 h is at least two orders of magnitude higher than for the other alloys. This satisfactory behavior is stationary with time. Also the probability of the appearance of the pitting corrosion process is very low. When cracking is generated in the alpha-alumina layer the repassivation process is assured because of the high Cr content in the superalloy. This study is the first step in proposing this new alloy as a biomaterial. The low toxicity of these metallic alloys in the physiological environment suggests that in vivo their biocompatibility could be satisfactory.

The measured light-scattering coefficients of the implant synovial fluid samples were significantly larger than the coefficients of the control samples (p < 0.0001). The enhanced light scattering was attributed to the presence of submicron UHMWPE particles. This is consistent with light-scattering considerations and a Raman spectroscopy survey of synovial fluid. The mean particle volume fraction of UHMWPE was 1.11 x 10(-5) cm(3)/mL for the six implant samples, with mean particle diameters in the range of 200-300 nm. The UHMWPE volume fractions were found to differ by a factor of 2 between the osteolytic and nonosteolytic cases. The current findings warrant further work to determine the role of submicron polyethylene debris in the wear mechanisms of biomaterials and in the development of osteolysis following total knee replacement.

When the surface of segmented polyurethane, in which endothelial cells are not capable of proliferating, is modified by carbon deposition, cell adhesion and proliferation occurred selectively on the carbon-deposited region. Carbon deposition to a tissue culture-treated polystyrene surface on which cells are capable of proliferating further promoted cell spreading and proliferation. Cell patterning on carbon-deposited segmented polyurethane was also attempted by controlling the direction or region of cell proliferation. Carbon deposition onto the polymer surface brought about a decrease in the water contact angle of the surface. Precoating fibronectin or laminin on the carbon-deposited polymer surface brought about cell adhesion and proliferation in the carbon-deposited region, but not in the non-carbon-deposited region. Our data suggest that promotion of cell proliferation on a carbon-deposited surface is probably due to selective adhesion of adhesive proteins to the surface.

In particular, the -OH functionality of the monomer is increasingly retained in the plasma generated thin films as the radio frequency duty cycle is lowered. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of the films obtained reveal that excellent film chemistry control is achieved during plasma polymerization of this monomer.

A heavy infiltrate of foreign body macrophages in response to biomaterial wear particles is commonly found in the fibrous membrane surrounding loose components. It has recently been shown that foreign body macrophages can differentiate into osteoclastic cells. To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of bone resorption have a role to play in controlling the osteolysis of aseptic loosening, we analyzed the effect of a bisphosphonate, disodium ethane-1, 1-diphosphonate (EHDP) on this process. Murine monocytes and foreign body macrophages (derived from granulomas formed by subcutaneous implantation of particles of prosthetic biomaterials) were co-cultured with UMR106 osteoblast-like cells in the presence of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D-3 for 14 days on glass coverslips and bone slices. EHDP significantly inhibited bone resorption in these co-cultures. There was little or no expression of the osteoclast-associated enzyme, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in EHDP-treated co-cultures. Addition of EHDP to monocyte-UMR106 co-cultures after the appearance of TRAP-positive cells did not abolish bone resorption, indicating that EHDP, in addition to its known inhibitory effect on osteoclast function, suppresses differentiation of osteoclast precursors. EHDP inhibition of the osteolysis induced by particulate biomaterial-associated macrophages shows that pharmacological inhibition of bone resorption might be used to control the osteolysis of aseptic loosening.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,DEPT PATHOL,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,NUFFIELD DEPT PATHOL & BACTERIOL,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND",,,,,Wellcome Trust,,,33,26,29,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0001-6470,,,ACTA ORTHOP SCAND,Acta Orthop.

This turn of events was made possible by an improved understanding of the biological response of living tissues to implants as well as clinical trials that validated the long-term success of these implants. Despite major structural differences between teeth and implants, such as the absence of a periodontal ligament around implants, the latter appear to provide a reliable functional replacement for their natural counterparts. This review briefly summarizes the major structural differences of the interfacial region of teeth and dental implants and their supporting tissues. It focuses on our current understanding of the soft and hard tissue responses to submerged and nonsubmerged root-form dental implants. The influence of a number of factors that affect the tissue response is reviewed, including biomaterials, implant design, surgical technique, and the local microbiota. Our recently acquired ability to modulate wound healing with guided tissue regeneration and growth factors will undoubtedly play an important role in the future utilization and success rates of dental implants.

Methods-Biomaterial particles (polymethylmethacrylate, high density polyethylene, titanium, chromium-cobalt, stainless steel) were implanted subcutaneously into mice. Macrophages were isolated from the foreign body granulomas that resulted, cultured on bone slices and coverslips, and assessed for both cytochemical and functional evidence of osteoclast differentiation. Results-Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) negative macrophages isolated from granulomas containing particles of all types of biomaterial composition were capable of differentiating into TRAP positive cells capable of extensive lacunar bone resorption (assessed by scanning electron microscopy). The presence of both UMR106 rat osteoblast-like cells and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-3 was necessary for this to occur. Conclusion-All implant materials produce wear particles that are the focus of a heavy foreign body macrophage response in the fibrous membrane between a loose implant component and the host bone undergoing resorption. These findings underline the importance of biomaterial wear particle generation and the macrophage response to different types of biomaterial wear particles in the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening.","UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,NUFFIELD DEPT PATHOL & BACTERIOL,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,MRC,BONE RES LAB,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND",,,"Murray, David/D-7117-2011",,Wellcome Trust,,,39,60,63,0,0,BRITISH MED JOURNAL PUBL GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND WC1H 9JR",0003-4967,,,ANN RHEUM DIS,Ann.

This result raises the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway may be involved in the regulation of cell-biomaterial interaction. To learn more about the interaction of anchorage-dependent cells with biomaterials, four different materials with wettability ranging from hydrophilic (water contact angle 25 degrees) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 111 degrees) were investigated, i.e. clean glass (glass), aminopropylsilane (APS), octadecylsilane (ODS) and silicone (SI). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed increased stress formation and fibronectin (FN) receptor-rich focal adhesions for fibroblasts attached on more hydrophilic surfaces (glass and APS) in comparison to the relatively hydrophobic materials (ODS and SI). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, also studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, was considerably higher on glass and APS, lower for ODS, negligible for SI, and was found to colocalize with FN receptor-rich focal adhesions. Preadsorption of FN tended to restore cell adhesion and spreading on the hydrophobic ODS and SI. Quantitative data on cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation showed moderate wettable material maximum values for APS, followed by glass, ODS and SI, demonstrating a non-linearity of these parameters with the wettability of materials. Interestingly, the preadsorption of FN increased both parameters, particularly for the hydrophobic materials ODS and SI. Phosphorylation of tyrosine on FN-coated substrata was corroborated by the accessibility of binding sites estimated by ELISA using polyclonal and monoclonal FN antibodies. Our results suggest that measurement of the phosphotyrosine activity of cells may be a sensitive parameter for the ability of biomaterials to support the attachment and proliferation of cells.

Design: Open study. Setting: Specialist clinic, USA. Subjects: 3480 Out of a total of 4000 men whose primary inguinal hernias were repaired between June 1984 and June 1995. Interventions: Hernia repair involving total reinforcement of the transversalis fascia with mesh. Main outcome measure: Morbidity, particularly recurrence. Results: A total of 1776 (44.4%) were direct hernias, 1724 (43.2%) indirect, and 500 (12.5%) a combination; 456 (11.4%) were sliding hernias. Patients were followed up for a mean of 5 1/2 years (range 1-11) and 520 were lost to follow-up, leaving 3480 (87.0%) for analysis. All patients followed up were examined by a physician. There were five recurrences (0.1%), four at the pubic tubercle and one in which the mesh had torn away from the inguinal ligament because it was too narrow. There has been one recurrence in the last six years of the study. One patient developed orchitis. There was one case of postoperative neuralgia. There were no seromas that required aspiration. Most patients had returned to work within two weeks, including the manual workers. Conclusion: Repair of primary inguinal hernias under local anaesthesia with the open, tension-free technique using polypropylene mesh results in acceptable morbidity, and appreciable reductions in postoperative discomfort, duration of hospital stay, recurrence rate and costs.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,HARBOR MED CTR,RES & EDUC INST,DEPT SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,CEDARS SINAI MED CTR,DEPT SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024","Amid, PK (reprint author), LICHTENSTEIN HERNIA INST,9201 SUNSET BLVD,SUITE 505,LOS ANGELES,CA 90069, USA.",,,,,,,39,184,191,0,5,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Correlations were made between the number of adherent bacterial cells (S, aureus) and each of the calculated components of surface free energy (ie., dispersion, polarity and hydrogen bond) of biomaterials. The effect of antibodies to cell-adhesion molecules on bacterial adhesion was also studied using monoclonal antibodies to vitronectin receptor fibronectin receptor and CD44. This study indicates the polarity component of surface free energy plays a dominant role in the process of bacterial adhesion at least in vitro. The number of cells adherent to materials decreased to 44-73% of the control value in the presence of antibodies tested showing that cell adhesion molecules affect adherence to biomaterials. Moreover, the results suggested that bacterial adhesion was prevented by specific blockade of cell adhesion molecule receptors.","OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT BACTERIOL,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN","Kitano, T (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ABENO KU,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,10,11,0,1,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Bovine periosteum-derived cells were cultivated in vitro, put onto bio-resorbable polymer fiber constructs, and allowed to grow until most of the fibers were coated with multiple layers of osteoblasts. Standardized 9-mm nonhealing defects were created in 24 male athymic rat femurs and bridged with titanium miniplates. In 12 animals, the defects were filled with polymer constructs containing periosteum-derived cells (experimental group); in another 12 animals, the defects were either left unfilled (control group I) or filled with polymer templates alone (control group II). After 12-week in vivo implantation, the new bone produced bridged the surgically created defects completely in seven of 10 cases. The animals of the control groups did not show significant bone formation in the gap. Histologic evaluation revealed bone formation in all experimental specimens with rests of cartilage islands showing hypertrophying chondrocytes indicative of enchondral bone formation. Tissue-engineered growth of bone resulted in healing of large segmental bone defects in an orthotopic site in an animal model. The findings of this study support potential applications of the technique of tissue-engineered growth of bone to clinical situations where local bone formation is needed.

We have compared five methods for the measurement of thickness: (1) a Mitutoyo non-rotating thickness gauge; (2) a custom-built, instrumented thickness gauge which was strain-gauged to measure contact force; (3) a commercial Hall effect probe (Panametrics Magna-Mike); (4) a custom-built electrical resistance probe; and (5) measurement of fresh frozen histological sections under polarized light. Using bovine pericardium as a test material, all the methods examined were adequate to assess sample-to-sample and location-to-location differences in thickness. The resistance gauge gave significantly greater thicknesses than did the other methods, with little or no compression; indeed, extrapolation to zero load of thickness readings from the instrumented gauge yielded identical thickness. Thicknesses measured by frozen sections were indistinguishable from those measured with the non-rotating gauge, the instrumented gauge under 0.5-1.2 g compressive load, or the Hall effect probe. With the correct technique, the simple and inexpensive non-relating gauge remains a pragmatic choice for thickness measurement in planar soft tissue.

Using a light curing resin as a matrix gave a significantly higher modulus for a filler loading of 38% by volume, Storage in water for 29 days was found to have only a slight effect on moduli for composite systems containing in excess of 20% by volume of filler, The experimental composite systems produced slightly higher values for moduli than were predicted by the theoretical Reuss constant stress model.

The fibroblasts were cultured on 50 nm Ti-coated silicon wafers treated with radio-frequency glow discharge prior to use and on Falcon tissue culture plastic (TCP) dishes as a control. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that fibroblasts cultured on Ti reduced the fibronectin mRNA level by 58% at 16 h, but increased it by 2.6-fold at 90 h, although the cell numbers and house-keeping gene GAPD mRNA levels on these two surfaces were essentially the same. The amount of total RNA was slightly less on the Ti surface. While the total [S-35]methionine incorporation was essentially unaltered, the amount of [S-35]methionine-labeled fibronectin was significantly increased in cells cultured on a Ti surface in early cultures but decreased in the late cultures. The apparent discrepancy between the increased fibronectin mRNA levels and decreased translation could be explained by a 30% reduction in fibronectin mRNA half life in cells cultured on Ti. The distribution of fibronectin between the medium and the cell layer also was altered on Ti surfaces, with a similar to 100-fold increase of fibronectin assembled in extracellular matrix at 16 h, but a 36% reduction at 90 h. In contrast, the amount of fibronectin recovered in the medium was essentially unchanged. The total amount of protein assembled into the extracellular matrix by cells on Ti increased 2.1-fold at 16 h but decreased by 19% in 90-h cultures. These significant changes in fibronectin gene activity and gene product distribution by cells cultured on Ti surfaces demonstrate that the surface chemistry of biomaterials can selectively regulate the cellular behavior at the molecular level and, conversely, that molecular biological techniques provide sensitive indicators of the molecular biocompatibility of implant materials.

Implants of polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polypropylene prostheses were introduced into the abdominal wall of New Zea la nd rabbits. The behaviour of the biomaterials was analysed using light and scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in which a specific anti-rabbit macrophage monoclonal antibody (RAM 11) was employed. According to macroscopic observation,there was significantly fewer adhesions prosthesis-viscera to ePTFE than to polypropylene implants. After ePTFE implantation, restoration of the peritoneum took place in an orderly fashion. When polypropylene was used, the peritoneum formed was a disorderly tissue in which small areas of haemorrhage and necrosis could be seen to coincide with the appearance of adhesions. The number of labelled macrophages peaked 14 days after ePTFE or polypropylene implantation, after wh ich it decreased gradually. It is concluded that, given the low rate of adhesion provoked by PTFE, this material is ideal for im-plants contiguous to the peritoneal cavity viscera. The macrophage response does not determine the use of one material or the other.

The role of blood proteins in the pathogenesis of implant infection has been investigated, but research into the role of CSF proteins in shunt infections has not been undertaken, even though a high CSF protein has been assumed to increase the risk of such infections. Methods-New shunt catheters were exposed to either CSF or individual protein solutions, and the numbers of radiolabelled staphylococci that adhered to them were compared with controls that had been exposed to saline only. Results-A significant reduction in bacteria adhering to the test catheter was found in each instance. Furthermore, the CSF with the highest protein content, from a patient with intraventricular haemorrhage, had the greatest inhibitory effect on bacterial adhesion. The effect of the solutions on the hydrophobicity of the silicone rubber was also investigated. The silicone rubber was more hydrophilic, and bacterial adhesion was less, with solutions containing a higher protein content, and these findings were in keeping with the current theories on the mechanism of bacterial adhesion to polymers. Conclusions-A high CSF protein content does not predispose to the development of shunt infections.","GREAT ORMOND ST HOSP CHILDREN, DEPT NEUROSURG, LONDON, ENGLAND; INST CHILD HLTH, DEPT ACAD MICROBIOL, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,50,15,15,0,2,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0022-3050,1468-330X,,J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS,J.

The use of the machine does not require a chart recorder but it can be linked to a personal computer, either to show force-displacement relationships or for data storage. The design allows the use of any relatively 'soft' mechanical test, i.e. tests in which the deformability of the frame of the machine and its load cell do not introduce significant errors into the results.

Segments of length 1.2 cm were interposed between the proximal and distal stumps of transected ischiatic nerves in Wistar rats, bridging a nerve gap of 1 cm. All of the procedure was performed under general anaesthesia using microsurgical techniques. Controls were performed at 1, 3 and 6 months and it was demonstrated that the conduit was still undamaged after 30 d. Progressive signs of degradation appeared at 90 and 180 d. Nerve regeneration in the lumen was effective as confirmed by histological and electron microscopical investigations. These preliminary results emphasize the interesting properties of the conduit with regard to the achievement of a neural prosthesis.","UNIV BOLOGNA,CATTEDRA FISIOPATOL CHIRURG,BOLOGNA,ITALY; IST RIC CODIVILLA PUTTI IOR,LAB BIOL CELLULARE & MICROSCOPIA ELETTRON,BOLOGNA,ITALY; NOVAMONT SPA,NOVARA,ITALY","Aldini, NN (reprint author), IST RIC CODIVILLA PUTTI IOR,SERV CHIRURG SPERIMENTALE,BOLOGNA,ITALY.",,,,,,,16,80,82,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,959,962,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84669-2,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600002,,,,,2019-02-25

The tissue reaction evoked by films of these new biomaterials implanted into the dorsolumbar musculature of rats was assessed quantitatively using a well established technique based upon an image analysis system. The number of inflammatory cells present and the patterns of cell distribution around the implant up to a distance of 642 mu m were examined at different time periods after implantation. Since a well-delineated tissue-material interface was needed for this type of investigation, it was not possible to apply image analysis to sections once dissolution of the implanted materials had begun. Films of both the total esters, HYAFF 7 and HYAFF 11, were found to undergo a slow dissolution process and, after a month, films of these materials were still present at the site of implantation. Differences in response to the two materials were observed only during the first two weeks, particularly with respect to neutrophil distribution and total cellularity. HYAFF 7 was found to be more reactive, with higher numbers of neutrophils near the surface of the implant than HYAFF 11. Thereafter, the differences between the two materials were minimal and owing mainly to a faster dissolution of HYAFF 7 films. After 3 and 5 months, considerable degradation of films of both total esters had occurred. Significant quantities of material appeared inside numerous macrophages with an ED1-positive phenotype. Only a very thin layer of fibrous connective tissue, indicative of low reactivity, was found to surround the site of implantation, separating the dissolved material and the phagocytic cells from healthy muscular tissue. ED2-positive macrophages were primarily confined within the lining connective tissue. The partial benzyl ester, HYAFF 11p75, showed a different behaviour. In fact, evidence of film dissolution was already present a week after the implantation. After two weeks, the implanted films were completely dissolved and numerous ED1-positive macrophages phagocytosing the material were observed at the site of implantation. Therefore, in agreement with previous in vitro studies, which showed a greater susceptibility to degradation of hyaluronan derivatives with lower percentage of esterification, HYAFF 11p75 underwent resorption faster than the corresponding total ester.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND; FIDIA ADV BIOPOLYMERS SRL,I-35031 ABANO TERME,PADUA,ITALY",,,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012; Campoccia, Davide/K-5348-2018","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778; Campoccia, Davide/0000-0002-3336-0219",,,,16,55,56,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,963,975,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84670-9,,,,13,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600003,8736730.0,,,,2019-02-25

The surface-bound complement factors were detected by ellipsometry-antibody techniques. The overall complement activation was subsequently corroborated independently with enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and sheep and chicken erythrocyte haemolytic complement techniques. EIA experiments indicated elevated levels of C4d, but no significant increase of factor Bb was evident in the test serum from the MG system. The haemolytic assays show that MG surfaces consume complement factors from both pathways. Ellipsometry revealed that immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement factor 1q (C1q) are transiently antibody detectable on MG after exposure to whole serum by the use of antibody techniques. Complement factor 3 (C3), C2, C4 and properdin could be detected on the surface, but not factors H and B. The total adsorbed mass and particularly C3 antibody deposition were suppressed by using EGTA-Mg2+ serum. The results suggest that MG surfaces initially activate complement via the classical pathway.

This study examines the activation of leucocytes on a series of well-characterized polyurethanes with different ionic groups [sulphonate groups (negatively charged); quaterinary amine groups (positively charged)], in terms of adhesion, degranulation and cell surface integrin receptor expression. Leucocyte adhesion was monitored with radiolabelled neutrophils and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), degranulation by measurement of human neutrophil elastase: using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell surface expression of the integrin receptor Mac-1, using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FAGS). Our results indicate a trend towards enhanced adhesion and degranulation with respect to the negatively charged polyurethane. Similar results were observed with respect to the integrin Mac-1 from recovered adherent cells. The findings of enhanced adhesion and spreading, Mac-1 up-regulation and granulocyte elastase release from the negatively charged sulphonated polyurethane indicate the potential of leucocytes to contribute towards thrombus formation on such surfaces.","UNIV DELAWARE,DEPT CHEM ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; TEMPLE UNIV,SCH MED,SOL SHERRY THROMBOSIS RES CTR,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19140",,,,,,,,27,25,25,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,1041,1047,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84681-3,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600014,8736741.0,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of degree of lipid hydration, phospholipid chemical structure, mesophase identity, aqueous medium composition, and incident flux on the severity and progress of damage was quantified using time-resolved x-ray diffraction and chromatographic analysis of damage products. Electron spin resonance measurements of spin-trapped intermediates generated during irradiation suggest a free radical-mediated process. Surprisingly, radiation damage effects revealed by x-ray diffraction were imperceptible when the lamellar phases were prepared under water-stressed conditions, despite the fact that x-ray-induced chemical breakdown of the lipid occurred regardless of hydration level, Of the fully hydrated lipid systems studied, saturated diacyl-phosphatidylcholines were most sensitive to radiation damage compared to the ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines and the ether-linked phosphatidylcholines. The inclusion of buffers or inorganic salts in the dispersing medium had only a minor effect in reducing damage development. A small inverse dose-rate effect was found when the x-ray beam intensity was changed 15-fold. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of radiation damage, to our appreciation of the importance of monitoring both structure and composition when evaluating biomaterials radiation sensitivity, and to the development of strategies for eliminating or reducing the severity of damage due to an increasingly important source of x rays, synchrotron radiation. Because damage is shown to be free radical mediated, these results have an important bearing on age-related accumulation of free radicals in cells and how these might compromise membrane integrity, culminating in cell death.","OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,COLUMBUS,OH 43210",,,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-014646]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK36849, DK46295]",,,31,37,43,1,6,BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

A structure-bonding model of these materials is based upon Ca2+-crown ether-like coordination to the decaethylene glycol head group of one or two of the surfactant molecules. Ca2+ binding of two surfactant head groups, makes possible cis- and trans-conformations for the alkyl tails, resulting in normal and inverted structures with preferences for hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The extent of Ca2+ ion clustering in the head group determines the geometrical packing requirements of the surfactant and the overall dimensions of the resulting lamellar liquid-crystal phases.

The present study was carried out to assess the expression of IL-1 Methods. Interface tissue between the implant and bone was obtained fr om hip revision operations and was compared to healthy joint capsular tissue. Membrane bound IL-1 alpha was stained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method nod was quantified using morphometry (VIDAS image analysis system). Soluble IL-1 beta was measured by ELISA. IL-1 levels were compared to collagenase activities in the same tissue as assessed by the degradation of triple helical type I collagen monomers analyzed by SDS-PAGE/laser densitometry. Results. The IL-1 alpha staining index was high in interface tissue (7.25 +/- 1.28, p < 0.01) compared to normal joint capsular tissue (0.50 +/- 0.04). Similarly, IL-1 beta levels (ng/ml; ELISA) were high in such tissue (139.0 +/- 71.9 vs 0 +/- 0, p < 0.02). Total collagenase was higher in the interface (26.3 x 10(-6) +/- 7.57 x 10(-6) IU/l, p < 0.01) than in control tissue (0.55 x 10(-6) +/- 0.44 x 10(-6) IU/l). IL-1 alpha (r = -0.04, p > 0.05) and IL-1 beta (r = 0.25, p > 0.05) did not correlate with collagenase activity in interface tissue. Conclusion. Both IL-1 (alpha and beta) and collagenase are up-regulated around loose THR, suggesting that they may play a role in loosening. However, the correlations between IL-1 and collagenase were not significant, indicating, that IL-1 is probably not the only cytokine involved in the regulation of collagenase activity in vivo. IL-1 may also contribute to loosening by its osteoclast activating properties.","INVALID FDN, ORTON ORTHOPED HOSP, HELSINKI, FINLAND; HELSINKI UNIV, CENT HOSP, DEPT MED, HELSINKI, FINLAND; YAMAGATA UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, YAMAGATA 99023, JAPAN; TOOLO HOSP, DEPT ORTHOPED & TRAUMATOL, HELSINKI, FINLAND; UNIV OSLO, NATL HOSP, INST SURG RES, OSLO, NORWAY","Konttinen, YT (reprint author), HELSINKI UNIV, INST BIOMED, DEPT ANAT, POB 9, SILTAVUORENPENGER 20A, FIN-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,34,26,26,1,2,CLINICAL & EXPER RHEUMATOLOGY,PISA,"VIA SANTA MARIA 31, 56126 PISA, ITALY",0392-856X,,,CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL,Clin.

Many of these infections arise from an endogenous source, and their frequency is influenced by the patient population, the various treatment regimens, and the antibiotics or other supportive care measures employed at specific institutions.

In vitro ii biocompatibility tests were developed to simulate and predict biological reactions to materials when placed into or on tissues in the body. Traditional assays have measured cytotoxicity by means of either an end-stage event, (i.e., permeability of cytoplasmic membranes of dead and dying cells, or some metabolic parameter such as cell division or an enzymatic reaction). In vitro assays for initiation of inflammatory and immune reactions to materials have also begun to appear in the literature. More recently, the concept of dentin barrier tests has been introduced for dental restorative materials. Four models which measure both permeability and biological effects of materials are compared and discussed. Future efforts may be directed toward development of materials which will allow or promote function and differentiation of tissues associated with materials. New analytical procedures and understanding of optimal characteristics of materials should improve our ability to develop more biocompatible materials. Both molecular biology techniques, and altered design of material surfaces may make the materials either more or less reactive to the biological milieu. These trends suggest a greater future role of the biological sciences in the development of biomaterials.","MED COLL GEORGIA, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL REHABIL, AUGUSTA, GA 30912 USA","Hanks, CT (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH DENT 5223, DEPT ORAL MED PATHOL & SURG, 1011 N UNIV AVE, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09296],,,100,166,169,2,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

In this study, the passive oxide film formed on titanium and its natural growth in a phosphate buffered solution with and without an H2O2 addition have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements over a period of several weeks. In the absence of H2O2, the impedance response indicated a stable thin oxide film on titanium. However, the introduction of H2O2 into the solution resulted in significant changes in the EIS-spectra, which varied with exposure time. The interpretation of results is based upon a two-layer model of the oxide film, consisting of a thin barrier-type inner layer and a porous outer layer. The H2O2 addition in the solution led to a significant decrease in corrosion resistance of titanium and also to a thickening of the porous outer layer. The observations may provide an explanation of the unexpected in vivo titanium oxide growth and ion incorporation into titanium implant oxide surfaces.","SWEDISH CORROS INST,S-10405 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","Pan, J (reprint author), ROYAL INST TECHNOL,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,DR KRISTINAS VAG 51,S-10044 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,36,397,407,6,118,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0013-4686,,,ELECTROCHIM ACTA,Electrochim.

After adhering to biomaterial surfaces, other leukocyte reactions, such as phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and protease release, may occur and result in the deterioration of the implanted biomaterial and injury to peripheral tissue. This study of neutrophil adhesion quantitatively characterizes neutrophil adhesion under well-defined laminar flow conditions using a radial flow chamber. In this theologically well-defined system, the fluid shear rate on the surface varies continuously with radial position. This allows the study of shear-dependent behavior of neutrophil adhesion. Exploiting the variable shear rate in the radial flow chamber, the kinetics of neutrophil adhesion was obtained using automated video microscopy and image analysis to recursively acquire cell counts from multiple fields in different radial positions, and to quantify the surface density of neutrophil as a function of time. Neutrophil adhesion was studied on glass preadsorbed with fibrinogen and high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). At a shear rate of 20 s(-1), the number of adherent cells on the preadsorbed fibrinogen surface was similar to that on ban glass, and the number of adherent cells on the HK surface was less than 10% of that on the bare glass. We conclude that surfaces preadsorbed with HK are anti-adhesive to neutrophils.","TEMPLE UNIV,SCH MED,SOL SHERRY THROMBOSIS RES CTR,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19140","Yung, LYL (reprint author), UNIV DELAWARE,DEPT CHEM ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716, USA.",,"Yung, Lanry/B-6515-2009","Yung, Lanry/0000-0001-7579-6347","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-45486, HL-47179]",,,17,20,20,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0162-3109,,,IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY,Immunopharmacology,MAY,1996.0,32,1-3,,,,,19,23,,10.1016/0162-3109(96)00003-3,,,,5,Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,UR643,WOS:A1996UR64300006,8796260.0,,,,2019-02-25

Reconstituted type I collagen as well as sheet collagen were crosslinked in the presence of alkaline phosphatase and egg-yolk phosvitin. The crosslinked collagens were immersed in daily-renewed calcium beta-glycerophosphate solutions for 2 and 4 weeks to induce the deposition of apatite on the collagen fibers. After 2 weeks of reaction, for example, apatites deposited approximately two times the crosslinked collagen in weight. With reconstituted collagen, the complex showed some elasticity but no apatite was visually observed to detach under deformation with fingers and forceps. The complex, moreover, did not disintegrate when immersed in saline or animal blood. Nevertheless, the complex resorbed with no evidence of cytotoxity when implanted in muscle tissues. These findings suggest that the apatite-collagen complex prepared would be useful as bone substitutes, especially for periodontal osseous lesion repair and alveolar ridge augmentation.

To study the haptenic potential of these metal ions, rabbit albumin-glutathione-metal complexes with chromium, cobalt, or nickel were injected into mice. The splenocytes from one mouse in each group which developed a strong antibody against GSH-metal complexes were isolated and fused with myeloma cells to produce monoclonal antibodies. Chromium, cobalt, and nickel antibodies had similar affinity and bound with the specific GSH-metal complex. There was very little cross-reactivity between these antibodies. An inhibition assay using these monoclonal antibodies was demonstrated to be a simple technique, suitable for quantitation of free metal in solution.

Cell adhesion and proliferation on the sur faces of the polymer discs were observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. During the first 24 hours of attachment, the cells showed normal morphology when cultured on copolymers containing 1,6-bis(carboxyphenoxy)hexane. The cells did not adhere to the polymers containing sebacic acid, probably due to the rapid degradation of the polymer surfaces. Concurrently, the effects of polymer breakdown products on osteoblast-like cells were evaluated by studying their proliferation (cell numbers), viability (dye exclusion), morphology (light microscopy), and phenotypic expression. The morphology of osteoblast-like cells cultured in the presence of the polymer breakdown products pyromellitylimidoalanine and pyromellitic acid was found to be similar to that of the same cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene and consisted of a characteristic polygonal shape. With use of a monoclonal antibody to osteocalcin, these cells were shown to demonstrate preserved osteoblast phenotype with growth over a 21-day period.

In blood the adhesion and activation of platelets and leucocytes were studied by fluorescence microscopy using specific FITC-labeled antibodies or acridine orange. Intraperitoneal leucocyte adhesion was studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission microscopy, or by staining with acridine orange. The metallic surfaces were exposed to both blood and peritoneal fluid for times varying from 15 s to 4 h. The results show (a) that a significantly larger number of platelets followed by a correspondingly large number of leucocytes initially adhere to Ti rather than to Au, (b) that the rate of the inflammatory response as manifested by the appearance of leucocytes is more rapid in the peritoneal cavity than in blood, and (c) that cells attach directly to the Au surfaces while being separated by an amorphous layer on the Ti surfaces.

NR of HSA adsorbed from D2O buffer onto NH3+ terminated SAM surfaces revealed a two-layer adsorption regime. The first layer directly adjacent to the solid surface was about 40 Angstrom thick and was essentially independent of bulk liquid concentration whereas the second layer was more strongly dependent on liquid phase concentration studied, extending an additional 40 Angstrom into solution at the maximum solution concentration (0.1% wt/V). NR results are thus consistent with multilayer or mixed-layer protein adsorption mechanism and formation of an interphase region about 80 Angstrom in thickness that separates bulk solid and bulk liquid phases. By contrast, no such interphase could be resolved for an HSA solution in contact with a water-wettable SiOx surface, suggesting that HSA does not adsorb to fully-water-wettable surfaces from water. Implications of these results in biomaterials science, especially blood contact phenomena, are briefly discussed in the summary.","NIST,DIV REACTOR RADIAT,GAITHERSBURG,MD 20899; UNIV AKRON,INST POLYMER SCI,AKRON,OH 44325; BECTON DICKINSON RES CTR,POLYMER SCI & TECHNOL DEPT,RES TRIANGLE PK,NC 27709",,,,,,,,37,58,59,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,1996.0,12,9,,,,,2256,2262,,10.1021/la950642d,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,UJ056,WOS:A1996UJ05600022,,,,,2019-02-25

This will lead to a clinical infection only if several factors favour the bacterial adhesion or the bacterial coaggregation and the feeding of the bacterial biofilm, Among the many factors involved in bacterial adhesion, we focused in this paper on the physical parameters of surface hydrophobicity of the urinary catheters (Van der Waals and acido-basic forces) and the surface hydrophobicity of the bacteria (BATH and zeta potential). We also compared scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of in vivo and in vitro infected urinary catheters, We provided evidence that the more hydrophobic the bacteria, the more they are able to colonize hydrophobic materials, whereas hydrophilic cells are able to colonize hydrophilic materials more easily. Some biomaterials were found to display an irregular texture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas : they favour both types of adhesion, Moreover the divalent cations (MgII) drastically increased the bacterial coaggregation and favour bacterial growth within the biofilm. Finally, an increase in urinary pH and ionic strength increases the colonization risk. Consequently, choice of urinary catheter biomaterial is essential as patient hygiene and diet in order to avoid clinical infections.","CHRU,HOP ROBERT DEBRE,MICROBIOL LAB,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE; UFR PHARM,MICROBIOL LAB,F-51096 REIMS,FRANCE; CHRU,HOP ROBERT DEBRE,CHIRURG GEN & DIGEST,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE","Brisset, L (reprint author), UFR ODONTOL,2 RUE GEN KOENIG,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE.",,"Vernet-Garnier, Veronique/P-5729-2016",,,,,25,13,13,0,4,EXPANSION SCI FRANCAISE,PARIS,"31 BLVD LATOUR MAUBOURG, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0369-8114,,,PATHOL BIOL,Pathol.

Three types of HEMA gels were synthesized: neutral (HEMA), acidic (HEMA + acrylic acid), and basic (HEMA + dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate). Each gel was synthesized at four initial volume fractions to obtain different equilibrium swelling ratios and microstructures. Sorption as a function of time was measured for each gel at pH 7, 7.5, and 8. The rate of uptake by the acidic gels was more rapid than that by the neutral gels: To sorb 90% of the protein required only 1 h for the acidic gels but 15 days for neutral gels. Lysozyme did not adsorb or partition into the basic gels. The fractional approach to equilibrium was most rapid for the more swollen gels, and the effect of pH was small. The results reported here may be useful for rational design of new biomaterials where it is desirable to know the relative magnitude of the effects of composition, synthesis, and pH on protein sorption.

The results show that with a wavelength of 355 nm better results could be obtained with most of the matrices. The molecular weight of cytochrome c, which was separated by gel electrophoresis and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The accuracy was better than 0.1%, which is much higher than that of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The three components of protein mixture extracted from crude peanut oil was directly determined by MALDI-MS. The result also demonstrated that these proteins are in a free manner. Since these proteins are in a 2S bond, with the traditional method, SDS-PAGE, it is not possible to decide whether the proteins exist in a combination mode or in a free manner. Water-soluble polymers stained with dyes are used in the technique of two-phase aqueous solution, which is used for separating biomaterials.

Cross-linking using EDC involves the activation of carboxylic acid groups to give O-acylisourea groups, which form cross-links after reaction with free amine groups. Treatment of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with EDC (E-DSC) resulted in materials with an increased shrinkage temperature (T-s) and a decreased free amine group content, showing that cross-linking occurred. Addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide to the EDC-containing cross-linking solution (E/N-DSC) increased the rate of cross-linking. Cross-linking increased the T-s of non-cross-linked DSC samples from 56 to 73 degrees C for E-DSC and to 86 degrees C for E/N-DSC samples, respectively. For both cross-linking methods a linear relation between the decrease in free amine group content and the increase in T-s was observed. The tensile strength and the high strain modulus of E/N-DSC samples decreased upon cross-linking from 18 to 15 MPa and from 26 to 16 MPa, respectively.

Ch6SO(4) incorporated into collagen gels stimulated cell growth rate, but the effect was found to be inconsistent. We found that approximately 50% of the incorporated Ch6SO(4) in the gels leached out into the growth medium after the first 3 d in culture, and this is thought to lead to the inconsistent cell growth response. In order to minimize the elution of Ch6SO(4) from the gels and thereby maximize its effect on the growth of the keratinocytes, 1-100 mu g ml(-1) Ch6SO(4) was added in the medium. The results showed that Ch6SO(4) at these concentrations in the medium did not stimulate the cell growth on either plain collagen gels or gels containing 20% Ch6SO(4). As an alternative strategy, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and diamines (putrescine or diaminohexane) were used to immobilize Ch6SO(4) onto the collagen gels and to cross-link the gels. The cross-linking process partially prevented the elution of Ch6SO(4) from the gels. Interestingly, only putrescine, not diaminohexane, promoted the growth of keratinocytes on the cross-linked plain collagen gels. We proposed to develop an artificial skin substitute containing putrescine as a growth factor for the human epidermal cells.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; GLASGOW ROYAL INFIRM,BURNS UNIT,GLASGOW,LANARK,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,35,49,49,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,APR,1996.0,17,8,,,,,775,780,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)81414-1,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UE609,WOS:A1996UE60900004,8730961.0,,,,2019-02-25

The specimens were exposed for 7 and 28 days at 37 degrees C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. One set of experiments was carried out at 60 degrees C to determine the effect of temperature on the film stability. Environmental exposure had little direct effect on the film properties, but the fluids tended to degrade the interfacial adhesion when penetration to the interface was possible. This can occur via microscopic penetrations in the film or via the edges. The buffered saline solution appeared to be the most aggressive in this respect.

Our previous studies showed functional differentiated cells and collagen synthesis in the pore of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene implant. This study identifies and quantifies collagen types synthesized in the implant. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene polymers were implanted in the rabbit corneas. The collagen extracted from the polymer and implanted stroma after 1, 3 and 6 months was quantified by measuring hydroxyproline. The relative proportions of collagen types were determined by densitometric analysis after SDS-PAGE. The collagen-to-protein ratio in the polymer increased from 0.22 to 0.70 between the first and third month after implantation becoming similar to control cornea. So that of the protein and collagen densities in the polymer and implanted stroma were similar to the control from the third month. The collagen synthesized in the polymer was mainly type I (87%) plus a small amount of type III (8%) 1 month after implantation. The collagen distribution from the third month after implantation was similar to that of the controls and remained constant thereafter in the polymer implant and in the implanted stroma. Immunogold labelling techniques confirmed these results. Implantation of this PTFE disc induced no obvious modification of the corneal stroma, confirming that this polymer is a good interface that is compatible with the native corneal stroma. The keratocytes in this polymer rapidly adopted a corneal phenotype, distinct from the dermal or scaring phenotype as shown by the collagen types produced in the implant.

Before the advent of modern hemorheology in the 70s, studies were mainly focussed on microcirculation and validation of global hemorheological equations applied to blood circulation. Parallel studies on the microrheological properties (erythrocyte deformability and aggregation) explained analytically the non-Newtonian behavior of blood, and the essential contribution of these parameters to the understanding hyperviscosity syndromes. The development of clinical hemorheology in fact started at the international conferences held in Reykjavik (1966) and Heidelberg (1969), and with the initiation of the periodical European Microcirculation (since Nancy in 1960) and Clinical Hemorheology (since Nancy in 1979) Conferences. The current main avenues of research involve flow modelling, studies of cell-cell interaction mechanisms (aggregation and adhesion), in relation to the associated pathophysiological phenomena, such as cellular activation (platelets and leukocytes in particular), gene expression linked to blood flow (e.g. endothelial cells)... Clinically and therapeutically, it is crucial that pathophysiological studies be undertaken on the relationship existing between theological parameters and objective clinical data (local flow rates, ischemic markers, hemostatic parameters, tissue oxygen, clinical symptoms,...). The main clinical application fields are cardiovascular diseases, thrombosis, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia... Also, studies on new therapeutics or on biomaterials should also be given priority (J Mal Vasc 1996; 21 : pages 7-15).",,"Stoltz, JF (reprint author), FAC MED,DEPT HEMATOL EA1728,PLATEAU BRABOIS,F-54500 VANDOEUVRE NANCY,FRANCE.",,,,,,,138,3,3,0,2,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0398-0499,,,J MAL VASCUL,J.

This process is generally amplified in pathologic states as atherosclerosis. Atheroma originates from smooth muscle cells (SMC) which have migrated and proliferated in the vascular intima. In this study we investigated protein synthesis, collagen synthesis, and types I, Ill, and V collagen distribution by SMC in the presence of three families of water-soluble polysaccharides, heparin, fucans, and derivatized dextrans. We observed that fucan and derivatized dextran were able, as was heparin, to inhibit rat aortic SMC growth in culture. We then analyzed collagen modulation by measuring the incorporation of the radiolabeled precursor (H-3)-proline into vascular SMC. Our results showed uncoupling of the antiproliferative capacity with collagen biosynthesis. However, fucan, the most antiproliferative polysaccharide, was also the most active in inhibiting protein and collagen synthesis. In addition, compounds that decreased total collagen synthesis preferentially increased the proportion of cell-associated collagen. Interestingly, only the antiproliferative polysaccharides inhibited significantly type V collagen biosynthesis. These new biomaterials appear to be valuable tools to study and control extracellular-matrix interactions with cells from the vascular walls.

The method, termed GESFIDE (gradient-echo sampling of FID and echo) is based on sampling the descending and ascending portions of a Hahn echo with a train of gradient echoes. R(2) and R(2)' are computed by exploiting the differential evolution of the transverse magnetization before and after the phase-reversal pulse. Salient features of the method are its insensitivity to RF pulse imperfections and its high precision and efficiency.

The rate of their biodegradation can be reduced by treating them with different cross-linking agents. The efficiency of different reticulation procedures on thermal stability (measured by differential scanning calorimetry) and susceptibility to bacterial collagenase digestion of the final material (films or sponges) is compared. The chemical agents used on collagen gels or directly on collagen sponges and films were glutaraldehyde (GTA), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDC), cya nam ide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and the two acyl azide methods (with hydrazine or diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA)) developed in the authors' laboratory. Under these experimental conditions, collagen stabilization by the different agents increased in the following order: cyanamide < EDC < HMDC < hydrazine < DPPA < GTA. Sponges with the highest thermal stability were obtained by treating collagen gel with 0.5% GTA for 1 h at pH 5.5 (initial T-d = 75.8 degrees C; after 3 months, T-d = 75.6 degrees C). Direct treatment of collagen films with DPPA gave similar thermal stability (T-d = 72.6 degrees C) and collagenase resistance when compared with treatment with 0.6% GTA for 96 h (T-d = 74.6 degrees C). It is demonstrated that collagen sponges and films can be prepared with a wide range of thermal stability (49-75.8 degrees C) and collagenase digestion resistance (10-100%). Recent biocompatibility studies show, however, that DPPA and EDC are the best choices for preparing cross-linked collagen sponges and films.","INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS UPR 412,F-69367 LYON 7,FRANCE; COLET,LYON,FRANCE",,,,,,,,25,164,171,0,35,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

A deprotonation of the amine groups of adsorbed peptides was also observed, revealing a possibly chemical interaction with the mineral surface. Simultaneously a decrease of the Ca/P ratio of the mineral surface occurred.

Providing a comprehensive characterization of polymer blend surfaces requires a multi-instrumental approach, as no individual surface analysis technique can ascertain both the chemical and morphological nature of surfaces. In this study we have characterized the surfaces of immiscible and miscible blends of the biodegradable polymers poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA) using the surface techniques of static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SSIMS and XPS have recorded the surface enrichment of all of the blends with the PLA component. For the immiscible blends, differential charging within the XPS spectra also provides evidence of phase separation. AFM data have contrasted the surface morphologies of the immiscible and miscible blends, and the use of in situ AFM techniques has enabled the effect of blend morphology on surface erosion to be visualized. For the immiscible systems, clear phase separation morphologies can be observed and at certain blend compositions the rapid loss of the PSA from the films results in the exposure of the PLA morphology. However, as the PLA content is increased, the surface enrichment effect results in the degradation behavior of the blend being dominated by the slow degrading PLA surface layer. For the miscible systems, the in situ AFM studies visualized a disintegration of the whole blend film without the exposure of a PLA morphology, indicating that the hydrolysis of the PSA component rendered the whole film unstable. The use of SIMS, XPS, and AFM, while highlighting the complexity of polymer blend surfaces, can provide a rapid analysis of the physicochemical phenomena underlying the organization of these systems and therefore should facilitate the application of such systems as biomaterials.",,"Davies, MC (reprint author), UNIV NOTTINGHAM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,LAB BIOPHYS & SURFACE ANAL,UNIV PK,NOTTINGHAM NG7 2RD,ENGLAND.",,"Shard, Alexander/B-4530-2010; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009; Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009","Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596; Shard, Alexander/0000-0002-8931-5740; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439",,,,44,79,80,0,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,MAR 11,1996.0,29,6,,,,,2205,2212,,10.1021/ma950889h,,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,UA294,WOS:A1996UA29400049,,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of chemical treatment with amino acids is assessed in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats. Pericardial tissue from young calves was treated with L-lysine, L-glutamine, L-arginine or L-glutamic acid, each at a concentration of 0.5 M, following treatment with 0.625% glutaraldehyde. Then, the tissue was implanted into young rats for periods of 21 and 60 d, after which the calcium accumulated was quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Values similar to or higher than those found in control samples indicated a lack of effectiveness of these treatments. Only in the 21-d implantation samples treated with L-lysine and L-arginine was less calcium accumulated than in the control tissue. After 60 d of implantation, all groups showed high levels of calcium deposition. The values obtained after 60 d of subcutaneous implantation were 87.5 +/- 52.4 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-lysine, 108.7 +/- 43.5 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-glutamine, 130.4 +/- 22.4 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-glutamic acid, 119.3 +/- 27.6 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-arginine and 100.0 +/- 38.3 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for the control group.

The intraabdominal pressure is mainly influenced by the activity of the transverse muscles. The abdominal fascia of corpses withstands forces of 60-80 N/cm in horizontal and 20-30 N/cm in vertical direction; tearing of sutures occurs below 30 N/cm in horizontal direction. Assuming the abdominal cavity to be a thin hollow sphere, the rupture forces are approximatly 4-16 N/cm for a diameter of 8-32 cm. The meshes currently in use are much stronger than this, rupturing at 40-100 N/cm. The curvature of the abdominal surface can be measured by 3D-photogrammetry and is highly significantly reduced following mesh implantation (t-test, 2-sided, P < 0.01). Reduction of the mesh material can decrease the rate of local wound complications and the stiffness of the abdominal wall.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,AERODYNAM INST,W-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY; MED STATE UNIV,RES CTR,MOSCOW,RUSSIA","Klinge, U (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,CHIRURG KLIN,PAUWELSSTR 30,D-52057 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,"Oettinger, Alexander/G-8594-2014","Oettinger, Alexander/0000-0001-9894-0671",,,,12,78,83,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0009-4722,,,CHIRURG,Chirurg,MAR,1996.0,67,3,,,,,229,233,,,,,,5,Surgery,Surgery,UD763,WOS:A1996UD76300004,8681695.0,,,,2019-02-25

Thin sheets (250 mu m) of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene were cut into pieces measuring either 2x2, 2x4, 2x8, or 4x8 mm. The pieces were sterilized and placed individually within surgically prepared pockets in the sclera of rabbit eyes. Animals were sacrificed for routine histopathologic evaluation and transmission electron microscopic study of the eyes at 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, and 4 months following surgical implantation. The implants demonstrated excellent compatibility with the sclera and, by 14 days following implantation surgery, exhibited histiocytes, fibroblasts, and blood vessels infiltrating the internodal spaces of the highly porous material. The number of cells and the amount of extracellular matrix material deposited in the implants appeared to increase with time. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed deposition of collagen within the implants. Our results suggest that expanded polytetrafluoroethylene has potential for use in the development of a sclera-attached prosthetic device.","UNIV SO CALIF, SCH MED, DEPT OPHTHALMOL, LOS ANGELES, CA 90033 USA",,,,,NEI NIH HHS [EY03040],,,30,7,9,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0277-3740,1536-4798,,CORNEA,Cornea,MAR,1996.0,15,2,,,,,210,214,,10.1097/00003226-199603000-00016,,,,5,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,TW399,WOS:A1996TW39900016,8925671.0,,,,2019-02-25

In this study, human keratinocytes were cultured on the surface of collagen sponges, and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to assess both the microstructure of the sponge, and the cell morphology and distribution throughout the sponge. It was found that the pore size increased with increasing depth into the sponge. Both pore size and fiber thickness increased during incubation for up to 10 days at 37 degrees C in culture medium in the absence of cells. This latter effect was not observed when the sponges were incubated in distilled water. Keratinocytes penetrated into the sponge even after only 3 days in culture. By 10 days in culture, the cells had penetrated to the maximum depth that could be examined (120 mu m from the sponge surface). In the presence of cells, the inner structure of the collagen sponge had altered after 10 days in culture, with the collagen fibers becoming thicker, and pore geometry less regular. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown at present. Although the presence of the keratinocytes increases distortion of the sponge structure, factors from the medium itself also contribute to this effect. CLSM is a powerful tool for assessing cellular interactions with bioimplants, providing both qualitative and quantitative information. It offers many advantages over scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological techniques. CLSM minimizes the time-consuming, extensive preparation of samples required with the latter two methods, and allows noninvasive serial optical sectioning of intact samples.

We previously developed a biocompatible dermal sheep collagen (DSC), which in an abdominal wall reconstruction model showed controlled biodegradation and functioned as a matrix for ingrowth of fibroblasts but not of muscle. It was hypothesized that regeneration of muscle via DSC may be possible by seeding of muscle cells. Using a syringe, mouse C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in DSC disks and incubated in methylcellulose-based growth medium, changed at 24 h into differentiation medium. An estimated 85% of the cells were well distributed, especially in the top half of the DSC disks. Some 15% of the cells ended up on top. At 4 h, all cells showed a spherical morphology, sometimes with clear adhesion plaques. At 24 h, cells on the top started to form a ''capsule'' with well-spread cells. Underneath the capsule, of the remaining 85% of the cells, approximately 30% showed adhesion and spreading on/in between collagen bundles. At day 3 after the addition of differentiation medium, the spread cells showed first indications of myotube formation. At day 7, myotube formation had proceeded, while extracellular matrix, i.e., collagen and elastin, had been deposited. This study shows that myoblast seeding into DSC is feasible, resulting in a reasonable cell distribution and survival of 45% of the cells. The surviving cells are able to differentiate into myotubes and form an extracellular matrix.

Bacteria washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) adhered to polymers in amounts nearly twice those of bacteria that were left in their growth medium, tryptic soy broth (TSB). In TSB, there was variation in adhesion from species to species, but no significant variation from polymer to polymer within one species. In PBS there were significant differences in the amounts of bacteria adhering to the various polymers with the exception of S. epidermidis, which had similar adhesion to all polymers. As a whole, P. aeruginosa was the most adherent while S. epidermidis was the least adherent. The estimated values of the free energy of adhesion (Delta F-adh) correlated with the amount of adherent P. aeruginosa. When POE, PLA, and PSF were exposed to hyaluronic acid (HA) before exposure to the bacteria, there was 50% more adhesion of E. coli and P. aeruginosa on POE and PLA.

Because implant surfaces spontaneously adsorb host proteins, this proteinaceous film is probably important in the subsequent attraction of phagocytes. In fact, earlier we found that acute inflammatory responses to experimental polyethylene terephthalate implants in mice require the precedent adsorption of one particular host protein, fibrinogen. The present investigations were aimed at defining the molecular determinants of fibrinogen-mediated acute inflammatory responses to implanted biomaterials. We find: (a) plasmin degradation of purified fibrinogen into defined domains reveals that the proinflammatory activity resides within the D fragment, which contains neither the fibrin cross-linking sites nor RGD sequences; (b) the major (and, perhaps, exclusive) proinflammatory sequence appears to be fibrinogen gamma 190-202, previously shown to interact with CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1). The chemically synthesized peptide, cross-linked to albumin (which itself does not promote inflammatory responses), mimics the proinflammatory effect of adsorbed native fibrinogen; and (c) this sequence probably promotes inflammatory responses through interactions with Mac-1 because phagocyte accumulation on experimental implants is almost completely abrogated by administration of recombinant neutrophil inhibitory factor (which blocks CD11b-fibrin(ogen) interaction). We conclude that improved knowledge of such surface-protein-phagocyte interactions may permit the future development of more biocompatible implantable materials.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EMERGENCY PATHOL A 81, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA; CLEVELAND CLIN FDN, CTR THROMBOSIS & VASC BIOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44195 USA",,,,,,,,53,160,161,0,22,AMER SOC CLINICAL INVESTIGATION INC,ANN ARBOR,"2015 MANCHESTER RD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48104 USA",0021-9738,1558-8238,,J CLIN INVEST,J.

The specimens were analyzed two and four weeks later for their calcium content. Results: Over time untreated GBP and GlyBP calcified in vitro and in vivo while GPV retained low calcium levels in vivo. Surface seeding with rat fibrocytes significantly reduced the calcium accumulation in GBP and GlyBP in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05).

Defects that cannot be satisfactorily treated by complicated and costly reconstructive techniques reveal a need for an alloplastic tracheal replacement. Recent experimental and clinical studies in the development of alloplastic tracheal prostheses proved that the lack of an epithelial lining on the luminal surfaces and inadequate biophysical properties and shapes of the prostheses were the main causes for failure of these prostheses. In this study a cell-seeding technique has been used. Adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of seeded mucosa cells on biomaterials in vitro were observed by scanning election microscopy (SEM). Chemical properties and surface structure of the material influenced the differentiation process. Epithelium formation of incorporated tracheal prostheses was tested in animal experiments. Isolated respiratory cells were seeded into implanted tubular prostheses of porous polyurethane or expanded polytetrafluorethylene. Light microscopy and SEM showed the tendency of epithelium formation on the surface of the lumen. Vigorous cell layers, predominantly as multiple cell layers of squamous epithelium, were observed. Ciliated or mucus cells were not detected. It can be stated that the epithelium formation on incorporated porous implants is possible. Further studies of the stability and the differentiation process of the epithelium on such implants is needed before an introduction of tracheal replacements into the clinical practice can be considered.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,OTORHINOLARYNGOL CLIN,CHARITE HOSP,BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,DERMATOL CLIN,CHARITE HOSP,BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,INST ANAT,BERLIN,GERMANY; INST TEXT RES & CHEM ENGN,DENKENDORF,GERMANY",,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Filling a defect by the application of autogenous bone is one of them. Autogenous cancellous bone is still considered to be the gold standard, but numerous shortcomings of this material, described in detail in the paper, are not taken into account. Besides, we are still unable to influence bone healing by the transplantation of autogenous bone with reference to quality, quantity of newly forming bone and the time period, in which bone healing occurs. Investigation into the different kinds of biomaterial developed to replace autogenous bone as a transplant, and their implantation into experimental animals did not result in the production of a synthetic material that was: as active as autogenous or even allogeneic cancellous bone. This was therefore not a solution to the problem. The reasons for this are multiple and are discussed in this paper. We developed a classification for bone replacement materials that differentiates between biological, synthetic, and composed materials, i.e., composite biomaterials made for bone replacement. In reference to the literature, as well as our own results, based on the implantation of more than 1200 rats, dogs and sheep with distinct materials, the plus/minus effects of the different classes, groups and subgroups of bone replacement materials are summarized and discussed. The most recent knowledge about the mechanisms of bone formation and how it is influenced by different growth factors, as well as bioactive ceramics, indicates that in the future an applicable bone replacement material will be a composite of a carrier material combined with chemotactic, inductive, morphogenetic and proliferative, chemically pure, recombinant factors, with a mainly local action.

Our laboratory has developed a method of impregnating biomaterials with suspensions containing bioactive proteins resulting in the capability of differentially modulating EC and SMC growth in vitro and in vivo following implantation. We have previously reported that 60 mu internodal distance ePTFE grafts impregnated with fibrin glue (FG) containing FGF-1 and heparin develop confluent endothelialization with transiently increased EC and SMC proliferation after 4 weeks in dogs. Thoraco-abdominal implants after 20 weeks were developed significantly thicker (139 mu) inner capsules in response to the FGF. To minimize SMC proliferation we studied the effects of FGF-1, heparin, and thrombin concentrations on SMC growth in vitro. FG caused a 182% increase (P < 0.001) in DNA synthesis. Heparin within FG diminished this effect in a dose-dependant manner, with complete inhibition of FG-induced growth at 500 U ml(-1) (versus FG alone, P < 0.001). FGF-1 within FG without heparin had no effect, but together, FGF-1 caused a dose-dependant growth increase while increasing heparin concentrations initially increased and then decreased proliferation. FGF-1 and heparin in the medium of quiescent SMCs had similar effects. Only thrombin concentrations > 3.2 U ml(-1) stimulated SMC growth and this stimulation was blocked by heparin. A synergism between FGF and heparin on EC proliferation was also found but without EC growth inhibition in response to higher concentrations of heparin. It is thus possible to modulate the relative proliferative activity of ECs versus SMCs by altering the FGF:heparin ratio. This same system may be useful with other proteins to induce other local affects by the applied protein or systemic affects following release of that protein.","EDWARD HINES JR VET ADM HOSP,HINES,IL 60141; ST BARNABAS HOSP,LIVINGSTON,NJ 07039","Greisler, HP (reprint author), LOYOLA UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT SURG,2160 S 1ST AVE,MAYWOOD,IL 60153, USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL41272, R01 HL29268]",,,15,65,69,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1996.0,17,3,,,,,329,336,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)85571-2,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,TY459,WOS:A1996TY45900012,8745330.0,,,,2019-02-25

A number of extensively used polymeric biomaterials (i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) and its copolymers with a series of acrylic monomers- acrylic acid and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate- polyetherurethane and polypropylene (PP)) was prepared by using suitable polymerization methods. Their surface structures were characterized by wettability and surface free energy measurements, scanning electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. It was found that these surfaces have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.0 erg cm(-2) with different charge and charge densities. The adherence of two strains of Escherichia coli (non-pathogen and pathogen) isolated from indigenous flora of trachea and pathogen flora of urethral surfaces, and uropathogenic Candida albicans to the polymeric surfaces was studied in vitro by means of microscopic techniques. The hydrophobicity of cell surfaces was determined by using two methods including adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements. The uropathogenic E. coli and C. albicans were found to be relatively hydrophobic with a similar surface free energy, approximately 40 erg cm(-2), when compared with normal E. coli strain which has 61 erg cm(-2) free energy. The uropathogenic strains were poorly adherent to hydrophilic polymer surfaces while showing excellent adherence on hydrophobic PP surfaces.

For analytical purposes, characterization using megaelectron-volt He2+ ions provides a standardless, nondestructive means for accurately quantifying the composition of material surfaces and the thickness of thin films. In this study, three complementary ion backscattering techniques were utilized to characterize hydroxyapatite (HA) films: Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) can determine composition and amounts of elements heavier than He; forward recoil elastic spectrometry (FRES) can determine hydrogen content; resonance-enhanced RBS can quantify small amounts of light elements, e.g. carbon, by choosing a particular incident beam energy resulting in excitation of the light element nucleus. At this resonance energy, the scattering cross section greatly incsreases, improving elemental sensitivity. Sol-gel chemistry was used to synthesize HA films by spin coating and annealing in a rapid thermal processor. Using these techniques, the chemical composition of unfired films was Ca1.63O5.4H1.8C0.24P with a thickness of 3.01 x 10(18) atoms/cm(2) and after firing at 800 degrees C as Ca1.66O4.0H0.26C0.09P with a thickness of 2.11 x 10(18) atoms/cm(2).

Two commercial polymers: polyethylene (PE) and silicone rubber (SR) and two laboratory-synthesized polyurethanes were examined. The polyurethanes studied consisted of a polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO)-based polyurethane (PEU-base) and a sulfonated polyurethane (PEU-S03). in vitro polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion and respiratory burst activity measurements were studied using a radiolabelling technique and a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, respectively. An increased number of adherent PMNs and increased cell spreading were found on PEU-S03 compared to the PEU-base, SR and PE. The largest CL response was also found on PEU-SO3, whereas on the other hydrophobic polymers the response was smaller. Additionally, on the PEU-SO3 surface the CL response was sustained indicating more prolonged production of oxygen radicals by PMNs on this material. Upon stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OZ), the PMNs on PEU-S03 showed the lowest CL response, indicating a decreased respiratory burst activity. The other hydrophobic surfaces, PE, SR and PEU-base, showed no significant differences among them in their CL response. The residual CL response was reduced by 30% for PEU-SO3 and by 10-15% for PE, SR and PEU-base compared to the control (luminometer polystyrene cuvette only, no disc). Upon addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), all surfaces except SR showed a slightly reduced CL response. Along with PE, PEU-S03 showed the lowest CL response. These results suggest that oxygen radicals are produced during early incubation of PMNs with biomaterials, and upon subsequent stimulation of these cells, fewer oxygen radicals are produced due to cellular exhaustion.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,,,,43,9,10,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

A wide variety of materials has been used for these implants, but only a few promote osseointegration and biointegration. Titanium and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) have been the most widely used of these materials. The surface oxide of titanium appears to be central to the ability of this material to osseointegrate. The oxide limits dissolution of elements and promotes the deposition of biological molecules which allow bone to exist as close as 30 Angstrom to the surface of the implant. The details of the ultrastructure of the gap between the implant and bone remain undefined, and the consequences of elements which are released on the interface over time are not known. These areas of investigation are particularly important in defining the differences between commercially pure titanium implants and those made of titanium, aluminium and vanadium. The epithelial interface between the gingiva and titanium appears to contain many of the structural characteristics of the native tooth-gingiva interface, but details are still vague. The connective tissue interface with the titanium appears to be one of tightly fitting tissues rather than adhesion. Ceramic coatings appear to improve the ingrowth of bone and promote chemical integration of the implant with the bone. The characteristics of these coatings are complex and affect the bony response, but the mechanisms remain obscure. The degradation of the coatings is an issue of particular controversy. Progress in dental implantology is likely to continue as the interface between the material and bone is more clearly understood, and biological molecules and artificial tissues are developed.",,"Wataha, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL REHABIL, AUGUSTA, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,63,37,39,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The properties and overall integrity of mineralized tissues are in part dictated by the nature of their interfaces-sites where organic and inorganic components of the extracellular matrix interact to provide biomechanical strength, regulate mineral ion homeostasis, and influence cellular events involved in mineralized tissue modeling, remodeling, and repair. High-resolution, colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry has been used to characterize the proteinaceous composition of these interfaces and to establish that the phosphorylated sialoprotein, OPN, is a major component found at these sites where it accumulates as a dense, planar ''coating'' of organic material termed either a cement line or a lamina limitans. Structural/functional features of OPN predict an ability of this protein to regulate calcification in the matrix proper of mineralized tissues and to participate, more specifically, in cell-matrix and matrix-matrix/mineral adhesion in laminae limitantes and cement lines, respectively. From the ultrastructural immunocytochemical data presented herein for OPN illustrating the cellular expression and extracellular matrix distribution of this protein, it is demonstrated that the production of OPN is one of the earliest, and latest, secretory activities of the osteoblast lineage and that this activity manifests itself morphologically as a cement line or a lamina limitans, respectively, at bone matrix interfaces. In laminae limitantes at bone surfaces, OPN appears to be involved in osteoclast adhesion and possibly haptotaxis. An OPN-containing cement line is also present at hard tissue interfaces in rat tooth, against osseointegrated titanium and hydroxyapatite implants and at the margins of surgically created bone defects-and there may influence biological adhesion in a manner similar to that proposed for normal bone. It is suggested, therefore, that in addition to its potential for influencing cell adhesion/dynamics in bones and teeth, OPN in cement lines may act as an interfacial adhesion promoter between apposing substrates, therein maintaining the overall integrity of bone during the bone remodeling sequence and ''bonding'' dissimilar tissues (or biocompatible materials) together in biological composites such as teeth and osseointegrated implants.

Using an open surgical procedure, 23 double-J stents of 8 different types were inserted in the ureters of 13 piglets. After 6 weeks intubation, 2 (9%) of the 23 stented renal units yielded positive urine culture. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed sporadic bacteria on 7 (30%) of the 23 indwelling ureteric stents and bacterial biofilms on only 2 (9%), those indwelling the renal units which yielded positive urine cultures. Precut segments of the 8 double-J stent brands were incubated with 5 different bacterial strains. Microbiological and SEM analysis of the stents revealed that only 0.1-0.01% of the bacterial inoculum adhered to the stents. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial adherence to the various stent materials. Interestingly, the two Escherichia coli strains with P-fimbriae adhered significantly more than the two without P-fimbriae. Sporadic bacterial adhesion to ureteric stents seemed to have little clinical significance whereas biofilm formation seemed to result in urinary tract infection. None of the tested stents proved to be superior to the others in this respect, and adhesion appeared to depend on the virulence of the bacteria rather than the properties of the biomaterials.","HELSINKI UNIV,CENT HOSP,DEPT SURG 4,HELSINKI,FINLAND; HELSINKI UNIV,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; PAIJAT HAME CENT HOSP,DEPT SURG,UROL UNIT,LAHTI,FINLAND; UNIV BARI,SCH MED,BARI,ITALY",,,,,,,,21,28,28,0,8,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0036-5599,,,SCAND J UROL NEPHROL,Scand.

In this study, a new attempt was made to coat bioactive glasses on Ti-6A1-4V by plasma spraying. This method will coat the bioactive glass coatings (BGCs) onto metal substrate, potentially combining the excellent mechanical strength of metal and biocompatibility of bioactive glass. Analysis by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the BGCs, revealed that the amorphous structure of glass was preserved. BGCs were soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF) to evaluate their properties in vitro. After soaking in SBF for 1 day, precipitation of fiber structure was observed on the surface of the BGCs. After 2 and more days, the surface of the BGCs was completely covered with precipitates. The precipitates, identified as the apatite phase by XRD, contained carbonate and hydroxyl functional groups detected by Fourier transform IR reflection (FTIR) spectroscopy. After soaking for 16 days, a thin layer of about 10 FM, rich in calcium and phosphorus but poor in silicon, was observed on the surface of the BGCs. The composition of the Ca-P rich layer was consistent with the apatite structure identified by various methods, but the apatite layer was significantly thicker than reported in bulk form. The formation of an apatite phase surface has been suggested to be indicative of biocompatibility. All findings in this study indicated the formation of apatite on the surface of plasma-sprayed BGCs, and this material is expected to be biocompatible in vivo.","NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,TAINAN,TAIWAN; NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,CTR MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAINAN,TAIWAN",,,"Lee, Tzer-Min/G-3713-2011",,,,,31,35,39,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0257-8972,,,SURF COAT TECH,Surf.

The MEOnPC could polymerize with n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) in ethanol using a conventional radical polymerization technique. The unit mole fraction of MEOnPC in the polymer corresponded to that in the feed monomer solution. The MEOnPC polymers were soluble in ethanol, insoluble in water, but swelled in water and became hydrated. On the surface of a poly(BMA) membrane coated with MEOnPC, the phosphorylcholine groups of the MEOnPC unit present were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a fundamental evaluation for biomedical materials, adsorption of one of the plasma proteins, fibrinogen, on acrylic beads coated with the MEOnPC polymers was evaluated. The amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on the MEOnPC polymer was smaller than that on the original acrylic beads, poly(BMA) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The increase in the MEOnPC unit mole fraction in the polymer showed more effective protein adsorption-resistant properties.

The interface in all animals consisted of collagenous tissue. The amount of collagenous fibres was related to the amount of residual movement within the motion segment: animals undergoing anterior plating after reconstruction of the bone defect presented with more or less compactly organized collagenous tissue. Sequential fluorochromic marking of osteoid formation revealed a vital bone bed around the interface but no signs of direct bone apposition to the ionomer cement plug.

The poly (beta-hydroxybutyrate-beta-hydroxyvalerate), a biopolymer considered as being biodegradable and biocompatible, has been recently introduced for orthopaedic biomaterials and regeneration pur poses. In our study, a PHB/9% HV polymer was transformed into 3D foams, then applied to the culture 3D of ovine chondrocytes (fibrous rings & growth plates) and osteoblasts (periostum). Sponges made ofbovine type I collagen were used as references. Orthopaedic cells were isolated, prepared and sown by simple injection to the geometrical center of the substrata, then incubated from 0 to 35 days by changing the culture medium all 4 days. Maximal densities were reached after 21 days: 18-24.10(6) cells/g for the chondrocytes, 8-10.10(6) cells/g for the osteoblasts. The cellular proliferation was more marked, with highest cell densities, for the collagen sponges. Laser confocal microscopy shows that the cellular diffusion take place throughout the entire volume of the porous artificial substrata. Future studies will allow to apply the porous bioabsorbable substrata to high-density cell cultures, to the tissue engineering and regeneration, for example for orthopaedic tissues: cartilage, fibrocartilage and bone.",,"Rivard, CH (reprint author), HOP ST JUSTINE, CTR RECH PEDIAT, LAB BIOMECAN ORTHOPED, 3175 CHEMIN COTE ST CATHERINE, MONTREAL, PQ H3T 1C5, CANADA.",,,,,,,34,56,63,0,8,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX,"65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE",0003-3944,,,ANN CHIR,Ann.

In 1991, Allegheny General Hospital and Allegheny-Singer Research Institute purchased a centrifugal pump, then a 2-year-old technology, from Medtronic Bio-Medicus, as part of its research program for novel treatments of acute and chronic heart failure. During a 4-year development program, we then established and met goals of durability, performance, thromboresistance, and low cost. Methods. In vitro testing involved extensive hydraulic characterizations using Penn State mock loops. Calorimetry was used to determine efficiency. Durability studies used heated (37 degrees C) seawater for 28 to 45 days. In vivo studies used 46 sheep to test performance and engineering changes and to determine myocardial oxygen consumption, thromboresistance, and long-term durability. A left atrium-to-aorta circuit was used in all. Results. Hydraulic testing showed no preload sensitivity but moderate afterload sensitivity at all impeller speeds (2,000 to 6,000 rpm). The heat load was low, and overall efficiency was 13% to 15%. Bench durability studies showed no electrical malfunction of the stator or console without degradation of the biomaterials used. Acute in vitro studies showed a near-linear relationship of myocardial oxygen consumption and left ventricular stroke work, pump now, and pump speed. At speeds of 2 to 3 L/min (50% bypass), left ventricular stroke work and myocardial oxygen consumption were decreased approximately 50%. Additionally, 5 animals have had implants for 28 to 154 days with no macroemboli or microemboli detected in any animal.

In a clinical setting, endothelialization of a graft can be achieved using higher cell seeding densities, or by creating a surface on which EC can adhere and grow to confluence. But, human endothelial cells show little or no proliferation on the currently available graft materials. In this study, surface modification of PTFE and ePTFE by ammonia plasma treatment was carried out to enhance its interactions with ECM protein, EC growth factors, and with EC harvested from human umbilical vein (HUVEC), and from human saphenous veins (HSVEC). Our data shows that various vascular graft materials generated from ammonia plasma treated PTFE and ePTFE exhibited statistically significant improvements in HUVEC and HSVEC growth when compared to their respective controls (p values < 0.001). Growth of HSVEC on ammonia plasma treated ePTFE without ECM protein coating was also found to be statistically significant in comparison to that on fibronectin coated ePTFE (p < 0.001). The final HSVEC cell densities found on various ePTFE surfaces prepared from ammonia plasma treated ePTFE, suggests that transplantation of HSVEC monolayers on vascular prostheses can be established within clinically relevant times.

This important process, however, is known as poorly understood in the area in polymer science. One of the reasons is that the conventional method of examining the swelling process is often inconsistent. Since it has many important properties including non-invasiveness, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Micro-imaging has become a significant method of analyzing biomaterials as well as biological specimens [1,2]. In the present study, a time-dependent swelling process was observed non-invasively to investigate the polymeric swelling effect using NMR micro-imaging. The present study provides a noble and non-invasive method of measuring the degree of swelling as well as volumetric changes occurring in polymers immersed in liquid. The information obtained relates to both a water ingress process and volumetric changes of polymer specimens. This proposed method also will provide more reliable techniques to ascertain the time-dependent swelling process than the other conventional methods. One of the important aspects of the present study is that the proposed method is a non-invasive technique and is also capable of ascertaining the time-dependent process of the swelling. This may be a new method of measuring the degree of swelling as well as the time-dependent water ingress process in a polymer.","PAI CHAI UNIV,DEPT PHYS,SU KU,TAEJON,SOUTH KOREA; KAIST,DEPT INFORMAT & COMMUN ENGN,SEOUL,SOUTH KOREA; KRICT,BIOMAT LAB,TAEJON,SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,3,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The following dairy biomaterials were chosen for investigations: three kefir bacterial cultures and one bacterial concentrate of a dairy vaccine. Experiments were performed both at one-region conductive or radiative heating and at combined two-region conductive-radiative heating. Emphasis was put on quality interactions between physical and biological properties of the material to be dried and freeze drying process parameters. Qualitative estimations of the following properties of biomaterials: a) colour, b) suppleness to caking and c) suppleness to scraping from the hot surface in dependence with the process parameters were performed using four-step subjective scales. On the basis of this estimations a synthetic quality criterion SQC was defined whose numerical value reflects general product quality. The results of mathematical modelling, numerical solution of the model and comparison with experimental data indicated that the process was heat transfer controlled and that the main factors resulting in good product quality and high SQC are low temperature of the conductive heated surface and vacuum chamber pressure affecting sublimation temperature. The influence of the sample freezing parameters on the elimination of the foaming or puffing and on the product quality was observed and examined.

As a consequence, dried biomaterials demand will rise and equipments will have to be built or redesigned to accommodate changes. The design and innovations on industrial dryers require fundamental knowledge conceived in laboratory units. The new heat pump dryer operates at a wide relative humidity and the air temperature is adjustable from -20 to 100 degrees C. Above and below freezing point drying modes are done in the same plant which allows the control of biomaterial properties. The technique consists of two stages, unbound weakly held water removal by freeze drying, and tightly bound moisture desorption by medium temperature drying. The fluidized and shelf heat pump dryers have the required features to dry heat sensitive biomaterials. The dryers were built and extensive research on biomaterials has been conducted at The Norwegian Institute of Technology. Many experiments were done on effect of heat pump drying conditions on enzyme and biological active bacteria solutions, fruits, cod fish, fish feed and shrimps. At optimum heat drying conditions, the bacteria Rhodococcus reached 100% viability and dried biomolecules attained full biological activity. The heat pump dryer allowed adjustment of the biomaterial properties and quality according to its phase, shape and size. Dried samples showed improvements on survival rate, rehydration, colour, hardness and mono-multimolecular sorption isotherms over poorly dried products. Beneficial results were achieved for nearly all tests.

Microbial spore sterilization by adiabatic expansion of water pressurized to over 600 MPa has been demonstrated. The sterilization of Bacillus stearothermophilus spores has been achieved by six consecutive adiabatic expansion cycles at temperatures below 70 degrees C. Twin-screw extrusion has been successfully applied to destroy allergens in proteinaceous food and feed materials such as soy flour, but could not be demonstrated with soybean. hulls of high carbohydrate content. It has been shown that allergens of buckwheat and soy pours can be partially destroyed by high shear using twin-screw extrusion cooking. Microparticulation technology using a jet mill has been employed to increase the surface hydrophobicity of proteinaceous particles milled to less than 3 mu m in diameter in order to prepare fat replacers Biodegradable loose fill packing, material has been prepared from corn starch by extrusion cooking.

This review discusses several critical controversies in this field and lay special emphasis on the cellular and biochemical reactions related to the formation mechanisms of lipofuscin, ceroid, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and age pigment-like fluorophores (APFs). Various amino compounds and their reaction with secondary aldehydic products of oxygen free radical-induced oxidation, particularly lipid peroxidation, are important sources of the fluorophores of ceroid/lipofuscin, which progressively accumulate as a result of phagocytosis and autophagocytosis of modified biomaterials within secondary lysosomes of postmitotic and other cells. Lipofuscin is the classical age pigment of postmitotic cells, while ceroid accumulates due to pathologic and experimental processes. There are good reasons to consider both ceroid and lipofuscin as materials of the same principal origin. The age-related intracellular fluorophores of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seems to represent a special class of lipofuscin, which partly contains derivatives of retinoids and carotenoids. Saccharide-originated fluorophores, principally AGEs formed during glycation/Maillard reactions, may be mainly responsible for the extracellular fluorescence of long-lived proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and lens crystalline. Although lipofuscin, ceroid, AGEs, and APFs can be produced from different types of biological materials due to different side reactions of essential biology, the crosslinking of carbonyl-amino compounds is recognized as a common process during their formation.",,"Yin, DZ (reprint author), LINKOPING UNIV, DEPT PATHOL, S-58185 LINKOPING, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,187,284,314,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0891-5849,1873-4596,,FREE RADICAL BIO MED,Free Radic.

These compliant layered cups must also exhibit considerable rigidity to resist the pinching action of the acetabulum during normal gait, especially in cases where the subchondral bone is removed during insertion. Hence, a stiff cup backing is required to compensate for the rigidity lost when using the soft layer. During normal loading conditions two areas of mechanical failure exist within the cup. Firstly, delamination due to varied material stiffness and secondly, loosening due to excess stresses at the cement or cup/bone interface. Also, adverse conditions may arise following periods of prolonged static loading, where the fluid film may break down allowing the articulating surfaces to come into direct asperity contact, resulting in higher frictional coefficients. In this study the stress analysis was performed using the finite element method. A 2D FE model of a pelvic slice was used to evaluate stress distributions in the cement layer and immediate surrounding bone for various cup stiffnesses. While, a 3D finite element model was used to analyse the effects of both friction and aspect ratio upon the stress distribution within the elastomeric layer Results obtained correlated well with established mathematical and/or FEA predictions The validity of both mathematical and FEA predicted results for the compliant layer stress analysis was assessed using experimentally obtained reaction forces and displacements. Although further work is currently being carried out to achieve the optimum cup design, a cup configuration to reduce both the cup and pelvic stresses was established and analysed using material properties typical of available biomaterials.",,"Bryan, KJ (reprint author), UNIV LIMERICK,DEPT MAT SCI & TECHNOL,LIMERICK,IRELAND.",,"Irish Centre for Composites, Research (ICOMP)/D-4887-2011",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS,CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE,"EINERSBERGER BLICK 28, PO BOX 266, W-3392 CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE, GERMANY",1013-9826,,0-87849-723-4,KEY ENG MAT,,,1996.0,118-,,,,,,347,354,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.118-119.347,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Materials Science,BF75N,WOS:A1996BF75N00040,,,,,2019-02-25

In particular, it demonstrates that macroscopic images ('stains'), that assess the spatial distribution of albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, and HMK (high molecular weight kininogen), can be obtained over areas of at least 12 cm(2) using immunospecific adhesion of dyed polystyrene beads. Stain intensities, measured with a scanner and an image analysis system, were found to quantify the amount of specific protein in the solution used to coat the surfaces. Results obtained with the proposed method produced single protein isotherms for albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fibrinogen that followed Langmuir-like adsorption behavior and were similar to previously published isotherms. The HMK isotherm also exhibited Langmuir-like adsorption behavior. The proposed method also detected the presence of an expected maximum in the adsorption of fibrinogen onto glass as a function of plasma dilution. Adsorption of fibrinogen out of 6.4% plasma onto glass from a separated flow produced results indicating the quantity as well as the location of fibrinogen at the boundary of the separated region. This result confirmed the utility of the proposed method for detecting spatial distributions of specific proteins adsorbed from plasma in practical devices.","COLUMBIA UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN MAT SCI & MIN ENGN,ARTIFICIAL ORGANS RES LAB,NEW YORK,NY 10027",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-44535],,,38,5,5,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The amount of proteins adsorbed on the PC-polymer from human plasma was smaller than that on not only the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) but also the OH-polymer and MeO-polymer. The PC group could weaken the interaction between plasma proteins and polymer surfaces. The amount of adsorbed proteins on the PC-polymer decreased with an increase in the mole fraction of the PC units in the polymers. We could observe an effect of the oxyethylene chain length (n is the number of repeating units of oxyethylene) on protein adsorption between n=2 and n=3. The platelet adhesion on these polymer surfaces was evaluated using rabbit platelet-rich plasma. On the polymers without the PC group, that is, poly(BMA), OH-polymer, and MeO-polymer, many platelets adhered and a considerable shape change in the adherent platelets occurred. On the other hand, the PC-polymers could effectively suppress platelet adhesion. The platelet adhesion behavior on the polymers was strongly dependent on the adsorbed proteins. Platelet adhesion was completely inhibited on all of the PC-polymers studied having a 0.3 PC unit mole fraction. However, it was observed that the oxyethylene chains on the PC-polymers with a 0.1 PC unit mole fraction affected platelet adhesion.","NIHON UNIV,COLL SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT IND CHEM,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN","Iwasaki, Y (reprint author), TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,CHIYODA KU,2-3-10 KANDA SURUGADAI,TOKYO 101,JAPAN.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,44,30,31,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The total amount of proteins adsorbed on the polymer surface from human plasma was determined, and the distribution of adsorbed proteins on the plasma-contacting surface was analyzed. The amount of proteins adsorbed on every poly(MAPC-co-BMA) was small compared with that observed on polymers without the phospholipid polar group. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of adsorbed proteins on the poly(MAPC-co-BMA) even when the methylene chain length between the phospholipid polar group and the backbone in the MAPC moiety was altered. Platelet adhesion on the polymer surface from a platelet suspension in a buffered solution was evaluated with and without plasma treatment on the surface. When a rabbit platelet suspension was brought into contact with the poly(BMA) surface after treatment with plasma, many platelets adhered and aggregated. However, a reduced amount of platelet adhered on the poly(BMA) was found in the case of direct contact with the platelet suspension. On the other hand, the poly(MAPC-co-BMA)s could inhibit platelet adhesion under both conditions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the proteins adsorbed on the surface play an important role in determining the platelet adhesion and suppression of the protein adsorption on the surface, which is one of the most significant ways of inhibiting platelet adhesion.","TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN; NIHON UNIV,COLL SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT IND CHEM,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN",,,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,40,48,50,0,9,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Other changes in adsorbed fibrinogen such as decreases in polyclonal antibody binding and SDS elutability supported the conclusion that fibrinogen undergoes postadsorptive conformational changes. Subsequently we measured the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the three putative platelet binding sites on fibrinogen, using a single mid-range concentration of antibody. We found that binding of a monoclonal antibody to the platelet binding site at the C-terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen changed little with residence time, while binding of monoclonal antibodies to the other two putative binding sites on fibrinogen either increased with residence time (RGDF at A alpha 95-98), or first increased and then decreased with residence time (RGDS at A alpha 572-575). In the current study, we measured antibody binding affinity, K-a, by measuring antibody binding at a series of antibody concentrations. This is a more sensitive method for detecting changes in adsorbed fibrinogen than measuring antibody binding from a single antibody concentration. The K-a was determined for two antibodies, M1 (4A5), which binds to a platelet binding domain of fibrinogen (gamma 402-411) and R1 (155 B1616), which binds to residues 87-100 of the A alpha chain (containing an RGDF site). A summary of the results for the M1 antibody are as follows. The K-a was higher for M1 binding to fibrinogen adsorbed to Immulon I(R) than to Biomer(R), Biospan(R) or poly(ethylene terephthalate), suggesting that fibrinogen adsorbed to Immulon I(R) is more platelet adhesive than fibrinogen adsorbed to the other polymers. On Biospan(R), the K-a decreased from 2.8 x 10(9) to 1.0 x 10(9) M(-1) after a 24 h 37 degrees C residence time, which correlated with the decrease in platelet adhesiveness of adsorbed fibrinogen observed previously under these conditions. The change in K-a was greater when adsorbed fibrinogen was kept under denaturing conditions. For example, the K-a decreased from 2.8 x 10(9) to 0.8 x 10(9) M(-1) after a 1 h 70 degrees C residence time whereas it remained approximately the same, 2.9 x 10(9) M(-1), after a 24 h 0 degrees C residence time.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT CHEM ENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; CHENGDU UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT POLYMER SCI,CHENGDU 610065,SICHUAN,PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL19419],,,37,26,26,0,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The immobilization of PEO was carried out with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in aqueous media. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain a maximal coupling of PEG. The degree of coupling was determined by the surface concentration of amino groups. The maximal surface concentrations of amino groups were close to what is expected for a complete coverage of the surface with PEG. Adsorption of albumin from a buffer solution onto PEG-containing surfaces was about 85% less than the albumin uptake by unmodified polystyrene latices. Protein adsorption from plasma dilutions was lower on surfaces containing PEO molecules with a higher molecular weight. The reduction of the protein uptake from plasma by surfaces containing PEO-3400 molecules was only 40% compared to the adsorption to unmodified surfaces. These results indicate that plasma proteins have a low affinity for surfaces modified with PEO.

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis results showed a characteristic sulfur (S) and sodium (Na) peaks after modification with dextran sulfate. The sulfur/carbon (S/C) atomic composition ratio increased from 0.03 to 0.08 when the bulk dextran sulfate concentration used for modification was increased from 2.5 to 10 mg ml(-1). The permeability of urea and creatinine did not change significantly upon modification with heparin or dextran sulfate. Surface modification, however, did decrease the permeability coefficients of glucose, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-12. Unlike Cuprophan, chitosan and surface-modified chitosan membranes did not significantly activate the complement system as measured by the serum iC3b concentration. Compared to forty and sixty fully-activated platelets present on control surfaces, surface modification with heparin and dextran sulfate significantly reduced the number of adherent platelets per 25000 mu m(2) area and the extent of platelet activation. Surface modification with anionic polysaccharides, however, did significantly shorten the plasma recalcification time leading to fibrin clot formation.

In previous investigations we have demonstrated that hydrophilic materials bind preadsorbed fibronectin that can easily be reorganized by fibroblasts in a specific matrix-like structure, while on less wettable materials (possessing water contact angles above 60 deg) the cells were unable to do this. As the cells continuously produce their fibronectin matrix, we tried in this study to answer the question of how the surface wettability of biomaterials influences the endogenous fibronectin matrix formation and its subsequent organization on the substrate. We cultured fibroblasts for 72 h on five different wettable surfaces: glass, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, pellethane, polyvinylchloride, and silicone, with water-contact angles gradually ranging from 25 to 105 deg. We demonstrated that the decreasing wettability of the materials significantly reduced endogenous fibronectin deposition on the substratum. Moreover, fibrillar organization of fibronectin appeared only on relatively hydrophilic glass and APS substrate, while on more hydrophobic materials like PVC and SI, cells secreted some fibronectin but were not able to organize it into a fibronectin matrix. These results were correlated with an altered cell morphology and spreading on these materials. In addition, an ELISA method has been implemented to quantify fibronectin matrix formation as a possible measure of the biocompatibility of materials, where a clear relation has been found between fibroblast growth and fibronectin matrix formation.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,INST CHEM,DEPT MEMBRANE RES,D-14513 TELTOW,GERMANY","Altankov, G (reprint author), BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOPHYS,STR ACAD G BONCHEV,BL 21,SOFIA 1113,BULGARIA.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,34,39,44,1,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

However, its importance and relevance justify all the efforts made. An interdisciplinary approach is required. We report on our study of a product for bone substitution. Coral is a natural product, the interest of which we have already demonstrated in our previous work. Following sterilization, natural coral was implanted in sheep femurs. We regularly extracted the implants from the femurs to study the kinetics of elemental mineral transformation of the bone substitutes. For the first time ever, and thanks to the PIXE method (particles induced X-ray emission), we were able to measure the concentration of mineral elements at different time intervals after implantation over a whole cross-section. We found a discontinuity of the mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Fe) at the interface between the implant and the receiver. This shows that the osseous attack is not global but, on the contrary, centripetal. Moreover, the fit of the concentration time course indicates that the kinetics of ossification are different for each atomic element and characterize a distinct biological phenomenon. Our analyses confirm the biocompatibility and the ossification of the implanted coral.","UNIV CLERMONT FERRAND,F-63177 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE; IPNE,B-4000 LIEGE,BELGIUM; ATOM ENERGY ORG IRAN,TEHRAN,IRAN; HOP HOTEL DIEU,SERV CHIRURG INFANTILE,F-63000 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE","Irigaray, JL (reprint author), CNRS,IN2P3,LAB PHYS CORPUSULAIRE CLERMONT FERRAND,F-63177 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE.",,,,,,,9,8,8,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The results showed that the hydrophilic plasma polymerized PEO and PNVP films on DDS-glass did not prevent platelet adhesion and activation. The film thickness had only marginal influence on the prevention of platelet activation. In contrast, platelet adhesion was prevented on DDS-glass adsorbed with a PEO-containing block copolymer (Pluronic(R) F-108 surfactant) even at a calculated thickness of the PEO layer of less than 40 nm. This study shows that surface hydrophilization is not sufficient for prevention of platelet adhesion and activation. The contrasting results in platelet adhesion between cross-linked plasma polymers and linear PEO-containing block copolymers may be explained qualitatively by a steric repulsion mechanism that is achieved by the conformational freedom of the linear PEO chains interacting with water.","PURDUE UNIV,SCH PHARM,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,43,28,28,0,4,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To further explore the effects of this premature activation, we evaluated the supernatants of biomaterial associated neutrophils to determine whether soluble mediators were released, and the likely role of these mediators. We show that these supernatants contain a chemoattractant and thereby induce chemotaxis by fresh neutrophils. No evidence of enhanced oxidative free radical production by either unstimulated neutrophils or a primed response to other mediators occurs when neutrophils were incubated with these supernatants. We also examined the effect of adding fresh neutrophils to a biomaterial surface containing a previous inoculum of neutrophils, and observed that the fresh cells did not become stimulated to release reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and also exhibited impaired killing of staphylococci. These studies suggest that not only does the biomaterial surface activate the initial wave of neutrophils but that subsequent waves of neutrophils exhibit an impaired host-defense function. These results are consistent with the known impairment of host defense in the presence of biomaterials, and provide evidence for a long-term down-regulation of neutrophil function at biomaterial surfaces.

A foreign-body reaction was the characteristic host tissue response against the implants. The resorption of the implanted materials was analyzed by measuring both the weight and the collagen persistences. This last was measured by using (C-14)acetylated collagen, which was revealed to be not modified upon radioactive labeling, in terms of its ability to form a complex with sepiolite. The persistence of the implants is controllable by treatment of the collagen component with glutaraldehyde. Thus, for 1% glutaraldehyde-treated collagen complexes, 100% of persistence was observed after several months of implantation, this value decreasing to a few days for nontreated collagen samples. The collagen-sepiolite complex showed a low immunological response, almost null for 1% glutaraldehyde-treated collagen complexes, which was analyzed by measuring anti-collagen antibodies levels. Based on the performed studies, sepiolite-collagen complexes can be considered a resorbable material.

The mechanisms whereby the implant surface may elicit and modulate leukocyte functions in vivo are not understood, partly due to the technical difficulties of examining the local inflammatory events in vicinity of the material-tissue interface with conventional biochemical and immunological techniques. In the present study a newly developed biplate implant was inserted subcutaneously in the mouse. Leukocytes from the local inflammatory exudate and leukocytes associated to the surface of the implants were retrieved after 1 and 6 days and separately assayed with respect to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production ex vivo. Implantation caused a local accumulation of predominantly mononuclear cells in the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. The H2O2 production was found to be low in both the subcutaneous exudate and the implant-associated leukocytes, irrespective of implant material and implantation times. However, ex vivo-stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused an enhanced H2O2, production. These observations show that biplate implants do not maximally activate the oxidative metabolism of the recruited leukocytes. The exudate leukocytes were more responsive to PMA stimulation in comparison with implant-associated leukocytes, indicating that properties of the implant surface and possibly surface-associated proteins could modify the responsiveness of the phagocytic cells at the implant site. Our results suggest that the present biplate model may be suitable for further studies on local production of oxygen metabolites and function of leukocytes at implanted biomaterials.

The large pores in the interior of these beads provide space for cell growth. However, it has been observed that the cell distribution in the interior of microcarriers is often uneven. In some cases, the pores appear to be unoccupied. Questions thus arise as to whether all pores are open to the bead surface, and whether the pores allow cell entry and proliferation. To examine the accessibility and geometrical features of the pores, laser scanning confocal microscope was used to optically section fluorescein isothiocyanate stained microcarriers. Three dimensional images were reconstructed by combining the sections for examination of the openness as well as the connectivity of the pores. By employing image processing software, the solid structure of the beads was removed from reconstructed three dimensional images to allow for direct visualization of the pores. A wide variety of geometries was observed; some pores were interconnected while others were segregated from each other. It was observed that while many pores were open to the surface through sufficiently large channels for cell entrance, a large number of pores was also either closed to the exterior or accessed the surface only through constricted channels which might impede cell entry. This confocal microscopic technique for direct evaluation of pore structure of macroporous beads is noninvasive and requires minimal sample preparation. It can easily be adapted for in situ observation of cell behavior as well as find application for structural assessment for various biomaterials.","UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT CHEM ENGN & MAT SCI,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455",,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,0,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

Beyond its immediate problems for the patients, the crisis has also discredited the use of silicone rubber as one of the most widely used biomaterials. Silicone elastomer or gel, the primary material in mammary prostheses, may be exposed to the body's tissues via envelope rupture, gel bleed, or elastomer fragmentation. Local responses to silicone include granulomatous inflammation, capsular contraction, and infection, all in varying degrees depending on ill-defined factors, which may include patient condition, peri- and postoperative complications, and hereditary predisposition, as well as material properties such as surface texture. The theory that silicone breast implants cause immunological disorders has not been proven. However, further study is necessary because some patients report autoimmune-like disorders (human adjuvant disease) following implant placement. Like autoimmune disease, human adjuvant disease is characterized by abnormalities of the immune response, autoantibody formation, and chronic inflammation. Silicone has been shown to play the role of an adjuvant, providing constant nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. Some researchers have hypothesized the role of silicone in specific immune reactions, including immunoglobulin formation and T-cell activation. This report examines the role of silicone as an agent of disease, focusing on material surface-tissue interactions.","CLEMSON UNIV, DEPT BIOENGN, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA; UNIV S CAROLINA, SCH MED, DEPT SURG, COLUMBIA, SC USA",,,,,,,,48,16,18,0,2,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Cement granulomas, micron-sized polyethylene particles-induced giant-celled granulomas, sheets of submicron-sized polyethylene particles-laden macrophages, and aggregated, metallic particles-laden macrophages were scattered in the fibrous tissue of all interfacial membranes. Quantitatively, characteristics of the interfacial membranes of the two groups differed from one another. The dominant species of prosthetic debris in the interfacial membranes of the short-term surviving joint replacements was derived from the polyethylene acetabular socket, and, correspondingly, giant-celled granulomas and macrophagic sheets predominated. Metallic particles and the macrophagic reaction thereto dominated in the interfacial membranes of the long-term surviving arthroplasties, and large cement and polyethylene chunks typically were incorporated in the fibrous tissue of the membranes without an accompanying macrophagic response. In long-term surviving hip arthroplasties, metallic particles may be at least as important as polymeric detritus in stimulating the formation of the bone-resorbing, granulomatous interfacial membrane, which is the hallmark of aseptically loosened arthroplasties. Differences in mechanical settings may account for unlike modes and rates of generation of prosthetic breakdown products, explaining the disparate survivorship of different patients' artificial joints.","BNAI ZION MED CTR, ASSOC PATIENTS IMPLANTED JOINTS, CTR IMPLANT SURG, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL","Boss, JH (reprint author), BNAI ZION MED CTR, ASSOC PATIENTS IMPLANTED JOINTS, DEPT PATHOL, POB 4940, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL.",,,,,,,78,10,10,0,3,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Thus, jaw bone cells grown on hydroxylapatite proliferated very little, while expressing discrete levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and of osteocalcin secretion into the growth medium. On the other hand, bone cells seeded onto titanium surfaces proliferated much more intensely than those on Thermanox(R), besides expressing alkaline phosphatase (very intensely after 5 days) and secreting osteocalcin. Thus, both kinds of titanium surfaces greatly enlarged the size of both populations of preosteoblastic precursors and of pre-osteoblasts in vitro, but plasma-sprayed titanium surfaces elicited, between day 2 and 5 in culture, greater increases in bone cell numbers markedly enhancing their proliferative and alkaline phosphatase activities, along with their osteocalcin secretion into the growth medium, and thus favouring the expression of the mature osteoblastic phenotype.

XPS spectra indicated that the MPC unit is located on the surface of PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III. The measurements of equilibrium water content and contact angle to water confirmed that the higher molecular weight of side chains results in higher hydrophilicity of PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III surface. The tensile modulus showed values of E=13.3 similar to 38.4 MPa for PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III films.

Two strategies are currently in use to achieve the goal of new blood compatible polymers: Firstly, existing cellulosic membranes are modified by introducing functional groups through ether and ester bonds and secondly, synthetic polymers are mixed with bull additives or copolymerized with other polymers. Biological responses as a consequence of blood/material interaction are common observations. However, blood compatibility in general cannot be improved by a single membrane surface feature. The assessment of a series of surface properties shows that physiological defense systems, like complement and cell activation, or coagulation are differently stimulated by means of the same surface structures of biomaterials. Thus, a compromise has to be found, already during membrane development. We synthetized a series of modifications of cellulosic membranes with the aim to investigate whether the type of substituent and its degree of substitution has an influence on the blood compatibility of these dialysis membranes. Data indicate that alterations in the lipophilic/hydrophilic balance (HLB) on the polymer surface may explain substituent-related changes in haemocompatibility. Optimal degrees of substitution are characteristic for a given type of substituent and enables the membrane manufacturer to tailor materials for improved blood compatibility.","AKZO NOBEL FASER AG,MEMBRANA,WUPPERTAL,GERMANY",,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,2,HUTHIG & WEPF VERLAG,BASEL,"AUF DEM WOLF 4 FX#001-41-61-317-94-11, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

To increase this knowledge the modification of polymer surfaces, their characterization, and the investigation of the response of the biosystem is considered to be a suitable approach. Surface modification may be performed in the wet-chemical way (heterogeneous reaction) or by means of treatment with a suitable plasma (glow discharge). Surface sensitive methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflexion mode as well as surface energy measurements are useful for surface characterization. To determine the bioresponse to the polymer surface, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, cell growth and full blood tests may be used. In the present paper several systems are described with respect to their surface modification, characterization, and bioresponse. It is shown that the protein adsorption is triggered by the surface, that SO2 plasma treatment enhances cell growth and that there seems to be a biocompatibility window for a surface characterized by a zeta-potential between -4 and -8 mV and a ratio of dispersive to polar contributions of surface energy around 12. It is stressed, however, that the final solution for a biomaterial is a material which, in the course of degradation, constantly presents a new biocompatible surface.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,DEUTSCH WOLLFORSCHUNGSINST,D-52062 AACHEN,GERMANY","Hocker, H (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,LEHRSTUHL TEXT CHEM & MAKROMOLEK CHEM,VELTMANPL 8,D-52062 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,8,5,5,0,3,HUTHIG & WEPF VERLAG,BASEL,"AUF DEM WOLF 4 FX#001-41-61-317-94-11, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

The results showed that as the nitrogen content increased, the tensile and fatigue strengths increased, the hardness increased slightly and the ductility decreased. The metallographic analysis showed that the nitrogen content had little effect on the grain size. When the nitrogen content in the alloy was increased, the formation of finer carbides of the M(6)C type was promoted ahead of the M(23)C(6) type.

Most interestingly, the number of staphylococci present in the biofilms covering rGM-CSF-coated implants were significantly lower than the number of bacteria detected on the surface of H-PE not coated with rGM-CSF. In vitro, rGM-CSF restored the anti-bacterial potency of the phagocytes, which had been reduced by surface contact with H-PE, The results suggest that modification of biomaterials with rGM-CSF could be one way of preventing staphylococcal infections; especially in neutropenic disorders, which constitute the highest risk factor for foreign body-associated infections.","UNIV LODZ,INST MICROBIOL & IMMUNOL,DEPT INFECT BIOL,PL-90237 LODZ,POLAND; LUND UNIV,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,2,CENTER ACADEMIC PUBL JAPAN,TOKYO,"4-16 YAYOI 2-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN",0385-5600,,,MICROBIOL IMMUNOL,Microbiol.

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, AN69(R)) dialysis membranes have been shown to improve the outcome of critically ill patients. Factor D is an essential enzyme of the alternative pathway of complement and is increased during renal failure. On the other hand the contact of blood with biomaterials activates the complement cascade through the alternative pathway. PAN filters adsorb factor D which looses its enzymatic activity whilst bound to the membrane [1]; the complement alternative pathway function of serum exposed to PAN filters is greatly diminished and restored after addition of purified factor D [1]. The aim of our study was to measure the time course of factor D adsorption and its blood concentration during CVVH in critically ill patients with acute renal failure. Methods. We studied seven critically ill patients with ARF before, during and after continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) with AN69. Results. There was a rapid decrease of factor D levels to 62(+/-6%) of the pre-CVVH value during the first 2 h, which continued to 51(+/-7.3%) after 12 h; at 24 h there was a slight rise to 62+/-12%. Sequential use of Polyacrylonitrile (AN69(R)) filters lowered factor D levels below the normal plasma concentration in three patients, thus producing a state of factor D depletion. Conclusion. The significant reduction of factor D levels during CVVH with PAN filters suggests that frequent changes of PAN filters may reduce alternative pathway function by lowering factor D levels. CVVH (as opposed to intermittent dialysis) with PAN membranes may further improve the outcome of critically ill patients.","UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT ANAESTHESIOL,DIV SURG INTENS CARE,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND; UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT MED,DIV NEPHROL,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND; UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT MED,DIV MED INTENS CARE,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,10,48,50,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0931-0509,,,NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL,Nephrol.

Recently we have studied the interaction of picosecond and femtosecond laser radiation in the visible region of the spectrum with synthetic polymer films and we have compared these studies with our similar studies nab nanosecond duration laser radiation. Biocompatible polymers have been extensively used for sutures, vascular grafts or bone and other hard tissue replacements. The use of surgical lasers for intervention on biocompatible material - tissue interfaces has attracted a great deal of interest, as both the high intensity, short pulse duration lasers and the prosthetic biomaterials are in increasing use. Our recent ablation studies, using ultrashort laser pulses, of biocompatible materials, are described in this article. Lasers were introduced in medical research in the early sixties but the laser beam ability to remove efficiently and safely soft or hard tissue, the lateral thermal damage and the final surface characteristics are still under investigation In the past few years, pulse mid-infrared lasers have attracted much attention because they operate at wavelengths where soft or hard tissue, try virtue of their water or water and hydroxyapatite content respectively, exhibit strong absorption restricting residual thermal damage to a relatively small zone. Recently we have investigated the interaction of short pulse laser radiation of picosecond and femtosecond duration with soft and hard tissue, as this unexplored field is expected to be a potential alternative in powerful laser processing of biomedical structures.

The material could be used, much as a bone graft, as material itself resorbs or dissolves as bone growth occurs, and end result is new remolded bone. Ca2P2O7 is one of intermediate product of bone mineralized crystal from amorphous calcium phosphates. The Ca2P2O7 doped with certain amount of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was prepared as the developed material. In this study, the Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was used for liquid phase sintering additive which was expected to improve sintering process and promote physiological bioresorbability. Compressive strength and 4-point bending strength were measured by Bionix test system 858. At the beginning, the mechanical strength was proportionally increasing with the addition of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O up to 5 wt%, but thereafter decreased The microstructure and crystalline identification was analyzed by the techniques of SEM, EPMA, TEM and XRD. The relationship between mechanical strength of the sintered bioceramics and Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O dopant was in terms of the presence of NaCa(PO3)(3), grain growth and abnormal grain coalescence while dopant increased. Preliminary in-vivo evaluation was studied by rabbit femur condyle implantation model. There was no inflammation or any toxic sign during the experimental period. The histological section of intraosseous implantation revealed that the new bone directly deposited on the surface of the material at the 4th week after operation. The materials were gradually decreasing in volume and being replaced by the surrounding regenerated bone in the rabbit condyle in-vivo environment. The results was encouraged us to conclude that the developed material did have a great potential as an ideal biodegradable bone substitute.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAIPEI,TAIWAN","Lin, FH (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,CTR BIOMED ENGN,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.",,"Lin, Feng-Huei/E-3970-2010",,,,,25,0,1,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS,CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE,"EINERSBERGER BLICK 28, PO BOX 266, W-3392 CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE, GERMANY",1013-9826,,,KEY ENG MAT,,,1996.0,115,,,,,,191,208,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.115.191,,,,18,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science,BE83H,WOS:A1996BE83H00013,,,,,2019-02-25

However, in the as-cast condition these alloys are relatively brittle due to the precipitation of interdendritic carbide phases, a-phase, and gas porosity. Furthermore, the carbon content has to be kept to a minimum for optimum alloy performance under wear conditions (such as in applications for prosthetic devices). Hence, in this work the effect of carbon content and heat treating on the exhibited mechanical properties was investigated. For this purpose three alloys (0.05, 0.16, and 0.31% C) were fabricated by remelting a commercial ASTM-F75 alloy under an inert environment followed by casting cylindrical bars of 13.5 mm diameter by 250 mm in length. The heat treatments consisted of annealing at 1250 degrees C for four hours followed by furnace cooling and/or water quenching. It was found that the alloy strength is not severely affected by the carbon content. In particular, the 0.05% C alloy exhibits a strain hardening behaviour which suggests an FCC to HCP strain induced martensitic transformation. At higher carbon contents the extent of the transformation is drastically reduced, probably due to the presence of significant second phase precipitates. In addition, relatively slow cooling rates seem to hinder the extent of the strain induced transformation.","CONVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estud Avanzados, Unidad Saltillo, Saltillo 25900, Coahuila, Mexico","Salinas-Rodriguez, A (reprint author), CONVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estud Avanzados, Unidad Saltillo, Km 13 Carr, Saltillo 25900, Coahuila, Mexico.",,,,,,,14,3,3,0,0,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-349-X,,,,1996.0,,,,,,,69,79,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM42Z,WOS:000078691600005,,,,,2019-02-25

Metal replicas make near ideal samples for STM in comparison to the original biological materials. Modifications include a 0.1 mu m backing layer of silver and mounting the replicas on a fine-mesh silver filters to enhance the rigidity of the metal replica. This is required unless STM imaging is carried out in vacuum; otherwise, a liquid film of contamination physically connects the STM tip with the sample. This mechanical coupling leads to exaggerated height measurements; the enhanced rigidity of the thicker replica eliminates much of the height amplification. Further improvement was obtained by imaging in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Calibration and reproducibility were tested with replicas of well characterized bilayers of cadmium arachidate on mica that provide regular 5.5 nm steps. We have used the STM/replica technique to examine the ripple shape and amplitude in the P-beta. phase of dimyristoylphosphatidyl-choline (DMPC) in water. STM images were analyzed using a cross-correlation averaging program to eliminate the effects of noise and the finite size and shapes of the metal grains that make up the replica. The correlation averaging allowed us to develop a composite ripple profile averaged over hundreds of individual ripples and different samples. The STM/replica technique is sufficiently general that it can be used to examine a variety of hydrated lipid and protein samples at a lateral resolution of about 1 nm and a vertical resolution of about 0.3 mn.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Zasadzinski, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gorilla@squid.ucsb.edu,,,,,,128,0,0,0,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INTERNATIONAL,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",,,0-931288-49-5,,,,1996.0,,,,,,,123,148,,,,,,26,Biochemical Research Methods; Microscopy,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Microscopy,BM31Y,WOS:000078376200011,9601535.0,,,,2019-02-25

In general, special surface properties with regard to chemical composition, hydrophilicity, roughness, crystallinity, conductivity, lubricity, and cross-linking density are required for the success of these applications. Polymers very often do not possess the surface properties needed for these applications. However, they have excellent bulk physical and chemical properties, are inexpensive, and are easy to process. For these reasons, surface modification techniques which can transform these inexpensive materials into highly valuable finished products have become an important part of the plastics and many other industries. In recent years, many advances have been made in developing surface treatments to alter the chemical and physical properties of polymer surfaces without affecting bulk properties. Common surface modification techniques include treatments by flame, corona, plasmas, photons, electron beams, ion beams, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Plasma treatment is probably the most versatile surface treatment technique. Different types of gases such as argon, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, carbon dioxide, and water can produce the unique surface properties required by various applications. For example, oxygen-plasma treatment can increase the surface energy of polymers, whereas fluorine-plasma treatment can decrease the surface energy and improve the chemical inertness. Cross-linking at a polymer surface can be introduced by an inert-gas plasma. Modification by plasma treatment is usually confined to the top several hundred angstroms and does not affect the bulk properties. The main disadvantage of this technique is that it requires a vacuum system, which increases the cost of operation. Thin polymer films with unique chemical and physical properties are produced by plasma polymerization. This technology is still in its infancy, and the plasma chemical process is not fully understood. The films are prepared by vapor phase deposition and can be formed on practically any substrate with good adhesion between the film and the substrate. These films, which are usually highly cross-linked and pinhole-free, have very good barrier properties. Such films find great potential in biomaterial applications and in the microelectronics industry. Very high-power microwave-driven mercury lamps are available, and they are used in UV-hardening of photoresist patterns for image stabilization at high temperatures. Other applications of UV irradiation include surface photo-oxidation, increase of hydrophilicity, and photocuring of paintings. Pulsed UV-lasers are used in surface modification in many areas. Pulsed UV-laser irradiation can produce submicron periodic linear and dot patterns on polymer surfaces without photomask. These interference patterns can be used to increase surface roughness of inert polymers for improved adhesion. These images can also be transferred to silicon surfaces by reactive ion etching. Pulsed laser beams can be applied to inert polymer surfaces for increased hydrophilicity and wettability. Polymer surfaces treated by pulsed UV-laser irradiation can be positively or negatively charged to enhance chemical reactivity and processability. Pulsed UV-laser exposures with high fluence give rise to photoablation with a clean wall profile. There are many other practical applications of laser photoablation, including via-hole fabrication, and diamond-film deposition. The present review discusses all these current applications, especially in the biomedical and microelectronics areas.","HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM, KOWLOON, HONG KONG","Chan, CM (reprint author), HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM ENGN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG.",,,,,,,196,335,335,8,204,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-5729,,,SURF SCI REP,Surf.
