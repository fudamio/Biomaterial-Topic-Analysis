The peptides and the fusion proteins have been partitioned in aqueous two-phase systems of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-dextran and Ucon-dextran. The studied model protein was ZZT0, where Z is an engineered domain of domain B of staphylococcal protein A. The specially designed hydrophobic peptides, Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro (T1) and (Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro), (T2), have been inserted into ZZT0, to give the peptide-protein fusions ZZT1 and ZZT2. In the experimental studies it was found that T1 and T2 preferred the PEG phase and even more the Ucon phase over the dextran phase. For T2 the partitioning was more one sided than for T1. For the fusion proteins, ZZT1 and ZZT2, the partitioning was enhanced into the PEG or Ucon rich phase as compared to ZZT0. The effects were lower than expected from independent contributions to the partition coefficient from the protein and the peptides. A heterogeneous lattice model was used to calculate theoretical peptide and protein partition coefficients. The calculations could reproduce the qualitative features of the experimental data. The model results suggest that a part of these experimentally observed effects is due to a depletion zone, i.e. a zone of reduced polymer concentration around the protein. The experimental results indicate a further reduction of the partition coefficient, beyond that predicted by the lattice calculations. A possible folding of the inserted peptide is discussed as a plausible mechanism for this further reduction in the partition coefficient.","LUND UNIV,DEPT BIOCHEM,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN; ROYAL INST TECHNOL,DEPT BIOCHEM & BIOTECHNOL,S-10044 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,34,24,24,4,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0021-9673,,,J CHROMATOGR A,J.

Contact of the patients' blood with the nonendothelial surface of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is responsible for several, potentially harmful systemic reactions. Methods. The patients' response to extracorporeal circulation is reviewed briefly. The interactions between patient and circuit are discussed not only as they relate to blood-material contact, but also from a mechanical and theologic standpoint The theoretic benefits of the newer, more hemocompatible materials are presented, along with a review of published clinical experience with heparinized cardiopulmonary bypass circuits. Results. The response to extracorporeal circulation extends far beyond a simple derangement of hemostasis. This inflammatory response is strongly influenced by the theologic design of the circuit and by the physical and chemical properties of the surface. Heparinized circuits decrease inflammation, but the clinical benefits of this reduction remain unclear, except for extended cardiopulmonary support. The safe use of these circuits requires full heparinization and does not reduce allogeneic transfusions. Conclusions. Clinicians are still in the search of the ideal material and the ideal extracorporeal circuit design. Newer, heparinized materials offer real but limited clinical benefits.","CHU BORDEAUX, INSERM U306, BIOMAT RES UNIT, BORDEAUX, FRANCE; CHU BORDEAUX, DEPT ANESTHESIA, BORDEAUX, FRANCE; UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT ANESTHESIA, MONTREAL HEART INST, MONTREAL, PQ, CANADA",,,,,,,,56,36,38,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0003-4975,1552-6259,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

The protein adsorption was studied by ellipsometry-antibody techniques in situ, and adhering platelets were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-CD 61 antibodies. Adhering platelets were quantified by counting labelled cells in microscopic image fields. The spreading of platelets was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that after 1 min of plasma exposure, fibrinogen, IgG and albumin were detectable with antibodies on both surfaces. The amount of deposited fibrinogen and complement decreased with time on titanium, and the amount of adsorbed anti-high molecular weight kininogen increased. No complement was detected on gold surfaces after plasma incubation, and the antibody binding pattern also remained unchanged after prolonged plasma exposure. The surface-bound platelets were found to spread on the gold but not on titanium surfaces. C1q has been shown to induce the expression of P-selectin, i.e. cause secretion reactions in platelets. In this study secreted platelet-microvesicles were found on gold, but not on the titanium surfaces that bound significant amounts of C1q. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that the mixture of fibrinogen, C1q and kininogens, whilst causing adhesion and aggregation, does not result in the activation and microvesicle secretion of platelets. Platelet activation on biomaterial surfaces thus seems to be governed by the mixture of proteins present on that surface, and no one particular protein need cause a known reaction in platelets as obtained when platelets are exposed only to that particular protein.

Ultrastructurally, the test material was circumscribed with an electron-dense structure, and was immediately adjacent to elongated cyoplasmic processes with intact morphology or collagen fibrils with periodic structures. Furthermore, the mineralization of the extracellular collagenous matrix occurred directly on the surface of the material.

Both the epoxy-fixed and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries showed significant increases in fixation index and denaturation temperature as compared to the fresh one. Additionally, the resistance of porcine arteries against bacterial collagenase in vitro degradation increased significantly after cross-linking with the epoxy compound or glutaraldehyde. The reduction of the tensile strength of the epoxy-fixed artery after bacterial collagenase degradation was more severe than in its glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart. Generally, with increasing pH, temperature or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed porcine arteries increased.

We studied the behaviour of a new type of polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis used for the repair of abdominal wall defects, Dual Mesh(R) (DM), which has two different faces; one face has a porosity between 30 and 60 mu m, while the other is nonporous. In 20 New Zealand White rabbits, a full-thickness (except skin) 7 cm x 5 cm defect was created in the anterior abdominal wall that was repaired with DM. At 14, 30, 60 and 90 days, samples were obtained and studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. An immunohistochemical study was made with antibody anti-rabbit macrophages (RAM-11). Tensile strength was measured with an Instron tensiometer using 2-cm-wide strips obtained parallel to the shorter axis of the implant. DM induced little tissue adhesion to the material on the visceral peritoneum interface and was surrounded by organized repair tissue. The biomaterial was integrated in the repair tissue on the subcutaneous interface, but not on the peritoneal interface. The macrophage response decreased between days 14 and 90 (P < 0.001). Tensile strength increased significantly (P < 0.05) at every study period. We conclude that the DM prosthesis has little tendency to formation of visceral adhesions, the DM prosthesis was well tolerated by the receptor organism and the tensile strength of the prosthesis/receptor tissue interface increased with time.

Into the cellulose membrane, iminodiacetate (IDA) group that acts as a ligand to metal ions was introduced (Cell-IDA membrane), and then Cu2+ ion was immobilized (Cell-IDA-Cu membrane). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and gamma-globulin (B gamma G), which are the major proteins in blood, were adopted as model proteins to be separated. The Cell-IDA-Cu membrane had large adsorption capacity for these proteins despite the low degree of modification. The amounts of proteins adsorbed on the Cell-IDA-Cu membrane increased with increasing pH, and B gamma G was adsorbed more than BSA. High protein recoveries from the Cell-IDA-Cu membrane were obtained. The separation of these proteins was also conducted under the optimum conditions of adsorption and recovery, and B gamma G was concentrated more than BSA although the initial concentration of B gamma G was lower than that of BSA.

Experiments performed during both cooling and heating and with samples of different thermal histories show a broad endothermic feature beginning at ca. 160 K which is barely interrupted by a partial-crystallization exotherm at ca. 250 K. The endothermic features resembled those observed for several simpler hydrated proteins (Biophys. J., 1994, 66, 249; J. Phys. Chem., 1994, 98, 13780), a hydrated crosslinked polymer (J. Phys. Chem., 1990, 94 2689) and a dry interpenetrating network polymer blend (J. Polym. Sci. B, 1992, 32, 683). Their broadness is a result of the closely spaced multiplicity of small but sharp mini-endotherms and has its origin in the onset of different configurational substrates that become available to the protein's structure as the temperature is increased. The remarkable similarity of these features amongst a broad class of materials is a reflection of the predominant role of the intermolecular energy barriers in determining the structural relaxation kinetics. This has been described in terms of a time-dependent potential-energy surface, which represent a hierarchy of molecular and segmental motions. Ice and freeze-concentrated solution coexist at a thermodynamic equilibrium at T < 273 K. Their respective amounts have been measured between 260 and 273 K and formalism based on equilibrium thermodynamics has been developed, and the DSC scans for cooling simulated. This formalism agrees with the data. The temperature variation of the equilibrium constant for the protein-water <-> protein-ice coexistence does not agree with that given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which is a reflection of strong interactions between the water molecules and H-bonding protein segments. The interpretation in terms of the role of protein dynamics in the crystallization of water, and the formalism developed, are general and useful for studies on other complex biomaterials.",,"Johari, GP (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,HAMILTON,ON L8S 4L7,CANADA.",,,,,,,62,33,33,0,1,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK MILTON ROAD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4WF",0956-5000,,,J CHEM SOC FARADAY T,J.

Dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid, which is negatively charged at physiological conditions, was more easily transferred onto the solid substrate in the presence of divalent cations as compared to the zwitterionic phospholipids dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine and its ether analog dihexadecyl-phosphatidylcholine. The structure across the film was characterized by X-ray reflectivity and X-ray diffraction, whereas the in-plane structure was investigated by electron diffraction. X-ray experiments revealed a repeat unit of 5.35 nm for the LB him of phosphatidic acid. A model for the Y-type structure of this film is presented based on a modeling technique of the X-ray reflectivity data. The substructure of the film along the normal to the substrate plane is described in detail using this new approach. Electron diffraction indicated a hexagonal packing of the hydrocarbon chains normal to the substrate surface with a spacing of 0.425 nm. These parameters correlate well with data from bilayer structures. It can be supposed that LB films of acidic phospholipids are useful as membrane mimetic systems. Deposition of the zwitterionic phospholipids was of poor reproducibility, which could be improved in the presence of polymers. A spacing of about 7 nm was deduced for dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine films indicating that the polymer was transferred with the lipid onto the solid support.","RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,INST CRYSTALLOG,MOSCOW 117333,RUSSIA; ZELENOGRAD INST PHYS PROBLEMS,MOSCOW 103460,RUSSIA","Lohner, K (reprint author), AUSTRIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOPHYS & RONTGENSTRUKTURFORSCH,STEYRERGASSE 17-6,A-8010 GRAZ,AUSTRIA.",,"Konovalov, Oleg/C-6702-2019","Konovalov, Oleg/0000-0002-0390-5900",,,,38,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,NOV 15,1996.0,288,1-2,,,,,262,267,,10.1016/S0040-6090(96)08794-9,,,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,VZ205,WOS:A1996VZ20500050,,,,,2019-02-25

Two configurations to sense the binding of an antibody and a lectin to the complementary substrate monolayer are addressed. In one configuration, a fluorescein monolayer was assembled on an Au-electrode and binding of the complementary anti-fluorescein antibody Flc-Ab was followed by the examination of electrode insulation by the antibody towards a solubilized redox probe, Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-). The extent of electrode insulation is controlled by the Flc-Ab concentration in the sample and the electrode responds amperometrically to Flc-Ab concentrations as low as 0.7 mu M. The second configuration applies a redox-modified protein to analyze competitively the protein itself. An Au-electrode was modified by an alpha-D-mannopyranose monolayer, and a bipyridinium-modified concanavalin A was used to analyze concanavalin A (Con. A). Competitive binding of the redox-modified Con. A and the analyzed Con. A to the monolayer-modified electrode occurred, and the amperometric response was inversely proportional to the Con. A concentration. Quartz crystals coated with Au-electrodes were applied for the piezoelectric QCM analyses of Flc-Ab and Con. A. The crystal electrodes are modified with a fluorescein antigen monolayer. The Flc Ab was sensed by the changes in the crystal frequencies as a result of the antibody association to the electrode. Flc-Ab at a concentration as low as 5 ng ml(-1) was detected. The series of monosaccharides alpha-D-mannopyranose, beta-D-glucose or alpha-D-glucose was assembled onto the Au-electrodes of the quartz crystals and used as a sensing interface for concanavalin A.

However, essentially all previously examined topographies bear little relation to cell adhesion substrates found in biological tissues. In vivo, many cells are adherent to extracellular matrices (ECM), which have an extremely complex 3-D topography in the micrometre to nanometre range. In addition, many studies indicate that micro- and nano-scale mechanical stresses generated by cell-matrix adhesion have significant effects on cellular phenotypic behaviour. In this report we describe methodology for the fabrication of topographic replicas of the subendothelial ECM topography with a biomedical polyurethane. Using three-dimensional high resolution scanning electron microscopy, accurate replication of subendothelial ECM topography from the macroscopic to the macromolecular scale is demonstrated. Bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on the ECM replicas spread more rapidly and had a three-dimensional appearance and spread areas at confluence which appeared more like endothelial cells in native arteries, compared with cells cultured on untextured control surfaces. Since the fabrication process may be used with many different types of materials, including polymers of synthetic and biological origin, these biomimetic ECM-textured surfaces may find both research and clinical applications.

In most instances, cells have sloughed off under flow conditions. The performance of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) designed to stabilize patients awaiting donor hearts for transplantation has been remarkably good. After prolonged implantation, pump surfaces become covered with a pannus of smooth muscle-like cells (myofibroblasts). Occasional islands of endothelial cells have been identified on top of such cell layers. Therefore, in an attempt to accelerate the beneficial conditioning and improve biomaterial-blood compatibility of LVAD internal surfaces, their seeding with autologous, genetically engineered smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was investigated. Methods and Results Since routine testing of the Thermo-cardiosystems HeartMate LVAD is carried out in calves, SMCs were isolated from calves, propagated in culture, and transduced with NO synthase genes to yield stable production of NO. Previous studies had demonstrated that SMCs attached strongly to the biomaterials that compose the internal surfaces of LVADs. Transduction of NO synthase gene expression in the SMCs was achieved by electroporation and antibiotic (G418) selection. Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by NO has been documented, and the same molecule has been shown to inhibit platelet adhesion to cell surfaces. Cells transduced with NO synthase expressed enzyme protein at consistently high levels for several passages in culture; however, NO production was dependent on the supplementation of culture medium with a source of tetrahydrobiopterin (sepiapterin). Under such conditions, transduced cells were growth-inhibited compared with mock-transfected controls. Induction of GTP cyclohydrolase (the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of tetrahydrobiopterin) expression also resulted in NO production by NO synthase-transduced cells. Conclusions Preliminary studies have shown that SMCs form strong attachments to the surface materials of LVADs and that their proliferation rates could be controlled after transformation with NO synthase under conditions that support production of NO. Therefore, genetically engineered SMCs may provide an improved blood-biomaterial interface for cardiovascular prostheses.",,"ScottBurden, T (reprint author), TEXAS MED CTR,TEXAS HEART INST,VASC CELL BIOL LAB,POB 20345,HOUSTON,TX 77225, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-53233],,,13,13,13,0,0,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,NOV 1,1996.0,94,9,,S,,,235,238,,,,,,4,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,VP690,WOS:A1996VP69000043,8901752.0,,,,2019-02-25

The authors evaluate whether dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DSA) is a reliable method to determine the density of natural coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) blocks used as bone graft substitutes. METHODS. To evaluate the basic density of HA blocks from the same coral heads with and without titanium meshes, densitometry of 12 HA-500 blocks (genus Goniopora) and 12 HA-200 blocks (genus Porites) was performed. In addition, density measurements of 30 HA blocks (HA-500, n = 15; HA-200, n = 15) from different coral heads were obtained to assess if the originating coral head influences the basic density of blocks within one coral genera. To assess standard deviation serial measurements on eight coralline HA blocks, four with titanium meshes and four without were performed. In the ex vivo study, densitometry of 12 HA blocks (HA-500, n = 4; HA-200, n = 8) used as bone graft substitutes in the mandibles and craniums of adult mongrel dogs was performed. Densities were measured after bone in growth for 2 and 4 months, respectively. All measurements were obtained with a Lunar DPX with scan mode ''slow 750'' in the spine program with the regions-of-interests selected manually. Bone ingrowth was assessed by computer-assisted histomorphometry, which was considered the gold standard. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate the densities of plain HA blocks with and without meshes to the specific weights of the blocks. RESULTS. Significant positive correlation was found between the density of each HA block (both coral species) with and without meshes and the calculated specific weights. Densitometry values showed no significant differences depending on the originating coral heads. Standard deviation ranged between +/-3.8% and +/-4.1% (HA-500) and between +/-3.0% and +/-3.8% (HA-200). Hydroxyapatite-500 blocks showed marked increased densities between 15% and 34% after 4 months in three specimens in which bone ingrowth between 16.9% and 21.1% was revealed by histomorphometry; no increase of density was observed in one specimen, which presented only minimal bone ingrowth and signs of infection. Despite bone invasion between 12% and 25.8%, no increased densities were observed for HA-200 implants. CONCLUSIONS. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is an accurate and reproducible modality to assess the densities of plain coralline HA blocks and to monitor bone ingrowth into coralline HA-500 but not into HA-200 block implants.","VET AFFAIRS MED CTR,DEPT RADIOL,SAN DIEGO,CA 92161; UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SAN DIEGO,CA 92103; UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT PLAST SURG,SAN DIEGO,CA 92103; INTERPORE INT INC,IRWINE,CA",,,,,,,,16,8,8,0,1,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0020-9996,,,INVEST RADIOL,Invest.

The Fluoropassiv(R) mesh, as well as two controls, the Surgipro(TM) polypropylene mesh and the Gore-Tex(R) expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch, were used for the repair of experimentally induced abdominal hernias in piglets and followed for scheduled implantation periods of 4, 15, and 60 days. At the sacrifice the mesh and surrounding tissue were excised for histological assessment of the healing sequence, for the identification of changes in hematologic and immunological characteristics, and for the measurement of the mechanical properties. After cleaning to remove the encroaching tissue, the explanted devices were monitored for biostability by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The present study has demonstrated that the Fluoropassiv(R) mesh provides adequate mechanical strength and compares favorably with the two controls. No exacerbated systemic or in situ hematologic or immunological reactions were observed with either the meshes or the patch material. Histological studies revealed that thick collagenous and vascularized tissue were well anchored to the three biomaterials as early as 15 days after implantation. The degree of tissue penetration differed depending on the device. Chemically, they proved stable over time.

After 4 days, 1 month, and 3 months postimplantation, the tissue reactions and interactions were evaluated by light micros copy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Poly(tetrahydrofuran) (poly(THF)), poly(propylene oxide) (poly(POx)), and poly(tetrahydrofuran-co-oxetane) (poly (THF-co-OX)) were tested as relatively hydrophobic polyethers, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) and a poly(THF)/PEO blend were used as more hydrophilic materials. In general all polyethers showed good biocompatibility with respect to tissue reactions and interactions, with low neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, a quiet giant cell reaction, and formation of a thin fibrous capsule. For the relatively hydrophobic polyethers studied, the biostability increased in the order poly(POx) < poly(THF-co-OX) < poly(THF), probably indicating that the absence of tertiary hydrogen atoms has a positive effect on the biostability. Concerning the more hydrophilic materials, crosslinked PEO showed the highest rate of degradation, probably due to the mechanical weakness of the hydrogel in combination with the highest presence of giant cells as a result of the high porosity. A frayed surface morphology was observed after implantation of the crosslinked poly(THF)/PEO blend, which might be due to preferential degradation of PEO domains.

The HCLs used were 1) PMMA HCL, 2) oxygen-permeable HCL composed of a graft copolymer of dextran derivative and methylmethacrylate (MMA) (Suncon Mild II(TM), 12 Dk), and 3) oxygen-permeable-HCL composed of a copolymer of a monomer containing silicone, a monomer containing fluorine, and MMA (RGPL-A, 216 Dk). Cell injury rates were significantly different among these HCLs (Suncon Mild II(TM) < PMMA < RGPL-A) although there were no differences in rotatory rubbing forces. The smoothness of HCL surface, the qualities of injured cell layers observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the water wettability of HCLs were not correlated with cell injury rate. These results suggest that physicochemical properties of materials other than rotatory rubbing force, smoothness, and water wettability were involved in the cell injury. Our evaluation method for biomaterials that injure the corneal endothelial cells by dynamic contact should be very useful for the development of biomaterials or medical devices, including HCLs and intracardiac and urethral catheters.

Compound 1 can be reacted with other methacrylates, such as methyl methacrylate (MMA), and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with high conversion. Typically, less than 0.5% of free monomer is left after polymerization. For example, compound 1 was reacted with MMA and HEMA in the molar ratio 7:73:20, respectively. This yielded a terpolymer with Tg = 86 degrees C, M(w) = 47,000 g/mol and M(n) = 22,800 g/mol. This material was characterized by various physicochemical techniques, including gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (H-1 at 400 MHz, DMSO-d(6) solution). in addition the material was found to exhibit low surface thrombogenicity in vitro and a low propensity to activate contacting blood platelets. Furthermore it was found that the terpolymer is markedly radiopaque: even thin objects (<0.5 mm) could be easily visualized using X-ray fluoroscopic techniques as are routinely used in the clinic, e.g., during coronary angiography. The combined results obtained with the present terpolymer (particularly its in vitro hemocompatibility and its radiopacity) leads to the suggestion that this type of polymer could be used as cardiovascular biomaterials, for instance for the construction of a new type of endovascular stents. These would be expected to show improved biocompatibility if compared with metallic stents which are currently used, for instance in conjunction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). A stent prototype, constructed from the present radiopaque terpolymer, is shown and discussed briefly. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons.

The experimental difficulties associated with the application of this technique to the study of biological materials include the effects of ultra-high vacuum, x-ray exposure, surface charging, and, for insulating materials, the inherent lack of an intrinsic energy reference. Since most biological materials are insulators, the lack of an intrinsic energy reference complicates one's ability to draw direct comparisons between different studies. In this paper, the results from two different apatites are compared with the results obtained from the use of two conventional techniques for referencing binding energies. The results presented here are referenced only to the Pt Fermi level; no further energy modifications are performed. A comparison with the results of other investigators indicates a large difference in binding energies for all involved core levels. These results indicate that, in the study of insulating materials with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is essential that all data be acquired under exacting conditions on the same experimental system.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH DENT,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108; NYU,DENT CTR,NEW YORK,NY 10010","Wieliczka, DM (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT PHYS,1110 EAST 48TH ST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64110, USA.",,,"Spencer, Paulette/0000-0003-1447-826X","NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09696, DE00260]",,,7,10,10,0,4,AMER ASSOC DENTAL RESEARCH,ALEXANDRIA,"1619 DUKE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314",0022-0345,,,J DENT RES,J.

The purpose of this study was to test percutaneous injectable bone biomaterials with a reproducible model. A closed cancellous bone defect was created in the distal femoral extremities of 34 rabbits. Filling was done by a percutaneous injection made on the medial side, after the defect had been hollowed by a lateral approach. Three situations were tested: unfilled, filled with orthopaedic cement, filled with a soft collagen-hydroxyapatite material. Three time intervals (2, 4 and 8 weeks) were tested for the three situations. For the mixed hydroxyapatite-collagen material, each component was tested separately: the injectable collagen, and the hydroxyapatite powder. The quality of the defect was assessed by the variations of the defect area on sagittal sections. Bone formation in the defect was quantified for each group and time interval. A bone defect of reproducible size was obtained. Evolution of bone formation was different in each group. An unfilled defect was never completely filled by bone and the defect bone formation rate stayed between 9.9% and 15.1% without any statistical difference between the time intervals. The percutaneous injection of orthopaedic cement, which was progressive, was less complete than an opened surgical filling and explained a frequent low peripheral bone formation. A lower bone formation rate was observed in all the filled groups (orthopaedic cement, hydroxyapatite-collagen, hydroxyapatite and collagen) than in the control unfilled group. This study showed the use of bone biomaterials by an injectable percutaneous method, and a model to evaluate these materials is proposed.","CTR HOSP VICTOR PROVO,F-79100 ROUBAIX,FRANCE","Pasquier, G (reprint author), INST CALOT,INST RECH MALAD SQUELETTE,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE.",,,"Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,17,39,39,0,4,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

This study analyzed effects of surface finish and diamond-like carbon coating on osteoblast cell adhesion to polished titanium-aluminum-vanadium and polished or grit-blasted cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys. Osteoblast binding was tested in the presence and absence of the cell adhesion proteins fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin and was quantified by measurement of DNA content. Although adherence occurred in serum-free medium, maximal osteoblast binding required serum and was similar for titanium and cobalt alloys at 2 and 12 hours. With the grit-blasted cobalt alloy, cell binding was reduced 48% (p < 0.05) by 24 hours. Coating the alloys with diamond-like carbon did not alter osteoblast adhesion, whereas fibronectin pretreatment increased cell binding 2.6-fold (p < 0.05). In contrast, fibrinogen, vitronectin: and laminin did not enhance cell adhesion. These results support the hypothesis that cell adhesion proteins can modify cell binding to orthopaedic alloys. Although osteoblast binding was not affected by the presence of diamond-like carbon, this coating substance may influence other longer term processes, such as bone formation, and deserves further study.","STANFORD UNIV,MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT FUNCT RESTORAT,ORTHOPAED RES LAB,STANFORD,CA 94305; STANFORD UNIV,SCH ENGN,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305; WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ST LOUIS,MO",,,,,,,,40,41,43,1,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

The SNOM/AFM system contains a photon counting system and polychrometer/ICCD (intensified charge coupled device) system for observation of the fluorescence image and spectrograph of micro areas, respectively. The gene coding to green fluorescence protein (GFP) was cloned in recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli). Topography, fluorescence image and spectrograph of recombinant E. coli by SNOM/AFM showed a difference in fluorescence in individual E. coli. Fluorescence activity of GFP can thus be used as a convenient indicator of transformation.

The effect of changing various parameters on the nature of the coating was ascertained including constant current and constant voltage conditions, temperature, supersaturation and electrode spacing. The resultant coatings were characterised using electron microscopical and X-ray diffraction techniques. The mechanical properties were tested using a microhardness indentation technique, the results from which were used to give some indication of the strength and adhesion of the coatings. A model has been proposed to explain the observed phenomena in the precipitation and deposition processes. Amorphous calcium phosphate forms initially in the form of spheres. These spheres coalesce to form gel-like sheets in which hydroxyapatite nucleates. The gel sheets are attracted electrophoretically to the cathode where they are deposited as cells. Each cell wall comprises a number of 100 nm sized crystals oriented with their c-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT MAT, OXFORD OX1 3PH, ENGLAND",,,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771",,,,16,17,17,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,OCT 30,1996.0,287,1-2,,,,,174,183,,10.1016/S0040-6090(96)08755-X,,,,10,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,VY504,WOS:A1996VY50400028,,,,,2019-02-25

We are using this method of surface modification in our search for artificial surfaces with optimized blood compatibility. As a part of this work, two pivotal questions are now addressed: (i) what is the surface density of coupled molecules that can be reached by this method and (ii) is binding to the surface really covalent? After the photochemical coupling of 2 to a PEU surface, the ester bonds of the coupled molecules were selectively hydrolyzed with 0.1 M NaOMe/MeOH and the concentration of fluorescent molecules in solution determined spectrofluorometrically. Since not all of the fluorescent molecules were removed by this procedure, an additional experiment was performed (in which the polymer was completely dissolved). It was found that 25 nmol/cm(2) had coupled to the outermost polymer layers and 7.7 nmol/cm(2) to polymer layers more within the material (unreachable for the NaOMe/MeOH reagent). In another experiment a modified PEU sheet was dissolved in THF, after which MeOH was added to precipitate it again. From the fact that no fluorescence was detected in solution it could be concluded that all of the fluorescent molecules were indeed covalently coupled to the polymer surface.","MAASTRICHT UNIV,CTR BIOMAT RES,NL-6200 MD MAASTRICHT,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,28,14,14,1,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,OCT 21,1996.0,29,22,,,,,7012,7015,,10.1021/ma960279x,,,,4,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,VN888,WOS:A1996VN88800007,,,,,2019-02-25

The experimental partitioning behavior of several hydrophilic proteins, including cytochrome c, soybean trypsin inhibitor, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, and catalase, in two-phase aqueous C(10)E(4) and C-8-lecithin micellar systems is reviewed. A theoretical formulation of the protein partitioning behavior, based on a description of excluded-volume interactions between the hydrophilic proteins and the micelles, is also reviewed. The theoretically predicted protein partitioning behavior is compared with that observed experimentally and is found to be in good agreement. The results of our investigation suggest that two-phase aqueous micellar systems of the type examined in this article are indeed potentially useful as extractant phases for the separation or concentration of proteins and other biomaterials.

Explants surrounded by tissue are often fixed in formalin or glutaraldehyde to facilitate later pathological and histological analysis, but the subsequent removal of such fixed tissue from thermally sensitive and less chemically stable polymers, such as polyurethanes, poses major problems for the materials scientist, who does not wish to modify the chemical, physical or morphological characteristics of the underlying biomaterial. The present study has attempted to find a solution to this problem by exposing virgin specimens of the microporous polyurethane Vascugraft(R) vascular prosthesis to six different cleaning conditions, all known to be effective in removing fixed tissue. These conditions included the use of 20% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution for 48 h at room temperature, 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for 5 min at the boil, and 9, 10, 11 and 12 N hydrochloric acid for 48 h at room temperature. The appearance and chemical properties of the virgin and treated specimens were compared using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography for molecular weight and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. The use of temperatures close to the boil resulted in the formation of a translucent, rubbery material with gross changes in the microporous and microfibrous structure. The strongly acidic and alkaline conditions caused a loss in the surface carbonate group content. In addition, 12 N hydrochloric acid reduced the molecular weight and urethane content. Consequently, 9 N hydrochloric acid is recommended as the cleaning agent of choice for removing fixed tissue from this type of microporous polyurethane. Control experiments on virgin material should also be included in any cleaning protocol.

We have demonstrated that the rate of cross-linking in glutaraldehyde and epoxide homobifunctional reagents can be modulated by uniaxial stress (strain). Two poly(glycidyl ether) epoxides were used: Denacol(R) EX-810 (a small bifunctional reagent), and Denacol EX-512 (a large polyfunctional reagent). To prevent any possible effect from being masked by saturation of cross-linking sites, bovine pericardium was cross-linked to such an extent that the increase in collagen denaturation temperature, T-d, was one-half of the maximal rise achievable with each reagent. Uniaxial tensile stress of 0, 15, 124 or 233 kPa was applied during cross-linking. Cross-linking rate (as observed by increase in T-d) increased with increasing stress to a maximum at 124 kPa in glutaraldehyde at pH 7 but decreased in EX-810 at pH 7. In each case, the effect was small but statistically significant. No effect was observed with the larger EX-512. Cross-linking under increasing stress also showed systematic effects on mechanical properties: decreasing extensibility and plastic strain while increasing tensile strength. In each case, the effects of the epoxides were slightly different from those of glutaraldehyde. In preparation for the above experiments, studies of the effect of pH, temperature, and exposure time were carried out for each epoxide and (to a lesser extent) for glutaraldehyde. Again, systematic changes in mechanical properties were observed with increasing T-d. Conformational changes in collagen produced by mechanical stress (strain) modulate the rate of cross-linking and the resulting mechanical properties; however, the effects are sensitive to the reagent employed.

The results indicate that the tissue's shrinkage temperature behaviour is retained. The tissues do not appear to have been affected by surface layering with polypyrrole or poly(sodium 3-pyrrolyl-butanesulphonate) (PSPBS). The main influence on the shrinkage temperature appears to be the reaction conditions in producing the hybrids i.e. the solvent and the presence of FeCl3. Hybrids obtained from reactions where the solvent was acetic acid demonstrated irreversible denaturation giving a final lower shrinkage temperature than the original value. Ail tissues exposed to FeCl3 were found to have higher shrinkage temperatures. This has been attributed to transient coordination bonding between the metal ion and side groups on the amino acid. The single peak of PSPBS-tissue hybrids in acetic acid is probably associated with the effective penetration of the PSPBS into the tissue, permitting some interaction between the functionalities of the conducting polymer and collagen.

In the case of the agar diffusion test survival of cells is involved in the presence of the material to be tested. Further statements on the biological effects of a biomaterial require the use of cell cultures adapted to the tissue concerned and the underlying problem being investigated. In the present study, an osteoblast cell culture system with which implant surfaces in contact with bone can be tested as required by the relevant standards is described. Test bodies made of titanium, polystyrene or copper were used in the conventional agar diffusion test, and were also overgrown with fibroblasts or a cell line of foetal human osteoblasts. For the agar diffusion test, the test criterion was the extent of the inhibition area on staining with neutral red, while for the overgrowth, the mean cell diameter and the number of cells was employed. The phenotype of the osteoblast cell line was determined immunohistochemically by means of alkali ne phosphatase or immunohistologically by means of collagen I and osteocalcin. Calcification was demonstrated using the v. Kossa stain. In the case of the osteoblasts, a differentiation of a collagen I and alkaline phosphatase-positive phenotype over an osteocalcin-positive phenotype to an increase in calcium deposition was shown. As in the case of the agar diffusion test, direct overgrowth also revealed no cytotoxic effect for titanium and polystyrene. In contrast, a cytotoxic effect consisting in a decrease in the number of cells and also a left shift in the size distribution was observed for copper. The standard deviations of the individual tests were less for overgrowth than for the agar diffusion test. The culture system for osteoblast cells thus meets the criteria of the EN/DIN 30993-5 in terms of the quality and accuracy of the results obtained. In addition to excluding direct cytotoxicity, this test system offers a new possibility of examining the influence of the material on cell growth. Consequently, it permits a repeatable examination of proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts on each material surface.","UNIV WURZBURG,LEHRSTUHL EXPT ZAHNMED,WURZBURG,GERMANY","Hendrich, C (reprint author), UNIV WURZBURG,ORTHOPAD KLIN,KONIG LUDWIG HAUS,BRETTREICHSTR 11,D-97074 WURZBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,,,15,11,11,0,5,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

We and others have provided evidence that direct interaction, an interaction that we believe is essential for the stabilization, between the sugar and polar groups in, for example, proteins and phospholipids occurs in the dry state. Some researchers, however, have suggested that the ability of the sugar to form a glass is the only requirement for stabilization. More recently, we have shown that both glass formation and direct interaction of the sugar and headgroup are often required for stabilization. In the present study, we present a state diagram for trehalose glass and suggest that the efficacy of this sugar for stabilization may be related to its higher glass transition temperatures at all water contents. We also show that trehalose and trehalose:liposome preparations form trehalose dihydrate as well as trehalose glass when rehydrated with water vapor. Formation of the dihydrate sequesters water, which might otherwise participate in lowering the glass transition temperature to below ambient.

Bacterial biofilms were produced in the modified Bobbins device using continuous culture flow at 60 ml/h for 40-44 h, and the sessile organisms were then exposed to either ciprofloxacin or tobramycin at a range of concentrations for 12 or 36h. The BEC of ciprofloxacin was 5 mu g/ml for the 12 and 36 h treatments, a value 10 x greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). In contrast, the BEC of tobramycin was >100 mu g/ml after 12h and 75 mu g/ml following 36 h of drug exposure, that is 75-100 x the MIC and MBC. The results demonstrated that the BEC is a more suitable indicator of the antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms than the MIC and MBC. Ciprofloxacin was significantly more effective than tqbramycin in the treatment of P. aeruginosa adherent to biomaterials. With respect to clinical application, if the intention of antibiotic use is to eradicate bacteria adherent to devices, only biofilm-active agents should be used.

This approach may be useful for enhancing the fixation of orthopedic implants. p-Nitrophenyl chloroformate (p-NPC) was used to immobilize protein on bulk samples of Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. Activation of both materials was dependent on the concentration of p-NPC, with a maximum of approximately 1.5 active groups/nm(2) of nominal surface area. Trypsin was used as a model protein because much is known about its structure and mode of action. Derivatization with 0.65 mg p-NPC/cm(2) resulted in significantly greater enzymatic activity (7.4 BAEE [N-(alpha)-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester hydrochloride] units) on the Co-Cr-Mo samples compared with higher concentrations of p-NPC (5 BAEE units) and with simple adsorption of trypsin (1.5 BAEE units). An activity of 10.5 BAEE units was measured on both adsorbed and p-NPC-activated Ti-6Al-4V, with the exception of samples derivatized with 1.95 mg p-NPC/cm(2), on which activity was significantly lower (4 BAEE units). In probing the linkages between trypsin and biomaterial by treatment with chaotropic agents, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was observed to eliminate more enzymatic activity than was urea. On Co-Cr-Mo samples, GuHCl removed nearly all the trypsin activity, while urea significantly decreased the activity only at a concentration of 0.65 mg r-NPC/cm(2). Treatment of Ti-6Al-4V samples with GuHCl caused a trend of decreasing activity with increasing concentration of p-NPC, whereas urea had no effect on immobilized trypsin activity.

We evaluated the biocompatibility of Nitinol screws using immunohistochemistry to observe the distribution of bone proteins during bone remodeling process around NiTi implant. Results were compared with screws made of Vitallium, c.p. titanium, Duplex austenitic-ferritic stainless steel (SAF), and Stainless Steel 316L. Screws were implanted in rabbit tibia for 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Embedding was performed in the hard resin Technovit, and for the immunohistochemical procedure undecalcified sections with bone-anchored implants could thus be used. The immunostaining method developed seemed to be a reliable technique to stain proteins in undecalcified sections. Biocompatibility results of the NiTi screws compared with the other screws showed a slower osteogenesis process characterized by no close contact between implant and bone, disorganized migration of osteoblasts around the implant, and a lower activity of osteonectin synthesis.

Flat patches made of different biomaterials have been used in textile or microporous forms. The present work describes the results of an in vitro study comparing the morphological, mechanical, and chemical characteristics of a new textile prototype, Fluoropassiv(R), made of polyester fibers treated with a fluoropolymer and impregnated with gelatin to those of seven existing commercial meshes and patches made from polypropylene, polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) yams, and expanded microporous PTFE graft. The morphological study revealed a diversity of structures having a minimal relative porosity of 70%, high bursting, and suture retention strengths in comparison with natural muscular tissue. Elasticmoduli proved to depend more on the direction of the textile: the rigidity was higher for those materials having tight structure, like the Fluoropassiv(R) and the Surgipro(TM) meshes (>30 MPa), whereas those with more open structures, such as the Marlex(R), Trelex(R), Lars(R), Bard Teflon(R), and GoreTex(R) structures, showed lower elastic modulus (10 mPa). In addition, chemical analyses confirmed no irregularities in the polymers used in all prostheses and demonstrated that the fluoropolymer coating of the Fluoropassiv(R) was uniformly distributed. The innovative aspects in the construction of the knitted fabric Fluoropassiv(R) appears to make it suitable for repairing hernias, and the inclusion of both continuous fluoropolymer surface treatment of polyester fibers and gelatin impregnation appears to improve the healing process.

Glass slides were coated with polyorthoester, poly(L-lactic acid), and polysulfone, and inserted into a laminar flow cell to expose them to bacterial cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli. The free energy of adhesion (Delta F-adh) was determined from contact-angle measurements. The microscopic observations along with the mathematical model allowed measurement of the rates of adhesion, release, and growth. The growth rate of P. aeruginosa on the various surd aces correlated to the Delta F-adh. The growth rates of all species on all of the surfaces were slower than the growth rates of the bacteria in suspension. The mathematical model is valid for early growth before the bacteria form a complete monolayer, and is useful in predicting and modeling early growth of bacteria on implanted biomaterials.

All of the assays investigated showed a highly significant ''edge'' effect when within-plate reproducibility was examined; between-plate reproducibility was good for all assays except the MTT assay. When the assays were tested on cells adherent on biomaterials, there was a wide variation in the results obtained; in particular, the MTS assay showed poor reproducibility in the presence of materials. The MTT and BrdU assays both showed sufficient precision to detect cells on two of the materials studied.

Three surfaces known to be difficult to evaluate were chosen to be measured on the same area with the two instruments. The measurements from the optical and the contact stylus profilometer were compared with each other and with measurements obtained from high-resolution atomic force microscopy, which served as a reference instrument. Six implants manufactured from commonly used biomaterials were also measured on the same part of the implant, but not on the same area, with the optical and the contact profilometer in order to stimulate the measurements that would be performed wizen different laboratories measure similarly treated surfaces. The numerical and visual differences achieved when measuring the same area with the two instruments investigated were compared. In general, we found an underestimation of the surface features with the contact stylus measurement and an overestimation with the confocal scanner The stylus readings are mainly influenced by the radius of the stylus tip, the pressure of the stylus tip on the surface, and the hardness of the material the optical profilometer has a tendency for creating spikes when surfaces with deep slopes are measured. For relatively soft metallic biomaterials, we found that using the optical instrument is the most appropriate method for surface roughness characterization, particularly when screw-shaped implants are analysed, whereas the stylus is preferred when larger areas with substantial slopes within the surface structure are to be evaluated.

Different types of samples were produced by conventional and shear-controlled injection molding (Scorin) and tested under tensile and impact loading. The behavior of three distinct grades is discussed in terms of the respective fracture morphology (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy). A comparison is made between the behavior of conventional and Scorim samples. The results show that the mechanical properties of the materials used were significantly improved by the employment of the Scorim process. The stiffness values of the conventional moldings were doubled, without reducing the ductility of the polymer. The impact data showed a material sensitivity, and consequent loss of properties, to the localized shear imposed to the melt during processing. This situation is attributed to very narrow mold gates (in the case of pingated systems) and leads to much reduced impact performance.","FEUP, DEPT MET ENGN, P-4099 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; INST BIOMED ENGN, INEB, P-4050 OPORTO, PORTUGAL; UNIV MINHO, DEPT POLYMER ENGN, P-4800 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL; BRUNEL UNIV, WOLFSON CTR MAT PROC, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND",,,"Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008; Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012","Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Cunha M., Antonio/0000-0003-3860-7732",,,,13,64,66,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1042-7147,,,POLYM ADVAN TECHNOL,Polym.

However, the mechanism of this in vivo platelet adhesion has yet to be studied extensively. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a practical assay method for assessing platelet adhesion under flow conditions. We have devised an assay method (the fluorescent adhesion assay) that is based on the technique originally reported by Hubbell and McIntire (Biomaterials 7:354, 1986) with some modifications to make it more amenable for assaying small samples and have developed an analysis method to quantify the extent of platelet adhesion and aggregation from fluorescence images by using a computer-assisted image analysis system. In our assay, platelet adhesion, expressed as the percentage of the area covered by adhered platelets, was found to increase biphasically as a function of time. In the first phase, platelets interacted with the coated collagen, transiently stopping on the surface; we called this reaction the temporary arrest. In the second phase. platelets adhered much more rapidly and permanently on the surface, and this adhesion was dependent on the shear rate; platelets formed aggregates in this phase. We used our assay to analyze the effects of platelet aggregation inhibitors on platelet adhesion. All three examined inhibitors, EDTA (10 mmol/L), antiglycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, and GRGDS peptide (1 mmol/L), inhibited the second phase adhesion in flowing blood. Furthermore, GPVI-deficient platelets also showed defective second-phase adhesion under the same conditions. These results suggested that GPIIb/IIIa activation and GPVI contribute to the reaction inducing the second phase. The second-phase adhesion has been extensively investigated, and the consensus is that this reaction is mainly attributable to the platelet-platelet interaction.

This study was conducted to investigate the impact of the preservation method of bioprosthetic heart valve materials on calcification rates and biocompatibility of the biologic tissue. Methods. In subcutaneous rat implants, conventionally preserved bioprosthetic heart valve material was compared with bovine pericardium that was treated with L-glutamic acid to reduce residual glutaraldehyde released from the fixed tissue. Both these methods were compared with bovine pericardium that was stabilized by a dye-mediated photooxidation reaction without glutaraldehyde. Biocompatibility of these biomaterials was tested in vitro using human endothelial cell cultures. Results. Conventionally preserved bovine pericardium with a high amount of glutaraldehyde incorporated into the tissue resulted in severe calcification 63 days after subcutaneous implantation in rats (165.4 +/- 20 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). postfixation treatment with L-glutamic acid, which reduces free, unbound aldehyde groups, showed a significant decrease in calcification (89.6 +/- 14 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). Glutaraldehyde-free preservation by dye-mediated photooxidation showed no calcification after 63 days of subcutaneous implantation (1.0 +/- 0.4 mg Ca2+/g dry weight). Regular endothelial cell proliferation was observed on photooxidized and L-glutamic acid-treated tissue, whereas conventionally treated tissue caused endothelial cell death. Conclusions. This study underlines the detrimental role of glutaraldehyde in the calcification process of bioprosthetic heart valve materials and emphasizes alternative preservation methods that reduce or avoid the use of glutaraldehyde.","UNIV VIENNA,ZENTRUM BIOMED FORSCH,VIENNA,AUSTRIA; VET UNIV VIENNA,INST HISTOL & EMBRYOL,A-1030 VIENNA,AUSTRIA","Grabenwoger, M (reprint author), UNIV VIENNA,DEPT CARDIOTHORAC SURG,WAHRINGER GURTEL 18-20,A-1090 VIENNA,AUSTRIA.",,,"Windberger, Ursula/0000-0002-5800-9089",,,,22,56,60,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0003-4975,,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

Four pairs of grafts were explanted 1 hr after implantation, and the remaining four pairs were explanted 7 days after implantation. Patency was assessed macroscopically, and the grafts were examined microscopically. The anti thrombogenicity of the vascular prostheses heparinized by thermal cross-linking was good in comparison with that of the control group. However, on the outer surface of the grafts, the author found more infiltration of fibroblasts into the wall of the control grafts than in the heparinized grafts. The author surmised that heparinized gelatin injected into the interfibril space of the graft inhibited cellular infiltration. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was slight in both grafts. Thus, the author was successful in heparinizing the vascular prostheses by thermal cross-linking and obtaining slow release of heparin to maintain early antithrombogenicity. The high concentration of heparin in the graft wall, however, was thought to be an obstacle to integration of the vascular prostheses.",,"Iwai, Y (reprint author), YOKOHAMA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT SURG 1,KANAZAWA KU,3-9 FUKUURA,YOKOHAMA,KANAGAWA 236,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,3,3,0,1,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,SEP-OCT,1996.0,42,5,,,,,M693,M697,,10.1097/00002480-199609000-00076,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,VP508,WOS:A1996VP50800075,8944969.0,,,,2019-02-25

A lysosomal marker was used to assess the incidence of infiltrating extracellular matrix degrading cells. The major biochemical features that were associated with tissue degeneration and bioprosthetic heart valve failure were increased levels of MMP 9, high levels of beta-glucuronidase, and constant levels of active collagenase and MMP 2. The MMPs extracted from ruptured bioprostheses were inhibited by calcium chelators and zinc binding compounds. These data suggest that tissue failure, in addition to known mechanical and calcification related factors, may be contributed to by the intervention of proteolytic enzymes.

The release from the implants and the tissue distribution of implanted GFs were determined in vivo using radiolabelled FGF-2. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of capillaries present in each Dacron(R) histological serial section. Radiolabelled GF was rapidly released from matrices and was absent from them by day 28. A very low percentage of the implanted radiolabelled GFs was found in the kidneys and livers of the animals. The number of microvessels formed within fibrin-impregnated samples was increased in the presence of HA and EGGS at 14d and of FN and EGGS or FGF-2 at 28d. FGF-1 had no direct effect on angiogenesis in our model. These results indicate that. enhancement of vascularization within prosthesis mesh may be achieved by using fibrin as a support for angiogenic molecules such as HA, FN and FGFs.

Previous studies have shown that biomaterials can activate macrophages to produce cytokines and promote an inflammatory response. Although the toxicity of many metal ions has been extensively investigated, little is known about the ability of these ions to alter cytokine release from macrophages. Yet the release of these ions from biomaterials has been well documented. Previous studies indicated that alterations in cytokine release might be expected because metal ions alter protein production in macrophages at sub-toxic concentrations. Thus, the hypothesis of this study was that metal ions can alter the secretion of cytokines from macrophages at sub-toxic concentrations. Methods. The release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from macrophages was investigated when the macrophages were exposed to metal ions, with or without lipopolysac charide (LPS), a component of dental plaque. Human THP-1 macrophages were exposed to ions of Ag, Au, Cu, Hg, and Ni for 24 h. In half of the cultures, LPS was added for the last 4 h. The release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha into the medium was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison intervals were used to compare the various experimental conditions. Results. None of the metal ions elevated the IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha levels after 24 h, but Ni ions significantly elevated the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels after 72 h. With LPS added, Ag, Cu, and Ni significantly amplified the LPS-induced production of IL-1 beta but only Ni amplified the TNF-alpha response. These alterations in cytokine response occurred with metal ion concentrations which have been previously shown to be released from dental alloys in vitro and in vivo. Significance. it appeared plausible that macrophage-cytokine mediated inflammatory responses may be altered by the presence of some metal ions in tissues, particularly Ni.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL SURG & MED,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","Wataha, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,35,50,53,0,4,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

Our approach makes use of the McMillan-Mayer solution theory to construct a Gibbs free energy model of the solution. This approach has the following desirable features: (i) the molecular structures of the solute species as well as their interactions are explicit inputs, and, therefore, the application of the theory is not restricted to a particular system, and (ii) the accuracy of the theory can be systematically improved, since the various approximations involved in constructing the solution Gibbs free energy model are clearly delineated. We illustrate the practical implementation of the theoretical framework by examining three cases. First, the theory is utilized in the context of a truncated virial expansion in solution concentration to derive an expression for the solute partition coefficient. Second, the theory is utilized to model protein partitioning in two-phase aqueous surfactant solutions. Third, the theory is utilized to qualitatively predict the partitioning behavior of proteins in a model two-phase aqueous polymer solution, accounting explicitly for the semidilute nature of the concentrated polymer solution phase, We find that the theory captures many of the salient experimental trends observed in protein partitioning in two-phase aqueous polymer solutions.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA; MIT, CTR MAT SCI & ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,"Lue, Leo/E-7846-2011","Lue, Leo/0000-0002-4826-5337",,,,41,22,22,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

To address the deficiencies with the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue, a new fixative, epoxy compound, was used to fix biological prostheses, The study was undertaken to investigate the fixation rates and crosslinking densities of biological tissues fixed with various epoxy compounds. These epoxy compounds are different in their chemical structures, Glutaraldehyde was used as a control, The fixation rates and crosslinking densities of the fixed tissues were determined by measuring their fixation indices and denaturation temperatures, respectively. Generally, the epoxy-fixed tissues were more pliable than the glutaraldehyde-fixed one. Furthermore, the tissues fixed with monofunctional epoxy compound were more pliable than those fixed with multifunctional epoxy compounds. With increasing pH or temperature, the fixation rate of epoxy compound increased, However, the number of epoxide functional groups did not seem to affect the fixation rate of the epoxy compound. The fixation rate of glutaraldehyde was faster than that of epoxy compounds, Additionally, the crosslinking density of the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue was greater than that of the epoxy-fixed counterparts, Moreover, it was noted that the denaturation temperatures of the tissues fixed with glutaraldehyde or multifunctional epoxy compounds were significantly higher than the fresh ones (p <0.05), while that fixed with monofunctional epoxy compound stayed roughly the same throughout the entire fixation process (p >0.05). The results obtained in this study may be used to optimize the fixation process for developing bioprostheses fixed with epoxy compounds.

In this study, the activation of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by the products from a rabbit synovial cell line (HIG-82) stimulated by various particles was investigated using rabbit unfractionated bone cells cultured on a dentin slice. The HIG cells were challenged with the following laboratory-made particles: high-density polyethylene (PE), cobalt alloy (Co-Cr), titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), pure titanium (Ti), and sintered hydroxyapatite (HA). The size of each particle was <2 mu m. The supernatants from HIG cells cultured with the appropriate concentration of wear particles were added to unfractionated bone cells on a dentin slice, and then resorbed areas were determined for each particle. Interestingly, resorbed areas significantly increased only when the culture medium from HIG cells with PE particles was added to unfractionated bone cells. This study demonstrates that PE particles stimulate the rabbit synovial cells to produce soluble factors that induce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Moreover, this experimental model is a useful method sensitively to evaluate the effects of soluble factors from the cells stimulated by particulate biomaterials from joint prostheses on osteoclastic bone resorption.

Monocytes showed a higher propensity for adhesion than did neutrophils under shear and static conditions. Under static conditions, adherent cells on the Santowhite(R)-containing polyurethane had a slightly more activated morphology than those on the base polyurethane. Cell adhesion under shear stress was significantly decreased when C3 or fibronectin was depleted from the suspension medium. Santowhite(R) additive increased Factor B adsorption to the test surface while shear stress increased Factor H adsorption. The combination of Santowhite(R) additive and shear stress increased the adsorption of both Factor B and Factor H and the serum protein S-terminal complement complex levels, but it did not further increase the state of activation of adherent cells. We conclude the leukocyte adhesion on poly(etherurethane urea) surfaces is sensitive to the levels of shear stress and that both C3 and fibronectin are required to maintain adhesion in the presence of shear stress. The low state of cellular activation and increased Factor H adsorption may explain the decreased adherent leukocyte density on the Santowhite(R)-containing polyurethane.

Chemical composition and structure, the presence of contamination, segregation of elements and molecules, microdomain distribution, functional group orientation and molecular mobility at the top layer of a biomaterial strongly influence its biological response and determine its long-term performances. The understanding of surfaces, however, is an intrinsically complex issue which needs to be addressed by many independent physical and chemical investigations. Several methods are available today for the characterization of surfaces, each possessing different potential and complementary characteristics. The present paper reviews some recent applications of surface analysis of polymeric biomaterials. In this particular field XPS and SIMS have been far more widely employed than other surface techniques. The subject matter has been confined to a few representative classes of biopolymers: polyurethanes, polymethacrylates, polyethylene and some miscellanea.

Methods: Discs of test materials were glued to specially designed plastic (Delrin(R)) buttons and implanted into the superior and inferior venae cavae of sheep through a right thoracotomy. The button and disc had such configuration that the blood flow was minimally disturbed. Up to four different materials could be tested simultaneously in each animal: two in superior vena cava and two in inferior vena cava. The materials and their respective implantation sites were changed between different animals according to the Latin square principle. Ten animals were used. Three materials currently used in mechanical heart valve prostheses - titanium, cobalt-chromium alloy (Haynes 25(R)) and pyrolytic carbon (Pyrolite(R) - together with a surface modified (methylated) titanium were evaluated. No heparin was given during the experiment. After two hours of testing, the discs were explanted and evaluated for hemocampatibility. The thrombus area on each disc was measured with photography and planimetry. Platelet and leukocyte adhesion on the surfaces were quantitatively assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that there were significant differences in thrombus formation (p = 0.001) and leukocyte adhesion (p = 0.002) between the materials tested. There was no difference between implantation sites bur significant differences between individual animals (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results indicate that the method can be used to evaluate early hemocompatibility of biomaterials.","LINKOPING UNIV HOSP,DEPT CARDIOTHORAC SURG,LINKOPING HEART CTR,S-58185 LINKOPING,SWEDEN; LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT PHYS & MEASUREMENT TECHNOL,S-58183 LINKOPING,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,4,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD, ENGLAND HA6 2ET",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

The authors have compared the effects of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and glutaraldehyde (the de facto industrial standard crosslinker) on the hydrothermal, biochemical, and uniaxial mechanical properties of bovine pericardium. EDC crosslinking was optimized for maximum increase in collagen denaturation temperature using variables of pH, concentration, and ratio of EDC to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS): a reagent for formation of activated esters. EDC and glutaraldehyde crosslinked materials were subjected to hydrothermal denaturation tests, biochemical degradation by enzymes (collagenase, trypsin) and CNBr, amino acid analysis for unreacted lysine, and to high strain rate mechanical tests including: large deformation stress-strain studies (0.1 to 10 Hz), stress relaxation experiments (loading time 0.1 s) and small deformation forced vibration (1 and 10 Hz). A protocol for EDC crosslinking was developed which used 1.15% EDC (2:1 EDC:NHS) at pH 5.5 for 24 h. The increase in denaturation temperature for EDC (from 69.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C to 86.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C) was equivalent to that produced by glutaraldehyde (85.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C). Both treatments equivalently increased resistance to collagenase and CNBr degradation; however, after denaturation, the EDC-treated tissue was slightly more resistant to collagenase, and markedly more resistant to trypsin. EDC-treated materials were more extensible and more elastic than glutaraldehyde-treated materials. Despite the differences in crosslinking mechanism, EDC and glutaraldehyde-treated materials are very similar.

This study examines the spinal fusion enhancement potential of some osteoconductive and osteoinductive biomaterials. METHODS: Four similar canines received unilateral posterolateral fusions on the left side at T13-L1 and L4-L5 and on the right side at L2-L3 and L6-L7. The experiments were grouped as follows: Group A, autogenous bone harvested from the iliac crest; Group B, autogenous bone and collagen; Group C, no implant; and Group D, autogenous bone, collagen, and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2. Radiographic assessment, three-dimensional computed tomographic volumetric analysis, and biomechanical testing were performed at each level. RESULTS: For Groups A and B, the fusions demonstrated moderate bone formation at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Group D fusions exhibited earlier and more dramatic increases in volume and radiodensity and eventually were comparable in size to the vertebral bodies. Average fusion volumes computed from three-dimensional computed tomographic analysis were: Group A = 1.243 cc, Group B = 0.900 cc, Group C = 0.000 cc, and Group D = 6.668 cc (P = 0.003 compared to Group A). Group D exhibited flexion and extension biomechanical properties much greater than controls. The addition of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 consistently yielded the strongest fused segments and, on average, enhanced extension stiffness by 626% and flexion stiffness by 1120% over controls. CONCLUSION: The most advantageous spinal fusion implant matrix consisted of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2, autogenous bone, and collagen.

(1994) ACS Symp. Ser. 567, 134-147]. Preferentially excluded solutes are also known to stabilize quaternary structure, which enhances the thermostability of multimeric proteins in aqueous systems. Also, it has been suggested that retention of quaternary structure may play a role in the protection of multimeric proteins by polymers during freeze-drying (lyophilization). Although preferential solute exclusion cannot occur in the absence of water, we reasoned that polymers could protect multimeric proteins during freeze-drying by stabilizing quaternary structure in the frozen state. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis and demonstrate that bovine serum albumin and polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilize lactate dehydrogenase by inhibiting dissociation in the frozen solution, during the initial phase of the sublimation step of lyophilization. Dissociation at this critical step correlated directly with decreased recovery of enzyme activity after rehydration. The damage to the protein, under conditions where dissociation was studied, was due to a large decrease in pH in the frozen state (e.g., from pH 7.5 to 4.5), which was attenuated by protective levels of polymers. Thus, inhibition of freezing-induced pH shifts, in addition to stabilization by the preferential exclusion mechanism, plays an important role in the protection conferred by polymers. Furthermore, high concentrations of these polymers were capable of maintaining quaternary structure during subsequent drying and rehydration. We suggest that the proximate cause for increased recovery of active, native protein after lyophilization is that the holoenzyme is more resistant to the stresses of drying/rehydration than unassociated monomers.

Application to synthesis of polymeric biomaterials featuring intrinsic radiopacity,MACROMOLECULES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BLOOD COMPATIBLE POLYMERS,"The properties of co- and terpolymers (physical, mechanical, chemical, biocompatibility, etc.) strongly depend on their microstructural details. In the course of our research work on biomaterials that feature intrinsic radiopacity, we became interested in the microstructural details of co- and terpolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and 2-(2'-iodobenzoyl)ethyl methacrylate (1) or 2-(4'-iodobenzoyl)ethyl methacrylate (2). A new method, based on H-1-NMR at 400 MHz, was used to study the copolymerization reactions 1 + HEMA, 1 + MMA, 2 + HEMA, and 2 + MMA. This method was found to be convenient, fast, and accurate, and it is put forward that this approach can also be applied to study other copolymerization reactions. The results, obtained with the error-invariables method (EVM), are as follows: 1 + HEMA, r(1) = 1.09 +/- 0.14, r(HEMA) = 1.12 +/- 0.06; 1 + MMA, r(1) = 0.54 +/- 0.12, r(MMA) = 0.67 +/- 0.06; 2 + HEMA, r(2) = 2.18 +/- 0.72, r(HEMA) = 2.29 +/- 0.38; 2 + MMA, r(2) = 0.93 +/- 0.32, r(MMA) = 0.90 +/- 0.13. Based on these data, a triad analysis was performed. It is concluded that all four copolymerizations afford random-type macromolecules. Therefore, it is most likely that terpolymers consisting of 1 or 2, HEMA, and MMA will also have a random character. This conclusion is of interest, since it gives a better insight into the different biochemical and physicochemical properties of this type of co-/terpolymers. The results imply that random copolymers, built-up from a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic component, can also exhibit low thrombogenicity; this is in line with recent studies by Mathew et al. (Biomaterials 1993, 14, 57).","UNIV LIMBURG,MAASTRICHT CTR BIOMAT RES,NL-6200 MD MAASTRICHT,NETHERLANDS; EINDHOVEN UNIV TECHNOL,EINDHOVEN POLYMER LABS,NL-5600 MB EINDHOVEN,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,22,16,17,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,AUG 12,1996.0,29,17,,,,,5513,5519,,10.1021/ma951399s,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,VC269,WOS:A1996VC26900001,,,,,2019-02-25

Significant differences were observed among the volumes and white blood cell (WBC) counts of the pouch exudates, based on the various crystal types used to induce inflammation, A strong correlation was demonstrated between the specific surface (SS) area of the injected crystals and the area under the curve for induced WBC count versus time (R(2) = 0.88, P = 0.05), This correlation was observed for SS area values below 50 m(2)/gm, but when SS area increased further, this parameter plateaued, Another parameter of inflammatory response was obtained by dividing the area under the curve figuring WBC counts versus time by the corresponding SS area for each crystal type, This parameter increased linearly with the Ca:P ratio (R(2) = 0.97, P = 0.0003), Conclusion. The inflammatory potential of BCP crystals appeared to vary according to crystal features, SS area and the Ca:P ratio (which correlates with crystal solubility) influenced inflammatory properties, These results could explain the variable clinical consequences of BCP deposits, and must be taken into account in the choice of apatite ceramics for use as biomaterials.","ECOLE NATL SUPER CHIM,URA CNRS 445,TOULOUSE,FRANCE; LAB RECH ORTHOPED,URA CNRS 1432,PARIS,FRANCE","Prudhommeaux, F (reprint author), UNIV PARIS 07,HOP LARIBOISIERE,CTR VIGGO PETERSEN,LAB HISTOPATHOL SYNOVIALE ER 254,F-75475 PARIS 10,FRANCE.",,,,,,,46,48,48,1,4,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0004-3591,,,ARTHRITIS RHEUM,Arthritis Rheum.,AUG,1996.0,39,8,,,,,1319,1326,,10.1002/art.1780390809,,,,8,Rheumatology,Rheumatology,VB470,WOS:A1996VB47000008,8702440.0,,,,2019-02-25

Studies of drug sorption to new catheter materials are therefore important. Pellethane(TM), a polyurethane increasingly used in vascular access catheters, is as yet little studied in terms of its capacity for drug sorption. In this work a range of drugs known to be sorbed by PVC infusion sets were studied with respect to their sorption by Pellethane catheters. Standard lengths of catheter were incubated with solutions of drugs and samples of the solution were taken at intervals, assayed spectrophotometrically and compared with control solutions incubated without catheter. Losses from solution of up to 93% were found after 24 h. A series of highly sorbing and clinically relevant drugs was identified and their uptake was studied until equilibrium had been reached. A correlation was evident between the octanol/water partition coefficient and the fraction of drug taken up from solution at equilibrium, with the more hydrophobic drugs being taken up to a greater extent by the catheter.

A model representing upper urinary tract conditions was employed to compare the long-term struvite and hydroxyapatite encrustation of five materials currently used in the fabrication of ureteral stents. Silicone was least prone to struvite encrustation, followed by polyurethane, silitek, percuflex and hydrogel-coated polyurethane, in rank order.

Whereas nanoparticles made from PLA and stabilized by surfactants (PLA-F68) are rapidly phagocytized, the rate of phagocytosis is strongly reduced in case of nanoparticles made from a diblock copolymer (PLA-PEO). Because of the role of the complement system in opsonization, this difference of phagocytosis was hypothesized to be related to this system. An important complement consumption was obtained in 5 min in the presence of PLA-F68 particles. In the presence of a higher surface area of PLA-PEO particles possessing a high PEO surface density, the consumption remained very low. When the average PEO surface density was decreased on such particles below a given threshold, a fast and strong complement consumption occurred again. These experimental data support the concept of steric repulsion towards proteins, by surfaces covered with terminally attached PEO chains and emphasize the prime importance of PEO surface density in such an effect. The major, but probably not exclusive, role of complement as an opsonin capable of inducing a fast phagocytosis by MPS should be taken into account concerning the in vitro evaluation of nanoparticles as candidates for a long blood circulation.

Collagen (type III) was also linked with the carboxylic group of PAA grafted onto the SR surface via a carbodiimine agent to obtain a secondary structure of SR. The SR surface properties were characterized by ATR-FTIR, ESCA, contact angle, and SEM. The biocompatibility of the SR surface was evaluated by a culture of cornea epithelial (CE) cells. Subsequently, 75-450 mu g cm(-2) of pAA were obtained on the SR surfaces under different reactive conditions; 3-12 mu g cm(-2) of collagen were linked on modified surfaces of SR. Moreover, ATR-FTIR and ESCA were utilized to confirm the proceedings of these reactions. The hydrophility of the modified SR was measured by a contact angle meter. The values of contact angle for SR grafted with pAA were approximately 45-50 degrees; a 50-55 degrees contact angle on pAA-g-SR to be further linked with collagen was subsequently obtained. Moreover, the influence of surface properties toward migration, growth and attachment of CE cells on the modified surfaces was also examined. Here, untreated SR was used as a control. Experimental results indicated that the number of CE cells attached onto the controlled SR was negligible. The attach ment of cells onto pAA-grafted surfaces was clearly observed and peusopoda occurred; however, cell growth was depressed. This depression may have been caused by the acid environ ment of the pAA-grafted membrane. Nevertheless, both cell attachment and growth onto collagen-linked surfaces were significant. In addition, the morphology of the cells attached onto this surface was considered normal for primary cells. Collagen introduced on the SR surface was not denatured, i.e. the natural properties of collagen were maintained. The results obtained in this study will hopefully lead to the successful development of modified SR for clinical applications.

The studies of carbon films as coatings for implants in surgery were aimed on the investigations of biological resistance of implants, histopathological investigations using laboratory animals, tests of corrosion resistance, measurements of mechanical properties and a breakdown test in Tyrod solution. The comparison of the properties of the coating produced by these methods shows very good biotolerance and biocompatibility of all of the coatings. They are not corroded in physiological fluids. From the other side they have different properties, especially electrical and optical, and are not influenced on medical applications.

Several advantages of peat moss for such applications include its abundance, low cost, and high metal capacity. A Ca-loaded column of peat moss was therefore studied with mixtures of metals. Metals bind to anionic sites by displacing protons from acidic groups (K-ex(H)) or existing metals from anionic sites at high pH (K-ex). These ion-exchange equilibrium constants were determined in batch experiments by direct measurement of species in solution and sorbed on the solid phase. The same K-ex values of Mg 0.342, Mn 0.862, Ca 1.00, Ni 1.42, Zn 1.88, Cd 2.82, Cu 9.97, and Pb 26.7 relative to Ca were found for a given metal alone or in the presence of a mixture, thus showing that the metals function independently. Under conditions employed for a Mg/Mn mixture, it was found that ion-exchange equilibria were maintained along the column due to very fast rates for metal-metal exchange as measured in a separate kinetic study. A linear relationship for log K-ex(H) vs pH over 10(6) was interpreted as due to metal binding to sites of different acid strengths.","MESSIAH COLL,GRANTHAM,PA 17027; GEORGETOWN UNIV,DEPT CHEM,WASHINGTON,DC 20057",,,,,,,,27,120,122,1,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Clinically, these patients may require an ACL reconstruction. In an attempt to develop an improved ligament prosthesis, a prototype xenograft - an epoxy-fixed porcine Achilles tendon - was developed. The study was intended to investigate the crosslinking characteristics of the epoxy-fixed porcine tendons fixed at different pHs (4.0, 7.4, 9.0, and 10.5), temperatures (4, 25, and 37 degrees C), and fixative concentrations (1, 2, or 4%). Samples of each group were taken out at various elapsed fixation periods. The crosslinking characteristics-fixation index, denaturation temperature, and moisture content - of each sample were determined. Additionally, the stiffness of the epoxy-fixed tendons under various fixation conditions was qualitatively compared. Ln the study it was noted that the color of porcine Achilles tendons remained natural after epoxy fixation. With increasing pH, temperature, or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed tendons increased. However, the fixed porcine tendons tended to be stiffer at a higher pH, temperature, or fixative concentration. The moisture contents of the epoxy-fixed tendons were relatively lower than the fresh ones, while they were approximately the same at different pHs, temperatures, and fixative concentrations. The implications of these findings for the epoxy-fixed porcine tendons in ACL reconstruction require further investigation.

This is due (in part) to the failure of these materials to mimic the mechanical properties of the host tissue they replace. If bioprosthetic materials could be engineered to meet the mechanical performance required in vivo, the functional lifetime of implants would be increased. In this study, glutaraldehyde/solvent solutions of decreasing dielectric constant (polarity) were utilized to modify the properties of crosslinked collagen in whole bovine pericardial tissue. Solvents included phosphate buffer, methanol, 95% (w/w) ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol. Exogenous crosslinking was verified in collagen by thermal denaturation tests and amino acid analyses. Tensile mechanical behavior of collagenous pericardial samples was found to depend upon the dielectric constant (polarity) of the glutaraldehyde/solvent solutions employed; however, treatment in the solvents alone had little, if any, effect. As the dielectric constant of the solvents decreased, three mechanical properties were systematically altered: plastic strain fell from a mean of 8.9 +/- 1.5% (buffer) to 1.6 +/- 0.4% (n-butanol); strain at fracture increased from 32.2 +/- 2.6% (buffer) to 55.6 +/- 4.6% (n-butanol); and percent stress remaining after 1000-s stress relaxation from an 80-g initial load fell from 86.3 +/- 1.1% (buffer) to 76.9 +/- 1.0% (n-butanol). Crosslinking using a glutaraldehyde/n-butanol solution produced materials with tensile mechanical behavior that was very close to that of fresh tissue; however, the flexural properties of the treated tissue were different from those of fresh tissue. This decoupling of the flexural and tensile mechanical behaviors of crosslinked bioprosthetic materials is unique to this form of treatment. The observed phenomena may be the results of conformational changes in collagen facilitated by polar/nonpolar interactions with the solvent that are ''locked in'' by the action of glutaraldehyde. This technique may aid in the ''customized'' design of mechanical properties in tissue-derived biomaterials.

A 7 x 5 cm prosthesis of STP (n = 12) or MM (n = 12) was implanted into a defect of the same size (involving all layers except skin) created in the anterior abdominal wall in 24 New Zealand rabbits. The prostheses were anchored to the recipient tissue, in direct contact with the intestinal loops and connective tissue. After 14, 30, 60 and 90 days, groups of six implants were studied macroscopically and samples were taken to be processed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemical studies and tensiometry. All animals were valid for the study. In th ree cases STP implants presented very loose adhesions in the peripheral zones corresponding to the sutures. They were also observed on three MM implants, in the area of the perforations. Light and scanning microscopy revealed the formation of a capsule of scar tissue surrounding both types of prosthesis. At day 90, bridges of connective tissue had formed in the perforated areas of MM. Good vascularization was established in the areas of recipient tissue corresponding to both implants. The macrophage reaction to both biomaterials was maximal at 14 days, after which it progressively decreased until day 90. Tensile testing revealed no significant differences between the two biomaterials.

The expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA, a cytokine secreted by macrophages, was selected to estimate the extent of inflammation. The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA in the HL60 cells cultured on various substrates and in Various conditions was studied. Expression of IL-1 beta could be successfully determined by RT-PGR analysis. A 48 h incubation period was necessary to clarify the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA. It became clear that lipopolysaccharide stimulation was not necessary in this analysis because of the high sensitivity of RT-PCR analysis. It is concluded that RT-PCR analysis is a powerful tool for studying cell-polymer interaction, and is a complementary method for ELISA.

For the first time we have measured the concentration of mineral elements, at different time intervals after implantation, along a cross-section. The distribution according to mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Fe) in the implant, in the receiver site and also at the interface, showed that the kinetics of coral resorption was faster than that of hydroxyapatite; in the same way, the osseous attack was not global but, rather, centripetal.

The PMN were exposed to a shear stress of 0.19 Pa (1.9 dynes cm(-2)) or were allowed to adhere without the stress component (static control) during 30 min for all four biomaterials. Observation by light microscopy was performed in situ in the flow chamber at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. The total number of adherent cells as a function of time and the activation status of the population on the basis of morphological criteria were determined. On the hydrophilic material adhesion of activated PMN was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than on the more hydrophobic surfaces. This effect was most pronounced for the adhesion of neutrophils to glass and polypropylene (PP). Polyethylene (PE) showed only minor adhesion rates. Scanning electron microscopy revealed details of cell shape changes and permitted a more precise classification of populations of neutrophils based on distinctive shapes. As PMN were exposed to shear stress on glass, the majority of cells exhibited surface veils, ridges and ruffles, suggesting a high level of cell migration. In this case, on polymeric surfaces the presence of filopodial networks (FEP-Teflon) and ameoboid cell shapes (PP and PE) was noted. The results suggest that a low shear stress, as well as various chemical and physical properties of biomaterial surfaces, are together responsible for differentiation of PMN populations on solid substrata.

The objective was to test the effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the attempt to modulate the adhesive process, thus improving the biomaterial/visceral peritoneum interface. We have carried out an experimental study using the New Zealand white rabbit, implanting a 7 x 5 cm(2) polypropylene prosthesis into the anterior abdominal wall in such a way that it replaced all the tissue layers and was in contact with the intestinal loops. Three study groups were established: group I (control), in which only implantation of the biomaterial was performed; group II, in which the prosthesis was pretreated with a solution of PC; and group III, in which the implants were treated as in group II and the animals underwent intraperitoneal administration of 10 ml of the same solution. The animals were killed on postimplantation day 14. The total surface of the prosthesis occupied by adhesions was measured and light and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyse the healing process. In comparison with the controls, groups II and III did not present significant differences with respect to the resistance or extension of the adhesions. The microscopic results showed a rapid formation of disorderly and well-vascularised scar tissue enveloping the entire prosthesis. Thus, PC was unable to modulate the process of adhesion formation between the prosthesis and the organs of the abdominal cavity; nor did it induce changes in the cells of sufficient importance to alter the results of the healing process in the presence of this biomaterial.

Double layered collagenic matrices were prepared with purified collagens extracted from human placental tissues. Two types of patches were tested, the first constituted from a collagen type I+III layer covered by collagen IV in a liquid phase (patch I+III/IV) and the second from a collagen IV layer covered by liquid collagen IV (patch IV/IV). The matrices were applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic wall defect in the rat. Healing evolution was determined by macroscopic, microscopic and immunostaining studies. The reconstitution of the three colonic wall layers was achieved within 45 days without retraction or inflammatory reaction, while the biomaterial was resorbed. Human collagen I and III antibodies failed to stain extracellular matrix. This failure may be a consequence of outdated antibodies or more likely epitope alteration during extraction and preparation of the collagens. A human collagen type IV antibody staining of the scar zone showed the basement membranes of newly developed vessels within 10 days, and newly formed colonic mucosa within 20 days. The collagen reconstituted matrix was able to assist healing of normal digestive tract defects as shown by the labelling of the new synthesized extracellular matrix by collagen type IV antibody. These findings support the use of collagen biomaterial in gastro-intestinal anastomosis. This new surgical approach allowing healing of colonic wall defects could reduce occurrence of anastomotic leakage in human.

The early rationale for ceramic biomaterials was based upon the chemical and biochemical inertness (minimal bioreactivity) of elemental compounds constituted into structural forms (materials). Subsequently, mildly reactive (bioactive), and partially and fully degradable ceramics were identified for clinical uses. Structural forms have included bulk solids or particulates with and without porosities for tissue ingrowth, and more recently, coatings onto other types of biomaterial substrates. The physical shapes selected were application dependent, with advantages and disadvantages determined by: (1) the basic material and design properties of the device construct; and (2) the patient-based functional considerations. Most of the ceramics (bioceramics) selected in the 1960s and 1970s have continued over the long-term, and the science and technology for thick and thin coatings have evolved significantly over the past decade. Applications of ceramic biomaterials range from bulk (100%) ceramic structures as joint and bone replacements to fully or partially biodegradable substrates for the controlled delivery of pharmaceutical drugs, growth factors, and morphogenetically inductive substances.

By intelligent utilization of principles governing the structure/property relationship of these polymers, one can generate systems which resemble, in principle, the physical-mechanical behavior of living tissue. Thus, it is not surprising that these materials played a major role in development of small caliber vascular grafts targeted for vascular access, peripheral and coronary artery bypass indications. Numerous technologies, often esoteric in nature, were and are utilized to generate porous, potentially multilayered conduits possessing some or many characteristics of natural blood vessels. Properties such as durability elasticity, compliance, pulsatility, and propensity for healing became attainable via polyurethanes. Furthermore, additional surface and/or bulk modification via attachments of biologically active species such as anticoagulants, cell proliferation suppressants, anti-infective compounds or biorecognizable groups are possible due to reactive groups which are part of the polyurethane structure. These modifications are designed to control or mediate host acceptance and healing of the graft. Finally, a myriad of practical processing technologies are used to fabricate functional grafts. Among those, casting, electrostatic and wet spinning of fibers and monofilaments, extrusion, dip coating or spraying of mandrels with polymer/additive solutions are often coupled with chemical-potential-difference-driven coagulation and phase inversion leading to grafts feeling and often behaving like natural vessels. Historically, the first polyurethanes utilized were hydrolytically unstable polyester polyurethanes containing hydrolysis-prone polyester polyols as soft segments, followed by hydrolytically stable but oxidation sensitive polyether polyols based polyurethanes. Polyether-based polyurethanes and their clones containing silicone and other modifying polymeric intermediates represented significant progress. Many viable technologies were discovered and developed using polyether-based polyurethanes. Chronic in vivo instability observed on prolonged implantation became, however, a major roadblock. The path led finally to the use of hydrolytically and oxidatively stable polycarbonate polyols as the soft segment to generate biodurable materials with resistance to biodegradation adequate for vascular access or perhaps peripheral graft indications. This biodurability needs to be further increased in order to utilize the full potential of polyurethanes in development of patent small caliber graft. Modification of both the soft and hard segments needs to be considered in order to maximize biodurability of both basic building blocks of the polyurethane. This paper reviews the achievements, discusses trends, and offers the view of the future in this exciting area of material/device combination.","CARDIOTECH INT INC, WOBURN, MA 01801 USA",,,,,,,,90,64,67,4,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0885-3282,1530-8022,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

A comparison with conventional metallic alloys used as articular implants is established. To determine the corrosion behavior we employed electrochemical methods: evaluation of corrosion potential E(corr), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and anodic polarization curves. The corrosion resistance of the MA-956 superalloy preoxidized at 1100 degrees C during 100 h is at least two orders of magnitude higher than for the other alloys. This satisfactory behavior is stationary with time. Also the probability of the appearance of the pitting corrosion process is very low. When cracking is generated in the alpha-alumina layer the repassivation process is assured because of the high Cr content in the superalloy. This study is the first step in proposing this new alloy as a biomaterial. The low toxicity of these metallic alloys in the physiological environment suggests that in vivo their biocompatibility could be satisfactory.

The measured light-scattering coefficients of the implant synovial fluid samples were significantly larger than the coefficients of the control samples (p < 0.0001). The enhanced light scattering was attributed to the presence of submicron UHMWPE particles. This is consistent with light-scattering considerations and a Raman spectroscopy survey of synovial fluid. The mean particle volume fraction of UHMWPE was 1.11 x 10(-5) cm(3)/mL for the six implant samples, with mean particle diameters in the range of 200-300 nm. The UHMWPE volume fractions were found to differ by a factor of 2 between the osteolytic and nonosteolytic cases.

When the surface of segmented polyurethane, in which endothelial cells are not capable of proliferating, is modified by carbon deposition, cell adhesion and proliferation occurred selectively on the carbon-deposited region. Carbon deposition to a tissue culture-treated polystyrene surface on which cells are capable of proliferating further promoted cell spreading and proliferation. Cell patterning on carbon-deposited segmented polyurethane was also attempted by controlling the direction or region of cell proliferation. Carbon deposition onto the polymer surface brought about a decrease in the water contact angle of the surface. Precoating fibronectin or laminin on the carbon-deposited polymer surface brought about cell adhesion and proliferation in the carbon-deposited region, but not in the non-carbon-deposited region. Our data suggest that promotion of cell proliferation on a carbon-deposited surface is probably due to selective adhesion of adhesive proteins to the surface.

A heavy infiltrate of foreign body macrophages in response to biomaterial wear particles is commonly found in the fibrous membrane surrounding loose components. It has recently been shown that foreign body macrophages can differentiate into osteoclastic cells. To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of bone resorption have a role to play in controlling the osteolysis of aseptic loosening, we analyzed the effect of a bisphosphonate, disodium ethane-1, 1-diphosphonate (EHDP) on this process. Murine monocytes and foreign body macrophages (derived from granulomas formed by subcutaneous implantation of particles of prosthetic biomaterials) were co-cultured with UMR106 osteoblast-like cells in the presence of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D-3 for 14 days on glass coverslips and bone slices. EHDP significantly inhibited bone resorption in these co-cultures. There was little or no expression of the osteoclast-associated enzyme, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in EHDP-treated co-cultures. Addition of EHDP to monocyte-UMR106 co-cultures after the appearance of TRAP-positive cells did not abolish bone resorption, indicating that EHDP, in addition to its known inhibitory effect on osteoclast function, suppresses differentiation of osteoclast precursors. EHDP inhibition of the osteolysis induced by particulate biomaterial-associated macrophages shows that pharmacological inhibition of bone resorption might be used to control the osteolysis of aseptic loosening.","NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,DEPT PATHOL,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,NUFFIELD DEPT PATHOL & BACTERIOL,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND",,,,,Wellcome Trust,,,33,26,29,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0001-6470,,,ACTA ORTHOP SCAND,Acta Orthop.

This turn of events was made possible by an improved understanding of the biological response of living tissues to implants as well as clinical trials that validated the long-term success of these implants. Despite major structural differences between teeth and implants, such as the absence of a periodontal ligament around implants, the latter appear to provide a reliable functional replacement for their natural counterparts. This review briefly summarizes the major structural differences of the interfacial region of teeth and dental implants and their supporting tissues. It focuses on our current understanding of the soft and hard tissue responses to submerged and nonsubmerged root-form dental implants. The influence of a number of factors that affect the tissue response is reviewed, including biomaterials, implant design, surgical technique, and the local microbiota. Our recently acquired ability to modulate wound healing with guided tissue regeneration and growth factors will undoubtedly play an important role in the future utilization and success rates of dental implants.

Methods-Biomaterial particles (polymethylmethacrylate, high density polyethylene, titanium, chromium-cobalt, stainless steel) were implanted subcutaneously into mice. Macrophages were isolated from the foreign body granulomas that resulted, cultured on bone slices and coverslips, and assessed for both cytochemical and functional evidence of osteoclast differentiation. Results-Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) negative macrophages isolated from granulomas containing particles of all types of biomaterial composition were capable of differentiating into TRAP positive cells capable of extensive lacunar bone resorption (assessed by scanning electron microscopy). The presence of both UMR106 rat osteoblast-like cells and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-3 was necessary for this to occur. Conclusion-All implant materials produce wear particles that are the focus of a heavy foreign body macrophage response in the fibrous membrane between a loose implant component and the host bone undergoing resorption. These findings underline the importance of biomaterial wear particle generation and the macrophage response to different types of biomaterial wear particles in the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening.","UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,NUFFIELD DEPT PATHOL & BACTERIOL,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSP,MRC,BONE RES LAB,OXFORD OX3 9DU,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,NUFFIELD ORTHOPAED CTR,NUFFIELD DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,OXFORD OX3 7LD,ENGLAND",,,"Murray, David/D-7117-2011",,Wellcome Trust,,,39,60,63,0,0,BRITISH MED JOURNAL PUBL GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND WC1H 9JR",0003-4967,,,ANN RHEUM DIS,Ann.

This result raises the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway may be involved in the regulation of cell-biomaterial interaction. To learn more about the interaction of anchorage-dependent cells with biomaterials, four different materials with wettability ranging from hydrophilic (water contact angle 25 degrees) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 111 degrees) were investigated, i.e. clean glass (glass), aminopropylsilane (APS), octadecylsilane (ODS) and silicone (SI). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed increased stress formation and fibronectin (FN) receptor-rich focal adhesions for fibroblasts attached on more hydrophilic surfaces (glass and APS) in comparison to the relatively hydrophobic materials (ODS and SI). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, also studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, was considerably higher on glass and APS, lower for ODS, negligible for SI, and was found to colocalize with FN receptor-rich focal adhesions. Preadsorption of FN tended to restore cell adhesion and spreading on the hydrophobic ODS and SI. Quantitative data on cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation showed moderate wettable material maximum values for APS, followed by glass, ODS and SI, demonstrating a non-linearity of these parameters with the wettability of materials. Interestingly, the preadsorption of FN increased both parameters, particularly for the hydrophobic materials ODS and SI. Phosphorylation of tyrosine on FN-coated substrata was corroborated by the accessibility of binding sites estimated by ELISA using polyclonal and monoclonal FN antibodies. Our results suggest that measurement of the phosphotyrosine activity of cells may be a sensitive parameter for the ability of biomaterials to support the attachment and proliferation of cells.

Design: Open study. Setting: Specialist clinic, USA. Subjects: 3480 Out of a total of 4000 men whose primary inguinal hernias were repaired between June 1984 and June 1995. Interventions: Hernia repair involving total reinforcement of the transversalis fascia with mesh. Main outcome measure: Morbidity, particularly recurrence. Results: A total of 1776 (44.4%) were direct hernias, 1724 (43.2%) indirect, and 500 (12.5%) a combination; 456 (11.4%) were sliding hernias. Patients were followed up for a mean of 5 1/2 years (range 1-11) and 520 were lost to follow-up, leaving 3480 (87.0%) for analysis. All patients followed up were examined by a physician. There were five recurrences (0.1%), four at the pubic tubercle and one in which the mesh had torn away from the inguinal ligament because it was too narrow. There has been one recurrence in the last six years of the study. One patient developed orchitis. There was one case of postoperative neuralgia. There were no seromas that required aspiration. Most patients had returned to work within two weeks, including the manual workers. Conclusion: Repair of primary inguinal hernias under local anaesthesia with the open, tension-free technique using polypropylene mesh results in acceptable morbidity, and appreciable reductions in postoperative discomfort, duration of hospital stay, recurrence rate and costs.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,HARBOR MED CTR,RES & EDUC INST,DEPT SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,CEDARS SINAI MED CTR,DEPT SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024","Amid, PK (reprint author), LICHTENSTEIN HERNIA INST,9201 SUNSET BLVD,SUITE 505,LOS ANGELES,CA 90069, USA.",,,,,,,39,184,191,0,5,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Correlations were made between the number of adherent bacterial cells (S, aureus) and each of the calculated components of surface free energy (ie., dispersion, polarity and hydrogen bond) of biomaterials. The effect of antibodies to cell-adhesion molecules on bacterial adhesion was also studied using monoclonal antibodies to vitronectin receptor fibronectin receptor and CD44. This study indicates the polarity component of surface free energy plays a dominant role in the process of bacterial adhesion at least in vitro. The number of cells adherent to materials decreased to 44-73% of the control value in the presence of antibodies tested showing that cell adhesion molecules affect adherence to biomaterials. Moreover, the results suggested that bacterial adhesion was prevented by specific blockade of cell adhesion molecule receptors.","OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT BACTERIOL,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN","Kitano, T (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ABENO KU,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,10,11,0,1,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Bovine periosteum-derived cells were cultivated in vitro, put onto bio-resorbable polymer fiber constructs, and allowed to grow until most of the fibers were coated with multiple layers of osteoblasts. Standardized 9-mm nonhealing defects were created in 24 male athymic rat femurs and bridged with titanium miniplates. In 12 animals, the defects were filled with polymer constructs containing periosteum-derived cells (experimental group); in another 12 animals, the defects were either left unfilled (control group I) or filled with polymer templates alone (control group II). After 12-week in vivo implantation, the new bone produced bridged the surgically created defects completely in seven of 10 cases. The animals of the control groups did not show significant bone formation in the gap. Histologic evaluation revealed bone formation in all experimental specimens with rests of cartilage islands showing hypertrophying chondrocytes indicative of enchondral bone formation. Tissue-engineered growth of bone resulted in healing of large segmental bone defects in an orthotopic site in an animal model. The findings of this study support potential applications of the technique of tissue-engineered growth of bone to clinical situations where local bone formation is needed.

We have compared five methods for the measurement of thickness: (1) a Mitutoyo non-rotating thickness gauge; (2) a custom-built, instrumented thickness gauge which was strain-gauged to measure contact force; (3) a commercial Hall effect probe (Panametrics Magna-Mike); (4) a custom-built electrical resistance probe; and (5) measurement of fresh frozen histological sections under polarized light. Using bovine pericardium as a test material, all the methods examined were adequate to assess sample-to-sample and location-to-location differences in thickness. The resistance gauge gave significantly greater thicknesses than did the other methods, with little or no compression; indeed, extrapolation to zero load of thickness readings from the instrumented gauge yielded identical thickness. Thicknesses measured by frozen sections were indistinguishable from those measured with the non-rotating gauge, the instrumented gauge under 0.5-1.2 g compressive load, or the Hall effect probe. With the correct technique, the simple and inexpensive non-relating gauge remains a pragmatic choice for thickness measurement in planar soft tissue.

The fibroblasts were cultured on 50 nm Ti-coated silicon wafers treated with radio-frequency glow discharge prior to use and on Falcon tissue culture plastic (TCP) dishes as a control. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that fibroblasts cultured on Ti reduced the fibronectin mRNA level by 58% at 16 h, but increased it by 2.6-fold at 90 h, although the cell numbers and house-keeping gene GAPD mRNA levels on these two surfaces were essentially the same. The amount of total RNA was slightly less on the Ti surface. While the total [S-35]methionine incorporation was essentially unaltered, the amount of [S-35]methionine-labeled fibronectin was significantly increased in cells cultured on a Ti surface in early cultures but decreased in the late cultures. The apparent discrepancy between the increased fibronectin mRNA levels and decreased translation could be explained by a 30% reduction in fibronectin mRNA half life in cells cultured on Ti. The distribution of fibronectin between the medium and the cell layer also was altered on Ti surfaces, with a similar to 100-fold increase of fibronectin assembled in extracellular matrix at 16 h, but a 36% reduction at 90 h. In contrast, the amount of fibronectin recovered in the medium was essentially unchanged. The total amount of protein assembled into the extracellular matrix by cells on Ti increased 2.1-fold at 16 h but decreased by 19% in 90-h cultures. These significant changes in fibronectin gene activity and gene product distribution by cells cultured on Ti surfaces demonstrate that the surface chemistry of biomaterials can selectively regulate the cellular behavior at the molecular level and, conversely, that molecular biological techniques provide sensitive indicators of the molecular biocompatibility of implant materials.

Implants of polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polypropylene prostheses were introduced into the abdominal wall of New Zea la nd rabbits. The behaviour of the biomaterials was analysed using light and scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in which a specific anti-rabbit macrophage monoclonal antibody (RAM 11) was employed. According to macroscopic observation,there was significantly fewer adhesions prosthesis-viscera to ePTFE than to polypropylene implants. After ePTFE implantation, restoration of the peritoneum took place in an orderly fashion. When polypropylene was used, the peritoneum formed was a disorderly tissue in which small areas of haemorrhage and necrosis could be seen to coincide with the appearance of adhesions. The number of labelled macrophages peaked 14 days after ePTFE or polypropylene implantation, after wh ich it decreased gradually. It is concluded that, given the low rate of adhesion provoked by PTFE, this material is ideal for im-plants contiguous to the peritoneal cavity viscera. The macrophage response does not determine the use of one material or the other.

The role of blood proteins in the pathogenesis of implant infection has been investigated, but research into the role of CSF proteins in shunt infections has not been undertaken, even though a high CSF protein has been assumed to increase the risk of such infections. Methods-New shunt catheters were exposed to either CSF or individual protein solutions, and the numbers of radiolabelled staphylococci that adhered to them were compared with controls that had been exposed to saline only. Results-A significant reduction in bacteria adhering to the test catheter was found in each instance. Furthermore, the CSF with the highest protein content, from a patient with intraventricular haemorrhage, had the greatest inhibitory effect on bacterial adhesion. The effect of the solutions on the hydrophobicity of the silicone rubber was also investigated. The silicone rubber was more hydrophilic, and bacterial adhesion was less, with solutions containing a higher protein content, and these findings were in keeping with the current theories on the mechanism of bacterial adhesion to polymers. Conclusions-A high CSF protein content does not predispose to the development of shunt infections.","GREAT ORMOND ST HOSP CHILDREN, DEPT NEUROSURG, LONDON, ENGLAND; INST CHILD HLTH, DEPT ACAD MICROBIOL, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,50,15,15,0,2,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0022-3050,1468-330X,,J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS,J.

The use of the machine does not require a chart recorder but it can be linked to a personal computer, either to show force-displacement relationships or for data storage. The design allows the use of any relatively 'soft' mechanical test, i.e. tests in which the deformability of the frame of the machine and its load cell do not introduce significant errors into the results.

The tissue reaction evoked by films of these new biomaterials implanted into the dorsolumbar musculature of rats was assessed quantitatively using a well established technique based upon an image analysis system. The number of inflammatory cells present and the patterns of cell distribution around the implant up to a distance of 642 mu m were examined at different time periods after implantation. Since a well-delineated tissue-material interface was needed for this type of investigation, it was not possible to apply image analysis to sections once dissolution of the implanted materials had begun. Films of both the total esters, HYAFF 7 and HYAFF 11, were found to undergo a slow dissolution process and, after a month, films of these materials were still present at the site of implantation. Differences in response to the two materials were observed only during the first two weeks, particularly with respect to neutrophil distribution and total cellularity. HYAFF 7 was found to be more reactive, with higher numbers of neutrophils near the surface of the implant than HYAFF 11. Thereafter, the differences between the two materials were minimal and owing mainly to a faster dissolution of HYAFF 7 films. After 3 and 5 months, considerable degradation of films of both total esters had occurred. Significant quantities of material appeared inside numerous macrophages with an ED1-positive phenotype. Only a very thin layer of fibrous connective tissue, indicative of low reactivity, was found to surround the site of implantation, separating the dissolved material and the phagocytic cells from healthy muscular tissue. ED2-positive macrophages were primarily confined within the lining connective tissue. The partial benzyl ester, HYAFF 11p75, showed a different behaviour. In fact, evidence of film dissolution was already present a week after the implantation. After two weeks, the implanted films were completely dissolved and numerous ED1-positive macrophages phagocytosing the material were observed at the site of implantation. Therefore, in agreement with previous in vitro studies, which showed a greater susceptibility to degradation of hyaluronan derivatives with lower percentage of esterification, HYAFF 11p75 underwent resorption faster than the corresponding total ester.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND; FIDIA ADV BIOPOLYMERS SRL,I-35031 ABANO TERME,PADUA,ITALY",,,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012; Campoccia, Davide/K-5348-2018","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778; Campoccia, Davide/0000-0002-3336-0219",,,,16,55,56,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAY,1996.0,17,10,,,,,963,975,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)84670-9,,,,13,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UL396,WOS:A1996UL39600003,8736730.0,,,,2019-02-25

The surface-bound complement factors were detected by ellipsometry-antibody techniques. The overall complement activation was subsequently corroborated independently with enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and sheep and chicken erythrocyte haemolytic complement techniques. EIA experiments indicated elevated levels of C4d, but no significant increase of factor Bb was evident in the test serum from the MG system. The haemolytic assays show that MG surfaces consume complement factors from both pathways. Ellipsometry revealed that immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement factor 1q (C1q) are transiently antibody detectable on MG after exposure to whole serum by the use of antibody techniques. Complement factor 3 (C3), C2, C4 and properdin could be detected on the surface, but not factors H and B.

The effect of degree of lipid hydration, phospholipid chemical structure, mesophase identity, aqueous medium composition, and incident flux on the severity and progress of damage was quantified using time-resolved x-ray diffraction and chromatographic analysis of damage products. Electron spin resonance measurements of spin-trapped intermediates generated during irradiation suggest a free radical-mediated process. Surprisingly, radiation damage effects revealed by x-ray diffraction were imperceptible when the lamellar phases were prepared under water-stressed conditions, despite the fact that x-ray-induced chemical breakdown of the lipid occurred regardless of hydration level, Of the fully hydrated lipid systems studied, saturated diacyl-phosphatidylcholines were most sensitive to radiation damage compared to the ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines and the ether-linked phosphatidylcholines. The inclusion of buffers or inorganic salts in the dispersing medium had only a minor effect in reducing damage development. A small inverse dose-rate effect was found when the x-ray beam intensity was changed 15-fold. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of radiation damage, to our appreciation of the importance of monitoring both structure and composition when evaluating biomaterials radiation sensitivity, and to the development of strategies for eliminating or reducing the severity of damage due to an increasingly important source of x rays, synchrotron radiation. Because damage is shown to be free radical mediated, these results have an important bearing on age-related accumulation of free radicals in cells and how these might compromise membrane integrity, culminating in cell death.","OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,COLUMBUS,OH 43210",,,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-014646]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK36849, DK46295]",,,31,37,43,1,6,BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

The integrin subunits, alpha(2), alpha(3), alpha(4), alpha(5), alpha(v), alpha(6), beta(1) and beta(3), were expressed by primary human osteoblasts cultured on PS coated with various ECM molecules, However, alpha(5) and alpha(6) were notably absent in cells attached to the alloys, Also, alpha(3) was not present on rough Ti, polished CC, or rough CC, and beta(3) was not expressed by cells on rough CC, Thus, the nature of the metal alloy appeared to influence the expression of particular integrins, As a result, the ability of cells to adhere to and receive messages from the extracellular matrix may also be influenced by the substratum, These differences may explain previously observed differences in degree of cell attachment to these metals.","THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIV, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, ORTHOPAED RES LAB, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19107 USA",,,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [HD29937, HD15822]; NIAMS NIH HHS [AR01877]",,,49,144,151,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",8756-3282,1873-2763,,BONE,Bone,MAY,1996.0,18,5,,,,,451,457,,10.1016/8756-3282(96)00044-0,,,,7,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,UJ627,WOS:A1996UJ62700008,8739903.0,,,,2019-02-25

Thin films of these materials display notable structure sensitivity to the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the underlying support. A structure-bonding model of these materials is based upon Ca2+-crown ether-like coordination to the decaethylene glycol head group of one or two of the surfactant molecules. Ca2+ binding of two surfactant head groups, makes possible cis- and trans-conformations for the alkyl tails, resulting in normal and inverted structures with preferences for hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The extent of Ca2+ ion clustering in the head group determines the geometrical packing requirements of the surfactant and the overall dimensions of the resulting lamellar liquid-crystal phases. The effect of various phosphate reagents (H3PO4, KH2PO4, K3PO4) On these ''calcitropic'' liquid-crystal phases has also been investigated. The conditions that favor the deposition of different calcium phosphate solid phases from these ''calcitropic'' lamellar precursors have been investigated, with a view to their possible use as ''controlled release biomaterials'' for supplying thin-film and nanocrystalline forms of calcium phosphate for bone restoration, replacement, and augmentation applications.

The present study was carried out to assess the expression of IL-1 Methods. Interface tissue between the implant and bone was obtained fr om hip revision operations and was compared to healthy joint capsular tissue. Membrane bound IL-1 alpha was stained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method nod was quantified using morphometry (VIDAS image analysis system). Soluble IL-1 beta was measured by ELISA. IL-1 levels were compared to collagenase activities in the same tissue as assessed by the degradation of triple helical type I collagen monomers analyzed by SDS-PAGE/laser densitometry. Results. The IL-1 alpha staining index was high in interface tissue (7.25 +/- 1.28, p < 0.01) compared to normal joint capsular tissue (0.50 +/- 0.04). Similarly, IL-1 beta levels (ng/ml; ELISA) were high in such tissue (139.0 +/- 71.9 vs 0 +/- 0, p < 0.02). Total collagenase was higher in the interface (26.3 x 10(-6) +/- 7.57 x 10(-6) IU/l, p < 0.01) than in control tissue (0.55 x 10(-6) +/- 0.44 x 10(-6) IU/l). IL-1 alpha (r = -0.04, p > 0.05) and IL-1 beta (r = 0.25, p > 0.05) did not correlate with collagenase activity in interface tissue. Conclusion. Both IL-1 (alpha and beta) and collagenase are up-regulated around loose THR, suggesting that they may play a role in loosening. However, the correlations between IL-1 and collagenase were not significant, indicating, that IL-1 is probably not the only cytokine involved in the regulation of collagenase activity in vivo. IL-1 may also contribute to loosening by its osteoclast activating properties.","INVALID FDN, ORTON ORTHOPED HOSP, HELSINKI, FINLAND; HELSINKI UNIV, CENT HOSP, DEPT MED, HELSINKI, FINLAND; YAMAGATA UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, YAMAGATA 99023, JAPAN; TOOLO HOSP, DEPT ORTHOPED & TRAUMATOL, HELSINKI, FINLAND; UNIV OSLO, NATL HOSP, INST SURG RES, OSLO, NORWAY","Konttinen, YT (reprint author), HELSINKI UNIV, INST BIOMED, DEPT ANAT, POB 9, SILTAVUORENPENGER 20A, FIN-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,34,26,26,1,2,CLINICAL & EXPER RHEUMATOLOGY,PISA,"VIA SANTA MARIA 31, 56126 PISA, ITALY",0392-856X,,,CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL,Clin.

In vitro ii biocompatibility tests were developed to simulate and predict biological reactions to materials when placed into or on tissues in the body. Traditional assays have measured cytotoxicity by means of either an end-stage event, (i.e., permeability of cytoplasmic membranes of dead and dying cells, or some metabolic parameter such as cell division or an enzymatic reaction). In vitro assays for initiation of inflammatory and immune reactions to materials have also begun to appear in the literature. More recently, the concept of dentin barrier tests has been introduced for dental restorative materials. Four models which measure both permeability and biological effects of materials are compared and discussed. Future efforts may be directed toward development of materials which will allow or promote function and differentiation of tissues associated with materials. New analytical procedures and understanding of optimal characteristics of materials should improve our ability to develop more biocompatible materials. Both molecular biology techniques, and altered design of material surfaces may make the materials either more or less reactive to the biological milieu. These trends suggest a greater future role of the biological sciences in the development of biomaterials.","MED COLL GEORGIA, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL REHABIL, AUGUSTA, GA 30912 USA","Hanks, CT (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH DENT 5223, DEPT ORAL MED PATHOL & SURG, 1011 N UNIV AVE, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09296],,,100,166,169,2,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

In this study, the passive oxide film formed on titanium and its natural growth in a phosphate buffered solution with and without an H2O2 addition have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements over a period of several weeks. In the absence of H2O2, the impedance response indicated a stable thin oxide film on titanium. However, the introduction of H2O2 into the solution resulted in significant changes in the EIS-spectra, which varied with exposure time. The interpretation of results is based upon a two-layer model of the oxide film, consisting of a thin barrier-type inner layer and a porous outer layer. The H2O2 addition in the solution led to a significant decrease in corrosion resistance of titanium and also to a thickening of the porous outer layer. The observations may provide an explanation of the unexpected in vivo titanium oxide growth and ion incorporation into titanium implant oxide surfaces.","SWEDISH CORROS INST,S-10405 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","Pan, J (reprint author), ROYAL INST TECHNOL,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,DR KRISTINAS VAG 51,S-10044 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,36,397,407,6,118,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0013-4686,,,ELECTROCHIM ACTA,Electrochim.

After adhering to biomaterial surfaces, other leukocyte reactions, such as phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and protease release, may occur and result in the deterioration of the implanted biomaterial and injury to peripheral tissue. This study of neutrophil adhesion quantitatively characterizes neutrophil adhesion under well-defined laminar flow conditions using a radial flow chamber. In this theologically well-defined system, the fluid shear rate on the surface varies continuously with radial position. This allows the study of shear-dependent behavior of neutrophil adhesion. Exploiting the variable shear rate in the radial flow chamber, the kinetics of neutrophil adhesion was obtained using automated video microscopy and image analysis to recursively acquire cell counts from multiple fields in different radial positions, and to quantify the surface density of neutrophil as a function of time. Neutrophil adhesion was studied on glass preadsorbed with fibrinogen and high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). At a shear rate of 20 s(-1), the number of adherent cells on the preadsorbed fibrinogen surface was similar to that on ban glass, and the number of adherent cells on the HK surface was less than 10% of that on the bare glass.

The crosslinked collagens were immersed in daily-renewed calcium beta-glycerophosphate solutions for 2 and 4 weeks to induce the deposition of apatite on the collagen fibers. After 2 weeks of reaction, for example, apatites deposited approximately two times the crosslinked collagen in weight. With reconstituted collagen, the complex showed some elasticity but no apatite was visually observed to detach under deformation with fingers and forceps. The complex, moreover, did not disintegrate when immersed in saline or animal blood. Nevertheless, the complex resorbed with no evidence of cytotoxity when implanted in muscle tissues. These findings suggest that the apatite-collagen complex prepared would be useful as bone substitutes, especially for periodontal osseous lesion repair and alveolar ridge augmentation.

To study the haptenic potential of these metal ions, rabbit albumin-glutathione-metal complexes with chromium, cobalt, or nickel were injected into mice. The splenocytes from one mouse in each group which developed a strong antibody against GSH-metal complexes were isolated and fused with myeloma cells to produce monoclonal antibodies.

Fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinopeptide A were found to be increased by all of the materials, though to a different extent. In particular, fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinopeptide A were significantly increased upon contact with polybutylene terephthalate and with collagen coated polyethylene terephthalate, respectively. Also, antithrombin III was shown to decrease following exposure to biomaterials, but statistical significance was found only for polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinylacetate. As a result of this wide range of variability in the parameters, it is advisable to explore the plasma coagulation system with a multiparametric approach in which thrombin formation and coagulation inhibitors are thoroughly investigated.

The cytotoxicity of a series of poly(anhydride-co-imides) with osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1) was evaluated. The imide component of the copolymers was based on pyromellitylimidoalanine and the anhydride component was based on either sebacic acid or 1,6-bis(carboxyphenoxy)hexane. Cell adhesion and proliferation on the sur faces of the polymer discs were observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. During the first 24 hours of attachment, the cells showed normal morphology when cultured on copolymers containing 1,6-bis(carboxyphenoxy)hexane. The cells did not adhere to the polymers containing sebacic acid, probably due to the rapid degradation of the polymer surfaces. Concurrently, the effects of polymer breakdown products on osteoblast-like cells were evaluated by studying their proliferation (cell numbers), viability (dye exclusion), morphology (light microscopy), and phenotypic expression. The morphology of osteoblast-like cells cultured in the presence of the polymer breakdown products pyromellitylimidoalanine and pyromellitic acid was found to be similar to that of the same cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene and consisted of a characteristic polygonal shape. With use of a monoclonal antibody to osteocalcin, these cells were shown to demonstrate preserved osteoblast phenotype with growth over a 21-day period. In addition, the cells reached confluency after 3-4 days, similar to cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene.

The metals were exposed to blood (in vitro) and peritoneal fluid (in vivo). In blood the adhesion and activation of platelets and leucocytes were studied by fluorescence microscopy using specific FITC-labeled antibodies or acridine orange. Intraperitoneal leucocyte adhesion was studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission microscopy, or by staining with acridine orange. The metallic surfaces were exposed to both blood and peritoneal fluid for times varying from 15 s to 4 h. The results show (a) that a significantly larger number of platelets followed by a correspondingly large number of leucocytes initially adhere to Ti rather than to Au, (b) that the rate of the inflammatory response as manifested by the appearance of leucocytes is more rapid in the peritoneal cavity than in blood, and (c) that cells attach directly to the Au surfaces while being separated by an amorphous layer on the Ti surfaces. Thus an interesting nexus exists between the composition of the adsorbed protein layer, platelet adsorption, and activation and the rate and nature of leucocyte recruitment and interaction with implanted materials.

X-ray reflectometry (XR) of the NH3+-terminated SAM in air revealed a 14 Angstrom thick, close-packed silane monolayer consistent with an all-trans extended hydrocarbon chain packing tilted about 30 degrees with respect to the surface normal. Neutron reflectometry (NR) of the NH3+ surface against D2O was consistent with (XR) results if it was assumed that labile protons exchange with deuterium resulting in an interface comprised largely of ND3+. NR results obtained with the SiOx surface against D2O were interpreted in terms of a porous, hydrated oxide layer about 20 Angstrom thick. NR of HSA adsorbed from D2O buffer onto NH3+ terminated SAM surfaces revealed a two-layer adsorption regime. The first layer directly adjacent to the solid surface was about 40 Angstrom thick and was essentially independent of bulk liquid concentration whereas the second layer was more strongly dependent on liquid phase concentration studied, extending an additional 40 Angstrom into solution at the maximum solution concentration (0.1% wt/V). NR results are thus consistent with multilayer or mixed-layer protein adsorption mechanism and formation of an interphase region about 80 Angstrom in thickness that separates bulk solid and bulk liquid phases. By contrast, no such interphase could be resolved for an HSA solution in contact with a water-wettable SiOx surface, suggesting that HSA does not adsorb to fully-water-wettable surfaces from water. Implications of these results in biomaterials science, especially blood contact phenomena, are briefly discussed in the summary.","NIST,DIV REACTOR RADIAT,GAITHERSBURG,MD 20899; UNIV AKRON,INST POLYMER SCI,AKRON,OH 44325; BECTON DICKINSON RES CTR,POLYMER SCI & TECHNOL DEPT,RES TRIANGLE PK,NC 27709",,,,,,,,37,58,59,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,1996.0,12,9,,,,,2256,2262,,10.1021/la950642d,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,UJ056,WOS:A1996UJ05600022,,,,,2019-02-25

This will lead to a clinical infection only if several factors favour the bacterial adhesion or the bacterial coaggregation and the feeding of the bacterial biofilm, Among the many factors involved in bacterial adhesion, we focused in this paper on the physical parameters of surface hydrophobicity of the urinary catheters (Van der Waals and acido-basic forces) and the surface hydrophobicity of the bacteria (BATH and zeta potential). We also compared scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of in vivo and in vitro infected urinary catheters, We provided evidence that the more hydrophobic the bacteria, the more they are able to colonize hydrophobic materials, whereas hydrophilic cells are able to colonize hydrophilic materials more easily. Some biomaterials were found to display an irregular texture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas : they favour both types of adhesion, Moreover the divalent cations (MgII) drastically increased the bacterial coaggregation and favour bacterial growth within the biofilm. Finally, an increase in urinary pH and ionic strength increases the colonization risk. Consequently, choice of urinary catheter biomaterial is essential as patient hygiene and diet in order to avoid clinical infections.","CHRU,HOP ROBERT DEBRE,MICROBIOL LAB,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE; UFR PHARM,MICROBIOL LAB,F-51096 REIMS,FRANCE; CHRU,HOP ROBERT DEBRE,CHIRURG GEN & DIGEST,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE","Brisset, L (reprint author), UFR ODONTOL,2 RUE GEN KOENIG,F-51100 REIMS,FRANCE.",,"Vernet-Garnier, Veronique/P-5729-2016",,,,,25,13,13,0,4,EXPANSION SCI FRANCAISE,PARIS,"31 BLVD LATOUR MAUBOURG, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0369-8114,,,PATHOL BIOL,Pathol.

Three types of HEMA gels were synthesized: neutral (HEMA), acidic (HEMA + acrylic acid), and basic (HEMA + dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate). Each gel was synthesized at four initial volume fractions to obtain different equilibrium swelling ratios and microstructures. Sorption as a function of time was measured for each gel at pH 7, 7.5, and 8. The rate of uptake by the acidic gels was more rapid than that by the neutral gels: To sorb 90% of the protein required only 1 h for the acidic gels but 15 days for neutral gels. Lysozyme did not adsorb or partition into the basic gels. The fractional approach to equilibrium was most rapid for the more swollen gels, and the effect of pH was small.

The results show that with a wavelength of 355 nm better results could be obtained with most of the matrices.

The three components of protein mixture extracted from crude peanut oil was directly determined by MALDI-MS. The result also demonstrated that these proteins are in a free manner. Since these proteins are in a 2S bond, with the traditional method, SDS-PAGE, it is not possible to decide whether the proteins exist in a combination mode or in a free manner.

Cross-linking using EDC involves the activation of carboxylic acid groups to give O-acylisourea groups, which form cross-links after reaction with free amine groups. Treatment of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with EDC (E-DSC) resulted in materials with an increased shrinkage temperature (T-s) and a decreased free amine group content, showing that cross-linking occurred. Addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide to the EDC-containing cross-linking solution (E/N-DSC) increased the rate of cross-linking. Cross-linking increased the T-s of non-cross-linked DSC samples from 56 to 73 degrees C for E-DSC and to 86 degrees C for E/N-DSC samples, respectively. For both cross-linking methods a linear relation between the decrease in free amine group content and the increase in T-s was observed. The tensile strength and the high strain modulus of E/N-DSC samples decreased upon cross-linking from 18 to 15 MPa and from 26 to 16 MPa, respectively.

We found that approximately 50% of the incorporated Ch6SO(4) in the gels leached out into the growth medium after the first 3 d in culture, and this is thought to lead to the inconsistent cell growth response.

The results showed that Ch6SO(4) at these concentrations in the medium did not stimulate the cell growth on either plain collagen gels or gels containing 20% Ch6SO(4). As an alternative strategy, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and diamines (putrescine or diaminohexane) were used to immobilize Ch6SO(4) onto the collagen gels and to cross-link the gels. The cross-linking process partially prevented the elution of Ch6SO(4) from the gels. Interestingly, only putrescine, not diaminohexane, promoted the growth of keratinocytes on the cross-linked plain collagen gels. We proposed to develop an artificial skin substitute containing putrescine as a growth factor for the human epidermal cells.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; GLASGOW ROYAL INFIRM,BURNS UNIT,GLASGOW,LANARK,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,35,49,49,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,APR,1996.0,17,8,,,,,775,780,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)81414-1,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,UE609,WOS:A1996UE60900004,8730961.0,,,,2019-02-25

Two different types of particle, soft rounded glass beads and hard angular silica particles, were used to examine the effect of particle type on the wear behaviour. The durability was measured both before and after exposure of the specimens to various biological fluids, including distilled water, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and 40% bovine serum in sterile PBS. The specimens were exposed for 7 and 28 days at 37 degrees C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. One set of experiments was carried out at 60 degrees C to determine the effect of temperature on the film stability. Environmental exposure had little direct effect on the film properties, but the fluids tended to degrade the interfacial adhesion when penetration to the interface was possible. This can occur via microscopic penetrations in the film or via the edges. The buffered saline solution appeared to be the most aggressive in this respect. A correlation between the damage mechanism during solid particle erosion and the type of particle used was found.","ADDENBROOKES HOSP,ORTHOPAED RES UNIT,CAMBRIDGE CB2 2QQ,ENGLAND; UNIV READING,JJ THOMSON PHYS LAB,READING RG6 2AF,BERKS,ENGLAND","Chandra, L (reprint author), UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT MAT SCI & MET,PEMBROKE ST,CAMBRIDGE CB2 3QZ,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,19,5,5,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0925-9635,,,DIAM RELAT MATER,Diam.

Our previous studies showed functional differentiated cells and collagen synthesis in the pore of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene implant. This study identifies and quantifies collagen types synthesized in the implant. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene polymers were implanted in the rabbit corneas. The collagen extracted from the polymer and implanted stroma after 1, 3 and 6 months was quantified by measuring hydroxyproline. The relative proportions of collagen types were determined by densitometric analysis after SDS-PAGE. The collagen-to-protein ratio in the polymer increased from 0.22 to 0.70 between the first and third month after implantation becoming similar to control cornea. So that of the protein and collagen densities in the polymer and implanted stroma were similar to the control from the third month. The collagen synthesized in the polymer was mainly type I (87%) plus a small amount of type III (8%) 1 month after implantation. The collagen distribution from the third month after implantation was similar to that of the controls and remained constant thereafter in the polymer implant and in the implanted stroma. Immunogold labelling techniques confirmed these results. Implantation of this PTFE disc induced no obvious modification of the corneal stroma, confirming that this polymer is a good interface that is compatible with the native corneal stroma. The keratocytes in this polymer rapidly adopted a corneal phenotype, distinct from the dermal or scaring phenotype as shown by the collagen types produced in the implant.

Before the advent of modern hemorheology in the 70s, studies were mainly focussed on microcirculation and validation of global hemorheological equations applied to blood circulation. Parallel studies on the microrheological properties (erythrocyte deformability and aggregation) explained analytically the non-Newtonian behavior of blood, and the essential contribution of these parameters to the understanding hyperviscosity syndromes. The development of clinical hemorheology in fact started at the international conferences held in Reykjavik (1966) and Heidelberg (1969), and with the initiation of the periodical European Microcirculation (since Nancy in 1960) and Clinical Hemorheology (since Nancy in 1979) Conferences. The current main avenues of research involve flow modelling, studies of cell-cell interaction mechanisms (aggregation and adhesion), in relation to the associated pathophysiological phenomena, such as cellular activation (platelets and leukocytes in particular), gene expression linked to blood flow (e.g. endothelial cells)... Clinically and therapeutically, it is crucial that pathophysiological studies be undertaken on the relationship existing between theological parameters and objective clinical data (local flow rates, ischemic markers, hemostatic parameters, tissue oxygen, clinical symptoms,...). The main clinical application fields are cardiovascular diseases, thrombosis, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia... Also, studies on new therapeutics or on biomaterials should also be given priority (J Mal Vasc 1996; 21 : pages 7-15).",,"Stoltz, JF (reprint author), FAC MED,DEPT HEMATOL EA1728,PLATEAU BRABOIS,F-54500 VANDOEUVRE NANCY,FRANCE.",,,,,,,138,3,3,0,2,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0398-0499,,,J MAL VASCUL,J.

This process is generally amplified in pathologic states as atherosclerosis. Atheroma originates from smooth muscle cells (SMC) which have migrated and proliferated in the vascular intima. In this study we investigated protein synthesis, collagen synthesis, and types I, Ill, and V collagen distribution by SMC in the presence of three families of water-soluble polysaccharides, heparin, fucans, and derivatized dextrans. We observed that fucan and derivatized dextran were able, as was heparin, to inhibit rat aortic SMC growth in culture. We then analyzed collagen modulation by measuring the incorporation of the radiolabeled precursor (H-3)-proline into vascular SMC. Our results showed uncoupling of the antiproliferative capacity with collagen biosynthesis. However, fucan, the most antiproliferative polysaccharide, was also the most active in inhibiting protein and collagen synthesis. In addition, compounds that decreased total collagen synthesis preferentially increased the proportion of cell-associated collagen. Interestingly, only the antiproliferative polysaccharides inhibited significantly type V collagen biosynthesis. These new biomaterials appear to be valuable tools to study and control extracellular-matrix interactions with cells from the vascular walls.

R(2) and R(2)' are computed by exploiting the differential evolution of the transverse magnetization before and after the phase-reversal pulse. Salient features of the method are its insensitivity to RF pulse imperfections and its high precision and efficiency.

The rate of their biodegradation can be reduced by treating them with different cross-linking agents. The efficiency of different reticulation procedures on thermal stability (measured by differential scanning calorimetry) and susceptibility to bacterial collagenase digestion of the final material (films or sponges) is compared. The chemical agents used on collagen gels or directly on collagen sponges and films were glutaraldehyde (GTA), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDC), cya nam ide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and the two acyl azide methods (with hydrazine or diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA)) developed in the authors' laboratory. Under these experimental conditions, collagen stabilization by the different agents increased in the following order: cyanamide < EDC < HMDC < hydrazine < DPPA < GTA. Sponges with the highest thermal stability were obtained by treating collagen gel with 0.5% GTA for 1 h at pH 5.5 (initial T-d = 75.8 degrees C; after 3 months, T-d = 75.6 degrees C). Direct treatment of collagen films with DPPA gave similar thermal stability (T-d = 72.6 degrees C) and collagenase resistance when compared with treatment with 0.6% GTA for 96 h (T-d = 74.6 degrees C). It is demonstrated that collagen sponges and films can be prepared with a wide range of thermal stability (49-75.8 degrees C) and collagenase digestion resistance (10-100%). Recent biocompatibility studies show, however, that DPPA and EDC are the best choices for preparing cross-linked collagen sponges and films.","INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS UPR 412,F-69367 LYON 7,FRANCE; COLET,LYON,FRANCE",,,,,,,,25,164,171,0,35,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Providing a comprehensive characterization of polymer blend surfaces requires a multi-instrumental approach, as no individual surface analysis technique can ascertain both the chemical and morphological nature of surfaces. In this study we have characterized the surfaces of immiscible and miscible blends of the biodegradable polymers poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA) using the surface techniques of static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SSIMS and XPS have recorded the surface enrichment of all of the blends with the PLA component. For the immiscible blends, differential charging within the XPS spectra also provides evidence of phase separation. AFM data have contrasted the surface morphologies of the immiscible and miscible blends, and the use of in situ AFM techniques has enabled the effect of blend morphology on surface erosion to be visualized. For the immiscible systems, clear phase separation morphologies can be observed and at certain blend compositions the rapid loss of the PSA from the films results in the exposure of the PLA morphology. However, as the PLA content is increased, the surface enrichment effect results in the degradation behavior of the blend being dominated by the slow degrading PLA surface layer. For the miscible systems, the in situ AFM studies visualized a disintegration of the whole blend film without the exposure of a PLA morphology, indicating that the hydrolysis of the PSA component rendered the whole film unstable. The use of SIMS, XPS, and AFM, while highlighting the complexity of polymer blend surfaces, can provide a rapid analysis of the physicochemical phenomena underlying the organization of these systems and therefore should facilitate the application of such systems as biomaterials.",,"Davies, MC (reprint author), UNIV NOTTINGHAM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,LAB BIOPHYS & SURFACE ANAL,UNIV PK,NOTTINGHAM NG7 2RD,ENGLAND.",,"Shard, Alexander/B-4530-2010; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009; Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009","Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596; Shard, Alexander/0000-0002-8931-5740; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439",,,,44,79,80,0,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,MAR 11,1996.0,29,6,,,,,2205,2212,,10.1021/ma950889h,,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,UA294,WOS:A1996UA29400049,,,,,2019-02-25

Molecular ions are observed in this ion beam sputtering of organic mixtures for peptides and oligonucleotides up to masses on the order of 10 000 Da. This matrix-enhanced SIMS exhibits substantial increases in the ionization efficiency of selected analyte molecules compared to conventional SSIMS processes, Thus, higher mass peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids become accessible to near-surface analysis by ion beam techniques, and subpicomole sensitivity has been demonstrated, A number of matrices were examined for their efficiency in ME-SIMS applications, and these initial matrix studies focused on common MALDI matrices and their isomers, The results of this survey indicate that 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid provides the best general enhancement of molecular secondary ions emitted from analyte/matrix mixtures.",,"Wu, KJ (reprint author), CHARLES EVANS & ASSOCIATES,REDWOOD CITY,CA 94063, USA.",,,,,,,34,132,134,2,25,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0003-2700,,,ANAL CHEM,Anal.

The effect of chemical treatment with amino acids is assessed in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats. Pericardial tissue from young calves was treated with L-lysine, L-glutamine, L-arginine or L-glutamic acid, each at a concentration of 0.5 M, following treatment with 0.625% glutaraldehyde. Then, the tissue was implanted into young rats for periods of 21 and 60 d, after which the calcium accumulated was quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Values similar to or higher than those found in control samples indicated a lack of effectiveness of these treatments. Only in the 21-d implantation samples treated with L-lysine and L-arginine was less calcium accumulated than in the control tissue. After 60 d of implantation, all groups showed high levels of calcium deposition. The values obtained after 60 d of subcutaneous implantation were 87.5 +/- 52.4 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-lysine, 108.7 +/- 43.5 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-glutamine, 130.4 +/- 22.4 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-glutamic acid, 119.3 +/- 27.6 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for L-arginine and 100.0 +/- 38.3 mg Ca2+ per g dry weight of tissue for the control group.

The abdominal fascia of corpses withstands forces of 60-80 N/cm in horizontal and 20-30 N/cm in vertical direction; tearing of sutures occurs below 30 N/cm in horizontal direction. Assuming the abdominal cavity to be a thin hollow sphere, the rupture forces are approximatly 4-16 N/cm for a diameter of 8-32 cm. The meshes currently in use are much stronger than this, rupturing at 40-100 N/cm. The curvature of the abdominal surface can be measured by 3D-photogrammetry and is highly significantly reduced following mesh implantation (t-test, 2-sided, P < 0.01).

The pieces were sterilized and placed individually within surgically prepared pockets in the sclera of rabbit eyes. Animals were sacrificed for routine histopathologic evaluation and transmission electron microscopic study of the eyes at 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, and 4 months following surgical implantation. The implants demonstrated excellent compatibility with the sclera and, by 14 days following implantation surgery, exhibited histiocytes, fibroblasts, and blood vessels infiltrating the internodal spaces of the highly porous material. The number of cells and the amount of extracellular matrix material deposited in the implants appeared to increase with time. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed deposition of collagen within the implants.

In this study, human keratinocytes were cultured on the surface of collagen sponges, and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to assess both the microstructure of the sponge, and the cell morphology and distribution throughout the sponge. It was found that the pore size increased with increasing depth into the sponge. Both pore size and fiber thickness increased during incubation for up to 10 days at 37 degrees C in culture medium in the absence of cells. This latter effect was not observed when the sponges were incubated in distilled water. Keratinocytes penetrated into the sponge even after only 3 days in culture. By 10 days in culture, the cells had penetrated to the maximum depth that could be examined (120 mu m from the sponge surface). In the presence of cells, the inner structure of the collagen sponge had altered after 10 days in culture, with the collagen fibers becoming thicker, and pore geometry less regular. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown at present. Although the presence of the keratinocytes increases distortion of the sponge structure, factors from the medium itself also contribute to this effect. CLSM is a powerful tool for assessing cellular interactions with bioimplants, providing both qualitative and quantitative information. It offers many advantages over scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological techniques. CLSM minimizes the time-consuming, extensive preparation of samples required with the latter two methods, and allows noninvasive serial optical sectioning of intact samples.

We previously developed a biocompatible dermal sheep collagen (DSC), which in an abdominal wall reconstruction model showed controlled biodegradation and functioned as a matrix for ingrowth of fibroblasts but not of muscle. It was hypothesized that regeneration of muscle via DSC may be possible by seeding of muscle cells. Using a syringe, mouse C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in DSC disks and incubated in methylcellulose-based growth medium, changed at 24 h into differentiation medium. An estimated 85% of the cells were well distributed, especially in the top half of the DSC disks. Some 15% of the cells ended up on top. At 4 h, all cells showed a spherical morphology, sometimes with clear adhesion plaques. At 24 h, cells on the top started to form a ''capsule'' with well-spread cells. Underneath the capsule, of the remaining 85% of the cells, approximately 30% showed adhesion and spreading on/in between collagen bundles. At day 3 after the addition of differentiation medium, the spread cells showed first indications of myotube formation. At day 7, myotube formation had proceeded, while extracellular matrix, i.e., collagen and elastin, had been deposited. This study shows that myoblast seeding into DSC is feasible, resulting in a reasonable cell distribution and survival of 45% of the cells. The surviving cells are able to differentiate into myotubes and form an extracellular matrix.

As a whole, P. aeruginosa was the most adherent while S. epidermidis was the least adherent. The estimated values of the free energy of adhesion (Delta F-adh) correlated with the amount of adherent P. aeruginosa. When POE, PLA, and PSF were exposed to hyaluronic acid (HA) before exposure to the bacteria, there was 50% more adhesion of E. coli and P. aeruginosa on POE and PLA. With respect to bacterial adhesion, the biodegradable polymers (POE and PLA) in general were not significantly different from the nondegradable polymers.

Because implant surfaces spontaneously adsorb host proteins, this proteinaceous film is probably important in the subsequent attraction of phagocytes. In fact, earlier we found that acute inflammatory responses to experimental polyethylene terephthalate implants in mice require the precedent adsorption of one particular host protein, fibrinogen. The present investigations were aimed at defining the molecular determinants of fibrinogen-mediated acute inflammatory responses to implanted biomaterials. We find: (a) plasmin degradation of purified fibrinogen into defined domains reveals that the proinflammatory activity resides within the D fragment, which contains neither the fibrin cross-linking sites nor RGD sequences; (b) the major (and, perhaps, exclusive) proinflammatory sequence appears to be fibrinogen gamma 190-202, previously shown to interact with CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1). The chemically synthesized peptide, cross-linked to albumin (which itself does not promote inflammatory responses), mimics the proinflammatory effect of adsorbed native fibrinogen; and (c) this sequence probably promotes inflammatory responses through interactions with Mac-1 because phagocyte accumulation on experimental implants is almost completely abrogated by administration of recombinant neutrophil inhibitory factor (which blocks CD11b-fibrin(ogen) interaction). We conclude that improved knowledge of such surface-protein-phagocyte interactions may permit the future development of more biocompatible implantable materials.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EMERGENCY PATHOL A 81, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA; CLEVELAND CLIN FDN, CTR THROMBOSIS & VASC BIOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44195 USA",,,,,,,,53,160,161,0,22,AMER SOC CLINICAL INVESTIGATION INC,ANN ARBOR,"2015 MANCHESTER RD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48104 USA",0021-9738,1558-8238,,J CLIN INVEST,J.

This technique has been used by the senior author in more than 95 cases with a 6-month to 15-year follow-up. This technique offers several advantages over traditional cranial remodeling techniques, including three-dimensional stabilization of the remodeled calvaria, use of local tissue obviating the need for distant donor tissue or nonautologous biomaterials, greater flexibility in the modeling of the cranial bone, and a controlled decrease in the size of the remaining craniectomy defects, thus improving potential for cranial bone regeneration and closure. Although cranial bone expansion is not applicable or even necessary in all craniofacial procedures, it nevertheless is a valuable tool of the craniofacial surgeon.","WAKE FOREST UNIV,BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,WINSTON SALEM,NC 27157; WASHINGTON REG MED CTR,FAYETTEVILLE,AR",,,,,,,,8,10,11,0,0,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

The aim of the studies was to evaluate the influence of surface seeding with viable cells on the calcium uptake of biomaterials. Materials and methods: Samples of glutaraldehyde tanned bovine pericardium (GBP, n = 52) or porcine valves (GPV, n = 50), or glycerol treated bovine pericardium (GlyBP, n = 35), which had either been rinsed with saline (GBP, n = 30; GPV, n = 26; GlyBP, n = 18) or seeded with rat fibrocytes (GBP, n = 22; GPV, n = 24; GlyBP, n = 17) were incubated with cell culture medium containing physiologic levels of calcium. Similarly treated material was implanted into the abdominal muscles of 88 rats (seeded: GBP, n = 16; GPV, n = 16; GlyBP, n = 14; non-seeded: GBP, n = 6; GPV, n = 8; GlyBP, n = 7). The specimens were analyzed two and four weeks later for their calcium content. Results: Over time untreated GBP and GlyBP calcified in vitro and in vivo while GPV retained low calcium levels in vivo. Surface seeding with rat fibrocytes significantly reduced the calcium accumulation in GBP and GlyBP in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Seeding with viable cells might be a promising method of reducing calcium accumulation in bovine pericardial implants.","UNIV HOSP MAINZ,DEPT CARDIOTHORAC & VASC SURG,MAINZ,GERMANY; UNIV HOSP MAINZ,DEPT BIOCHEM,MAINZ,GERMANY",,,,,,,,20,9,9,0,1,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD, ENGLAND HA6 2ET",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

Defects that cannot be satisfactorily treated by complicated and costly reconstructive techniques reveal a need for an alloplastic tracheal replacement. Recent experimental and clinical studies in the development of alloplastic tracheal prostheses proved that the lack of an epithelial lining on the luminal surfaces and inadequate biophysical properties and shapes of the prostheses were the main causes for failure of these prostheses. In this study a cell-seeding technique has been used. Adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of seeded mucosa cells on biomaterials in vitro were observed by scanning election microscopy (SEM). Chemical properties and surface structure of the material influenced the differentiation process. Epithelium formation of incorporated tracheal prostheses was tested in animal experiments. Isolated respiratory cells were seeded into implanted tubular prostheses of porous polyurethane or expanded polytetrafluorethylene. Light microscopy and SEM showed the tendency of epithelium formation on the surface of the lumen. Vigorous cell layers, predominantly as multiple cell layers of squamous epithelium, were observed. Ciliated or mucus cells were not detected. It can be stated that the epithelium formation on incorporated porous implants is possible. Further studies of the stability and the differentiation process of the epithelium on such implants is needed before an introduction of tracheal replacements into the clinical practice can be considered.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,OTORHINOLARYNGOL CLIN,CHARITE HOSP,BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,DERMATOL CLIN,CHARITE HOSP,BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,INST ANAT,BERLIN,GERMANY; INST TEXT RES & CHEM ENGN,DENKENDORF,GERMANY",,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Filling a defect by the application of autogenous bone is one of them. Autogenous cancellous bone is still considered to be the gold standard, but numerous shortcomings of this material, described in detail in the paper, are not taken into account. Besides, we are still unable to influence bone healing by the transplantation of autogenous bone with reference to quality, quantity of newly forming bone and the time period, in which bone healing occurs. Investigation into the different kinds of biomaterial developed to replace autogenous bone as a transplant, and their implantation into experimental animals did not result in the production of a synthetic material that was: as active as autogenous or even allogeneic cancellous bone. This was therefore not a solution to the problem. The reasons for this are multiple and are discussed in this paper. We developed a classification for bone replacement materials that differentiates between biological, synthetic, and composed materials, i.e., composite biomaterials made for bone replacement. In reference to the literature, as well as our own results, based on the implantation of more than 1200 rats, dogs and sheep with distinct materials, the plus/minus effects of the different classes, groups and subgroups of bone replacement materials are summarized and discussed. The most recent knowledge about the mechanisms of bone formation and how it is influenced by different growth factors, as well as bioactive ceramics, indicates that in the future an applicable bone replacement material will be a composite of a carrier material combined with chemotactic, inductive, morphogenetic and proliferative, chemically pure, recombinant factors, with a mainly local action.

Our laboratory has developed a method of impregnating biomaterials with suspensions containing bioactive proteins resulting in the capability of differentially modulating EC and SMC growth in vitro and in vivo following implantation. We have previously reported that 60 mu internodal distance ePTFE grafts impregnated with fibrin glue (FG) containing FGF-1 and heparin develop confluent endothelialization with transiently increased EC and SMC proliferation after 4 weeks in dogs. Thoraco-abdominal implants after 20 weeks were developed significantly thicker (139 mu) inner capsules in response to the FGF. To minimize SMC proliferation we studied the effects of FGF-1, heparin, and thrombin concentrations on SMC growth in vitro. FG caused a 182% increase (P < 0.001) in DNA synthesis. Heparin within FG diminished this effect in a dose-dependant manner, with complete inhibition of FG-induced growth at 500 U ml(-1) (versus FG alone, P < 0.001). FGF-1 within FG without heparin had no effect, but together, FGF-1 caused a dose-dependant growth increase while increasing heparin concentrations initially increased and then decreased proliferation. FGF-1 and heparin in the medium of quiescent SMCs had similar effects. Only thrombin concentrations > 3.2 U ml(-1) stimulated SMC growth and this stimulation was blocked by heparin. A synergism between FGF and heparin on EC proliferation was also found but without EC growth inhibition in response to higher concentrations of heparin. It is thus possible to modulate the relative proliferative activity of ECs versus SMCs by altering the FGF:heparin ratio. This same system may be useful with other proteins to induce other local affects by the applied protein or systemic affects following release of that protein.","EDWARD HINES JR VET ADM HOSP,HINES,IL 60141; ST BARNABAS HOSP,LIVINGSTON,NJ 07039","Greisler, HP (reprint author), LOYOLA UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT SURG,2160 S 1ST AVE,MAYWOOD,IL 60153, USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL41272, R01 HL29268]",,,15,65,69,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1996.0,17,3,,,,,329,336,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)85571-2,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,TY459,WOS:A1996TY45900012,8745330.0,,,,2019-02-25

Their surface structures were characterized by wettability and surface free energy measurements, scanning electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. It was found that these surfaces have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.0 erg cm(-2) with different charge and charge densities. The adherence of two strains of Escherichia coli (non-pathogen and pathogen) isolated from indigenous flora of trachea and pathogen flora of urethral surfaces, and uropathogenic Candida albicans to the polymeric surfaces was studied in vitro by means of microscopic techniques. The hydrophobicity of cell surfaces was determined by using two methods including adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements. The uropathogenic E. coli and C. albicans were found to be relatively hydrophobic with a similar surface free energy, approximately 40 erg cm(-2), when compared with normal E. coli strain which has 61 erg cm(-2) free energy.

For analytical purposes, characterization using megaelectron-volt He2+ ions provides a standardless, nondestructive means for accurately quantifying the composition of material surfaces and the thickness of thin films. In this study, three complementary ion backscattering techniques were utilized to characterize hydroxyapatite (HA) films: Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) can determine composition and amounts of elements heavier than He; forward recoil elastic spectrometry (FRES) can determine hydrogen content; resonance-enhanced RBS can quantify small amounts of light elements, e.g. carbon, by choosing a particular incident beam energy resulting in excitation of the light element nucleus. At this resonance energy, the scattering cross section greatly incsreases, improving elemental sensitivity. Sol-gel chemistry was used to synthesize HA films by spin coating and annealing in a rapid thermal processor. Using these techniques, the chemical composition of unfired films was Ca1.63O5.4H1.8C0.24P with a thickness of 3.01 x 10(18) atoms/cm(2) and after firing at 800 degrees C as Ca1.66O4.0H0.26C0.09P with a thickness of 2.11 x 10(18) atoms/cm(2).

Two commercial polymers: polyethylene (PE) and silicone rubber (SR) and two laboratory-synthesized polyurethanes were examined. The polyurethanes studied consisted of a polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO)-based polyurethane (PEU-base) and a sulfonated polyurethane (PEU-S03). in vitro polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion and respiratory burst activity measurements were studied using a radiolabelling technique and a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, respectively. An increased number of adherent PMNs and increased cell spreading were found on PEU-S03 compared to the PEU-base, SR and PE. The largest CL response was also found on PEU-SO3, whereas on the other hydrophobic polymers the response was smaller. Additionally, on the PEU-SO3 surface the CL response was sustained indicating more prolonged production of oxygen radicals by PMNs on this material. Upon stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OZ), the PMNs on PEU-S03 showed the lowest CL response, indicating a decreased respiratory burst activity. The other hydrophobic surfaces, PE, SR and PEU-base, showed no significant differences among them in their CL response. The residual CL response was reduced by 30% for PEU-SO3 and by 10-15% for PE, SR and PEU-base compared to the control (luminometer polystyrene cuvette only, no disc). Upon addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), all surfaces except SR showed a slightly reduced CL response. Along with PE, PEU-S03 showed the lowest CL response. These results suggest that oxygen radicals are produced during early incubation of PMNs with biomaterials, and upon subsequent stimulation of these cells, fewer oxygen radicals are produced due to cellular exhaustion.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,,,,43,9,10,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

A wide variety of materials has been used for these implants, but only a few promote osseointegration and biointegration. Titanium and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) have been the most widely used of these materials. The surface oxide of titanium appears to be central to the ability of this material to osseointegrate. The oxide limits dissolution of elements and promotes the deposition of biological molecules which allow bone to exist as close as 30 Angstrom to the surface of the implant. The details of the ultrastructure of the gap between the implant and bone remain undefined, and the consequences of elements which are released on the interface over time are not known. These areas of investigation are particularly important in defining the differences between commercially pure titanium implants and those made of titanium, aluminium and vanadium. The epithelial interface between the gingiva and titanium appears to contain many of the structural characteristics of the native tooth-gingiva interface, but details are still vague. The connective tissue interface with the titanium appears to be one of tightly fitting tissues rather than adhesion. Ceramic coatings appear to improve the ingrowth of bone and promote chemical integration of the implant with the bone. The characteristics of these coatings are complex and affect the bony response, but the mechanisms remain obscure. The degradation of the coatings is an issue of particular controversy. Progress in dental implantology is likely to continue as the interface between the material and bone is more clearly understood, and biological molecules and artificial tissues are developed.",,"Wataha, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA, SCH DENT, DEPT ORAL REHABIL, AUGUSTA, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,63,37,39,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The properties and overall integrity of mineralized tissues are in part dictated by the nature of their interfaces-sites where organic and inorganic components of the extracellular matrix interact to provide biomechanical strength, regulate mineral ion homeostasis, and influence cellular events involved in mineralized tissue modeling, remodeling, and repair. High-resolution, colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry has been used to characterize the proteinaceous composition of these interfaces and to establish that the phosphorylated sialoprotein, OPN, is a major component found at these sites where it accumulates as a dense, planar ''coating'' of organic material termed either a cement line or a lamina limitans. Structural/functional features of OPN predict an ability of this protein to regulate calcification in the matrix proper of mineralized tissues and to participate, more specifically, in cell-matrix and matrix-matrix/mineral adhesion in laminae limitantes and cement lines, respectively. From the ultrastructural immunocytochemical data presented herein for OPN illustrating the cellular expression and extracellular matrix distribution of this protein, it is demonstrated that the production of OPN is one of the earliest, and latest, secretory activities of the osteoblast lineage and that this activity manifests itself morphologically as a cement line or a lamina limitans, respectively, at bone matrix interfaces. In laminae limitantes at bone surfaces, OPN appears to be involved in osteoclast adhesion and possibly haptotaxis. An OPN-containing cement line is also present at hard tissue interfaces in rat tooth, against osseointegrated titanium and hydroxyapatite implants and at the margins of surgically created bone defects-and there may influence biological adhesion in a manner similar to that proposed for normal bone. It is suggested, therefore, that in addition to its potential for influencing cell adhesion/dynamics in bones and teeth, OPN in cement lines may act as an interfacial adhesion promoter between apposing substrates, therein maintaining the overall integrity of bone during the bone remodeling sequence and ''bonding'' dissimilar tissues (or biocompatible materials) together in biological composites such as teeth and osseointegrated implants.

Using an open surgical procedure, 23 double-J stents of 8 different types were inserted in the ureters of 13 piglets. After 6 weeks intubation, 2 (9%) of the 23 stented renal units yielded positive urine culture. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed sporadic bacteria on 7 (30%) of the 23 indwelling ureteric stents and bacterial biofilms on only 2 (9%), those indwelling the renal units which yielded positive urine cultures. Precut segments of the 8 double-J stent brands were incubated with 5 different bacterial strains. Microbiological and SEM analysis of the stents revealed that only 0.1-0.01% of the bacterial inoculum adhered to the stents. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial adherence to the various stent materials. Interestingly, the two Escherichia coli strains with P-fimbriae adhered significantly more than the two without P-fimbriae. Sporadic bacterial adhesion to ureteric stents seemed to have little clinical significance whereas biofilm formation seemed to result in urinary tract infection. None of the tested stents proved to be superior to the others in this respect, and adhesion appeared to depend on the virulence of the bacteria rather than the properties of the biomaterials.","HELSINKI UNIV,CENT HOSP,DEPT SURG 4,HELSINKI,FINLAND; HELSINKI UNIV,CENT HOSP,DEPT UROL,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA,HELSINKI,FINLAND; NATL PUBL HLTH INST,LAB ENTER PATHOGENS,HELSINKI,FINLAND; PAIJAT HAME CENT HOSP,DEPT SURG,UROL UNIT,LAHTI,FINLAND; UNIV BARI,SCH MED,BARI,ITALY",,,,,,,,21,28,28,0,8,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0036-5599,,,SCAND J UROL NEPHROL,Scand.

In this study, a new attempt was made to coat bioactive glasses on Ti-6A1-4V by plasma spraying. This method will coat the bioactive glass coatings (BGCs) onto metal substrate, potentially combining the excellent mechanical strength of metal and biocompatibility of bioactive glass. Analysis by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the BGCs, revealed that the amorphous structure of glass was preserved. BGCs were soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF) to evaluate their properties in vitro. After soaking in SBF for 1 day, precipitation of fiber structure was observed on the surface of the BGCs. After 2 and more days, the surface of the BGCs was completely covered with precipitates. The precipitates, identified as the apatite phase by XRD, contained carbonate and hydroxyl functional groups detected by Fourier transform IR reflection (FTIR) spectroscopy. After soaking for 16 days, a thin layer of about 10 FM, rich in calcium and phosphorus but poor in silicon, was observed on the surface of the BGCs. The composition of the Ca-P rich layer was consistent with the apatite structure identified by various methods, but the apatite layer was significantly thicker than reported in bulk form. The formation of an apatite phase surface has been suggested to be indicative of biocompatibility. All findings in this study indicated the formation of apatite on the surface of plasma-sprayed BGCs, and this material is expected to be biocompatible in vivo.","NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,TAINAN,TAIWAN; NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,CTR MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAINAN,TAIWAN",,,"Lee, Tzer-Min/G-3713-2011",,,,,31,35,39,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0257-8972,,,SURF COAT TECH,Surf.

The in-situ AFM observation has been carried out using a commercially available AFM instrument equipped with a fluid cell in the contact mode. An immunochemical technique was used to prepare the sample. The AFM imaging of the liposomes showed their balloon-like structures with apparent diameters of approximately 200-300 nm. These diameters are essentially in agreement with a mean size of 180 nm deduced from a previous dynamic light-scattering experiment, taking account of the well-known broadening phenomenon of lateral sizes in AFM images due to the tip-sample convolution. It is shown that the quality (contrast and/or reproducibility) of the AFM images depends both on the types of cantilever tips used and on the load forces at which the AFM tips were scanned over the sample. Based upon this, it is concluded that there is a certain critical contact pressure of a probe tip over the sample, which determines the quality of the sample image taken under water.","MITSUBISHI CHEM CORP,YOKOHAMA RES CTR,AOBA KU,YOKOHAMA,KANAGAWA 227,JAPAN; MITSUBISHI KASEI INST LIFE SCI,MACHIDA,TOKYO 194,JAPAN",,,,,,,,33,32,34,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0040-6090,,,THIN SOLID FILMS,Thin Solid Films,FEB,1996.0,273,1-2,,,,,297,303,,10.1016/0040-6090(95)07003-6,,,,7,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,UM534,WOS:A1996UM53400056,,,,,2019-02-25

The typical resonant frequency of the optical fiber cantilever was 25.6, while it was 29.5 kHz in the air. The Q factor of the cantilever depended on the vibration amplitude and showed typically 460-590 in the air and 65-270 in water. The relationship between the vibration amplitude and the average sample-probe separation indicated that the cantilever worked in the non-contact mode in water, while it worked in the cyclic-contact mode in the air.

The MEOnPC could polymerize with n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) in ethanol using a conventional radical polymerization technique. The unit mole fraction of MEOnPC in the polymer corresponded to that in the feed monomer solution. The MEOnPC polymers were soluble in ethanol, insoluble in water, but swelled in water and became hydrated. On the surface of a poly(BMA) membrane coated with MEOnPC, the phosphorylcholine groups of the MEOnPC unit present were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a fundamental evaluation for biomedical materials, adsorption of one of the plasma proteins, fibrinogen, on acrylic beads coated with the MEOnPC polymers was evaluated. The amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on the MEOnPC polymer was smaller than that on the original acrylic beads, poly(BMA) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The increase in the MEOnPC unit mole fraction in the polymer showed more effective protein adsorption-resistant properties.

The poly (beta-hydroxybutyrate-beta-hydroxyvalerate), a biopolymer considered as being biodegradable and biocompatible, has been recently introduced for orthopaedic biomaterials and regeneration pur poses. In our study, a PHB/9% HV polymer was transformed into 3D foams, then applied to the culture 3D of ovine chondrocytes (fibrous rings & growth plates) and osteoblasts (periostum). Sponges made ofbovine type I collagen were used as references. Orthopaedic cells were isolated, prepared and sown by simple injection to the geometrical center of the substrata, then incubated from 0 to 35 days by changing the culture medium all 4 days. Maximal densities were reached after 21 days: 18-24.10(6) cells/g for the chondrocytes, 8-10.10(6) cells/g for the osteoblasts. The cellular proliferation was more marked, with highest cell densities, for the collagen sponges. Laser confocal microscopy shows that the cellular diffusion take place throughout the entire volume of the porous artificial substrata.

In 1991, Allegheny General Hospital and Allegheny-Singer Research Institute purchased a centrifugal pump, then a 2-year-old technology, from Medtronic Bio-Medicus, as part of its research program for novel treatments of acute and chronic heart failure. During a 4-year development program, we then established and met goals of durability, performance, thromboresistance, and low cost. Methods. In vitro testing involved extensive hydraulic characterizations using Penn State mock loops. Calorimetry was used to determine efficiency. Durability studies used heated (37 degrees C) seawater for 28 to 45 days. In vivo studies used 46 sheep to test performance and engineering changes and to determine myocardial oxygen consumption, thromboresistance, and long-term durability. A left atrium-to-aorta circuit was used in all. Results. Hydraulic testing showed no preload sensitivity but moderate afterload sensitivity at all impeller speeds (2,000 to 6,000 rpm). The heat load was low, and overall efficiency was 13% to 15%. Bench durability studies showed no electrical malfunction of the stator or console without degradation of the biomaterials used. Acute in vitro studies showed a near-linear relationship of myocardial oxygen consumption and left ventricular stroke work, pump now, and pump speed. At speeds of 2 to 3 L/min (50% bypass), left ventricular stroke work and myocardial oxygen consumption were decreased approximately 50%. Additionally, 5 animals have had implants for 28 to 154 days with no macroemboli or microemboli detected in any animal. Hematologic and biochemical studies became normal 3 to 7 days after implantation. Hemolysis was low at less than 10 mg/dL. Clinical costs of the device are estimated to be 80% less than those of currently available devices. Conclusions. We conclude that an old technology has been made into new technology by application of sound engineering design principles, microchips, and new biomaterials.

The effectiveness of modifying the base polymer to achieve low protein adsorption is determined by the ability to drive the water soluble polymers to the surface and permanently anchoring it onto the base polymer surface.

In a clinical setting, endothelialization of a graft can be achieved using higher cell seeding densities, or by creating a surface on which EC can adhere and grow to confluence. But, human endothelial cells show little or no proliferation on the currently available graft materials. In this study, surface modification of PTFE and ePTFE by ammonia plasma treatment was carried out to enhance its interactions with ECM protein, EC growth factors, and with EC harvested from human umbilical vein (HUVEC), and from human saphenous veins (HSVEC). Our data shows that various vascular graft materials generated from ammonia plasma treated PTFE and ePTFE exhibited statistically significant improvements in HUVEC and HSVEC growth when compared to their respective controls (p values < 0.001). Growth of HSVEC on ammonia plasma treated ePTFE without ECM protein coating was also found to be statistically significant in comparison to that on fibronectin coated ePTFE (p < 0.001). The final HSVEC cell densities found on various ePTFE surfaces prepared from ammonia plasma treated ePTFE, suggests that transplantation of HSVEC monolayers on vascular prostheses can be established within clinically relevant times.

This important process, however, is known as poorly understood in the area in polymer science. One of the reasons is that the conventional method of examining the swelling process is often inconsistent. Since it has many important properties including non-invasiveness, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Micro-imaging has become a significant method of analyzing biomaterials as well as biological specimens [1,2]. In the present study, a time-dependent swelling process was observed non-invasively to investigate the polymeric swelling effect using NMR micro-imaging. The present study provides a noble and non-invasive method of measuring the degree of swelling as well as volumetric changes occurring in polymers immersed in liquid. The information obtained relates to both a water ingress process and volumetric changes of polymer specimens. This proposed method also will provide more reliable techniques to ascertain the time-dependent swelling process than the other conventional methods. One of the important aspects of the present study is that the proposed method is a non-invasive technique and is also capable of ascertaining the time-dependent process of the swelling.

The intrinsic nature of these biomaterials renders them suitable for applications where temporally slow releases of bioactive agents in situ may be required. They are also desirable as fixation devices of bone, because they can virtually eliminate osteopenia associated with stress shielding or additional surgery. The majority of currently available sterilization techniques are not suitable for these thermoplastic materials and it may be desirable to develop new sterilization standards, which can account for the special character of PLA-PGA materials. Biocompatibility and toxicity studies suggest that, overall, PLA-PGA biomaterials may be suitable for orthopaedic applications, although certain problems, especially pertaining to reduction in cell proliferation, have been reported. Clinical applications are also promising, albeit not without problems usually associated with transient tissue inflammation. The future of these materials appears bright, especially in soft tissues.

This computational tool uses cellular automata and parallel iterations to model and simulate the release of bioactive agents (drugs) from bioerodible matrices. The simulations can accurately model surface erosion processes in multicomponent systems of arbitrary geometry and with different dissolution rates for each component. Simulation results are analysed to show how the overall release rates are affected by the intrinsic dissolution rates, drug loading, porosity and the dispersion of the drug in the bioerodible matrix. A strongly non-linear dependence of release rates on drug loading and the intrinsic dissolution rates of the solid components is obtained and the effects of phase dispersion on the variability of release rates are elucidated. Finally, guidelines are presented for screening of alternatives to minimize the development effort and experimentation required for designing devices with desired release characteristics.","RICE UNIV,INST BIOSCI & BIOTECHNOL,HOUSTON,TX 77251; UNIV HOUSTON,DEPT ELECT & COMP ENGN,HOUSTON,TX 77204","Zygourakis, K (reprint author), RICE UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,HOUSTON,TX 77251, USA.",,,"Zygourakis, Kyriacos/0000-0002-1044-1139",,,,24,75,84,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JAN,1996.0,17,2,,,,,125,135,,10.1016/0142-9612(96)85757-7,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,TY458,WOS:A1996TY45800006,8624389.0,,,,2019-02-25

For comparison, samples were simply adsorbed with protein. The three derivatization schemes resulted in different patterns and levels of activity. Tresyl chloride was not effective in immobilizing active enzyme on Co-Cr-Mo. Aqueous silanization with 12.5% APS resulted in optimal immobilized activity. Activity on samples derivatized with 0.65 mg p-NPC cm(-2) was four to five times greater than that on samples simply adsorbed with enzyme or optimally derivatized with APS and was about eight times that on tresylated samples.

Emphasis was put on quality interactions between physical and biological properties of the material to be dried and freeze drying process parameters. Qualitative estimations of the following properties of biomaterials: a) colour, b) suppleness to caking and c) suppleness to scraping from the hot surface in dependence with the process parameters were performed using four-step subjective scales. On the basis of this estimations a synthetic quality criterion SQC was defined whose numerical value reflects general product quality. The results of mathematical modelling, numerical solution of the model and comparison with experimental data indicated that the process was heat transfer controlled and that the main factors resulting in good product quality and high SQC are low temperature of the conductive heated surface and vacuum chamber pressure affecting sublimation temperature.

As a consequence, dried biomaterials demand will rise and equipments will have to be built or redesigned to accommodate changes. The design and innovations on industrial dryers require fundamental knowledge conceived in laboratory units. The new heat pump dryer operates at a wide relative humidity and the air temperature is adjustable from -20 to 100 degrees C. Above and below freezing point drying modes are done in the same plant which allows the control of biomaterial properties. The technique consists of two stages, unbound weakly held water removal by freeze drying, and tightly bound moisture desorption by medium temperature drying. The fluidized and shelf heat pump dryers have the required features to dry heat sensitive biomaterials. The dryers were built and extensive research on biomaterials has been conducted at The Norwegian Institute of Technology. Many experiments were done on effect of heat pump drying conditions on enzyme and biological active bacteria solutions, fruits, cod fish, fish feed and shrimps. At optimum heat drying conditions, the bacteria Rhodococcus reached 100% viability and dried biomolecules attained full biological activity. The heat pump dryer allowed adjustment of the biomaterial properties and quality according to its phase, shape and size. Dried samples showed improvements on survival rate, rehydration, colour, hardness and mono-multimolecular sorption isotherms over poorly dried products. Beneficial results were achieved for nearly all tests.

The scleroprotein patch (n = 4) was resorbed too soon, and in 2 dogs the unstitched collagen patches became unglued; biliary leakage was the result in both instances.

Sterilization of food materials by high pressure treatment at relatively low temperatures has been intensively investigated with promising results. Microbial spore sterilization by adiabatic expansion of water pressurized to over 600 MPa has been demonstrated. The sterilization of Bacillus stearothermophilus spores has been achieved by six consecutive adiabatic expansion cycles at temperatures below 70 degrees C. Twin-screw extrusion has been successfully applied to destroy allergens in proteinaceous food and feed materials such as soy flour, but could not be demonstrated with soybean. hulls of high carbohydrate content. It has been shown that allergens of buckwheat and soy pours can be partially destroyed by high shear using twin-screw extrusion cooking. Microparticulation technology using a jet mill has been employed to increase the surface hydrophobicity of proteinaceous particles milled to less than 3 mu m in diameter in order to prepare fat replacers Biodegradable loose fill packing, material has been prepared from corn starch by extrusion cooking. An extrudate prepared with high amylose (70 g/100g) starch containing about 9 g/100g of polyvinyl alcohol and 9 g/100g moisture was shown to be a high quality biodegradable, shock absorbing packing material. The biodegradable packing fill obtained also had a good bulk density, elasticity and compressibility. Clearly novel mechanical methodologies such as high pressure, high shear, and microparticulation techniques offer great potential in food and feed processing, and in the production of environmentally friendly, biodegradable packing materials.","HELSINKI UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BIOTECHNOL & FOOD ENGN LAB,FIN-02150 ESPOO,FINLAND","Hayakawa, I (reprint author), KYUSHU UNIV,FAC AGR,DEPT FOOD SCI & TECHNOL,HIGASHI KU,10-1 6 CHOME,FUKUOKA 812,JAPAN.",,,,,,,59,3,3,1,13,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 7DX",0023-6438,,,FOOD SCI TECHNOL-LEB,Food Sci.

This review discusses several critical controversies in this field and lay special emphasis on the cellular and biochemical reactions related to the formation mechanisms of lipofuscin, ceroid, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and age pigment-like fluorophores (APFs). Various amino compounds and their reaction with secondary aldehydic products of oxygen free radical-induced oxidation, particularly lipid peroxidation, are important sources of the fluorophores of ceroid/lipofuscin, which progressively accumulate as a result of phagocytosis and autophagocytosis of modified biomaterials within secondary lysosomes of postmitotic and other cells. Lipofuscin is the classical age pigment of postmitotic cells, while ceroid accumulates due to pathologic and experimental processes. There are good reasons to consider both ceroid and lipofuscin as materials of the same principal origin. The age-related intracellular fluorophores of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seems to represent a special class of lipofuscin, which partly contains derivatives of retinoids and carotenoids. Saccharide-originated fluorophores, principally AGEs formed during glycation/Maillard reactions, may be mainly responsible for the extracellular fluorescence of long-lived proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and lens crystalline. Although lipofuscin, ceroid, AGEs, and APFs can be produced from different types of biological materials due to different side reactions of essential biology, the crosslinking of carbonyl-amino compounds is recognized as a common process during their formation.",,"Yin, DZ (reprint author), LINKOPING UNIV, DEPT PATHOL, S-58185 LINKOPING, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,187,284,314,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0891-5849,1873-4596,,FREE RADICAL BIO MED,Free Radic.

These compliant layered cups must also exhibit considerable rigidity to resist the pinching action of the acetabulum during normal gait, especially in cases where the subchondral bone is removed during insertion. Hence, a stiff cup backing is required to compensate for the rigidity lost when using the soft layer. During normal loading conditions two areas of mechanical failure exist within the cup. Firstly, delamination due to varied material stiffness and secondly, loosening due to excess stresses at the cement or cup/bone interface. Also, adverse conditions may arise following periods of prolonged static loading, where the fluid film may break down allowing the articulating surfaces to come into direct asperity contact, resulting in higher frictional coefficients. In this study the stress analysis was performed using the finite element method. A 2D FE model of a pelvic slice was used to evaluate stress distributions in the cement layer and immediate surrounding bone for various cup stiffnesses. While, a 3D finite element model was used to analyse the effects of both friction and aspect ratio upon the stress distribution within the elastomeric layer Results obtained correlated well with established mathematical and/or FEA predictions The validity of both mathematical and FEA predicted results for the compliant layer stress analysis was assessed using experimentally obtained reaction forces and displacements. Although further work is currently being carried out to achieve the optimum cup design, a cup configuration to reduce both the cup and pelvic stresses was established and analysed using material properties typical of available biomaterials.",,"Bryan, KJ (reprint author), UNIV LIMERICK,DEPT MAT SCI & TECHNOL,LIMERICK,IRELAND.",,"Irish Centre for Composites, Research (ICOMP)/D-4887-2011",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS,CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE,"EINERSBERGER BLICK 28, PO BOX 266, W-3392 CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE, GERMANY",1013-9826,,0-87849-723-4,KEY ENG MAT,,,1996.0,118-,,,,,,347,354,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.118-119.347,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Materials Science,BF75N,WOS:A1996BF75N00040,,,,,2019-02-25

In particular, it demonstrates that macroscopic images ('stains'), that assess the spatial distribution of albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, and HMK (high molecular weight kininogen), can be obtained over areas of at least 12 cm(2) using immunospecific adhesion of dyed polystyrene beads. Stain intensities, measured with a scanner and an image analysis system, were found to quantify the amount of specific protein in the solution used to coat the surfaces. Results obtained with the proposed method produced single protein isotherms for albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fibrinogen that followed Langmuir-like adsorption behavior and were similar to previously published isotherms. The HMK isotherm also exhibited Langmuir-like adsorption behavior. The proposed method also detected the presence of an expected maximum in the adsorption of fibrinogen onto glass as a function of plasma dilution. Adsorption of fibrinogen out of 6.4% plasma onto glass from a separated flow produced results indicating the quantity as well as the location of fibrinogen at the boundary of the separated region.

The amount of proteins adsorbed on the PC-polymer from human plasma was smaller than that on not only the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) but also the OH-polymer and MeO-polymer. The PC group could weaken the interaction between plasma proteins and polymer surfaces. The amount of adsorbed proteins on the PC-polymer decreased with an increase in the mole fraction of the PC units in the polymers. We could observe an effect of the oxyethylene chain length (n is the number of repeating units of oxyethylene) on protein adsorption between n=2 and n=3. The platelet adhesion on these polymer surfaces was evaluated using rabbit platelet-rich plasma. On the polymers without the PC group, that is, poly(BMA), OH-polymer, and MeO-polymer, many platelets adhered and a considerable shape change in the adherent platelets occurred. On the other hand, the PC-polymers could effectively suppress platelet adhesion. The platelet adhesion behavior on the polymers was strongly dependent on the adsorbed proteins. Platelet adhesion was completely inhibited on all of the PC-polymers studied having a 0.3 PC unit mole fraction.

The total amount of proteins adsorbed on the polymer surface from human plasma was determined, and the distribution of adsorbed proteins on the plasma-contacting surface was analyzed. The amount of proteins adsorbed on every poly(MAPC-co-BMA) was small compared with that observed on polymers without the phospholipid polar group. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of adsorbed proteins on the poly(MAPC-co-BMA) even when the methylene chain length between the phospholipid polar group and the backbone in the MAPC moiety was altered. Platelet adhesion on the polymer surface from a platelet suspension in a buffered solution was evaluated with and without plasma treatment on the surface. When a rabbit platelet suspension was brought into contact with the poly(BMA) surface after treatment with plasma, many platelets adhered and aggregated. However, a reduced amount of platelet adhered on the poly(BMA) was found in the case of direct contact with the platelet suspension. On the other hand, the poly(MAPC-co-BMA)s could inhibit platelet adhesion under both conditions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the proteins adsorbed on the surface play an important role in determining the platelet adhesion and suppression of the protein adsorption on the surface, which is one of the most significant ways of inhibiting platelet adhesion.","TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN; NIHON UNIV,COLL SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT IND CHEM,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN",,,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,40,48,50,0,9,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Other changes in adsorbed fibrinogen such as decreases in polyclonal antibody binding and SDS elutability supported the conclusion that fibrinogen undergoes postadsorptive conformational changes. Subsequently we measured the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the three putative platelet binding sites on fibrinogen, using a single mid-range concentration of antibody. We found that binding of a monoclonal antibody to the platelet binding site at the C-terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen changed little with residence time, while binding of monoclonal antibodies to the other two putative binding sites on fibrinogen either increased with residence time (RGDF at A alpha 95-98), or first increased and then decreased with residence time (RGDS at A alpha 572-575). In the current study, we measured antibody binding affinity, K-a, by measuring antibody binding at a series of antibody concentrations. This is a more sensitive method for detecting changes in adsorbed fibrinogen than measuring antibody binding from a single antibody concentration. The K-a was determined for two antibodies, M1 (4A5), which binds to a platelet binding domain of fibrinogen (gamma 402-411) and R1 (155 B1616), which binds to residues 87-100 of the A alpha chain (containing an RGDF site). A summary of the results for the M1 antibody are as follows. The K-a was higher for M1 binding to fibrinogen adsorbed to Immulon I(R) than to Biomer(R), Biospan(R) or poly(ethylene terephthalate), suggesting that fibrinogen adsorbed to Immulon I(R) is more platelet adhesive than fibrinogen adsorbed to the other polymers. On Biospan(R), the K-a decreased from 2.8 x 10(9) to 1.0 x 10(9) M(-1) after a 24 h 37 degrees C residence time, which correlated with the decrease in platelet adhesiveness of adsorbed fibrinogen observed previously under these conditions. The change in K-a was greater when adsorbed fibrinogen was kept under denaturing conditions. For example, the K-a decreased from 2.8 x 10(9) to 0.8 x 10(9) M(-1) after a 1 h 70 degrees C residence time whereas it remained approximately the same, 2.9 x 10(9) M(-1), after a 24 h 0 degrees C residence time.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT CHEM ENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; CHENGDU UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT POLYMER SCI,CHENGDU 610065,SICHUAN,PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL19419],,,37,26,26,0,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The immobilization of PEO was carried out with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in aqueous media. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain a maximal coupling of PEG. The degree of coupling was determined by the surface concentration of amino groups. The maximal surface concentrations of amino groups were close to what is expected for a complete coverage of the surface with PEG. Adsorption of albumin from a buffer solution onto PEG-containing surfaces was about 85% less than the albumin uptake by unmodified polystyrene latices. Protein adsorption from plasma dilutions was lower on surfaces containing PEO molecules with a higher molecular weight. The reduction of the protein uptake from plasma by surfaces containing PEO-3400 molecules was only 40% compared to the adsorption to unmodified surfaces. These results indicate that plasma proteins have a low affinity for surfaces modified with PEO. However the PEO modified surfaces are by no means 'protein resistant' when exposed to plasma.","UNIV TWENTE,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BIOMAT SECT,NL-7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS; UNIV TWENTE,INST BIOMED TECHNOL,NL-7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,33,18,18,2,10,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The sulfur/carbon (S/C) atomic composition ratio increased from 0.03 to 0.08 when the bulk dextran sulfate concentration used for modification was increased from 2.5 to 10 mg ml(-1). The permeability of urea and creatinine did not change significantly upon modification with heparin or dextran sulfate. Surface modification, however, did decrease the permeability coefficients of glucose, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-12. Unlike Cuprophan, chitosan and surface-modified chitosan membranes did not significantly activate the complement system as measured by the serum iC3b concentration. Compared to forty and sixty fully-activated platelets present on control surfaces, surface modification with heparin and dextran sulfate significantly reduced the number of adherent platelets per 25000 mu m(2) area and the extent of platelet activation. Surface modification with anionic polysaccharides, however, did significantly shorten the plasma recalcification time leading to fibrin clot formation.

In previous investigations we have demonstrated that hydrophilic materials bind preadsorbed fibronectin that can easily be reorganized by fibroblasts in a specific matrix-like structure, while on less wettable materials (possessing water contact angles above 60 deg) the cells were unable to do this. As the cells continuously produce their fibronectin matrix, we tried in this study to answer the question of how the surface wettability of biomaterials influences the endogenous fibronectin matrix formation and its subsequent organization on the substrate. We cultured fibroblasts for 72 h on five different wettable surfaces: glass, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, pellethane, polyvinylchloride, and silicone, with water-contact angles gradually ranging from 25 to 105 deg. We demonstrated that the decreasing wettability of the materials significantly reduced endogenous fibronectin deposition on the substratum. Moreover, fibrillar organization of fibronectin appeared only on relatively hydrophilic glass and APS substrate, while on more hydrophobic materials like PVC and SI, cells secreted some fibronectin but were not able to organize it into a fibronectin matrix. These results were correlated with an altered cell morphology and spreading on these materials. In addition, an ELISA method has been implemented to quantify fibronectin matrix formation as a possible measure of the biocompatibility of materials, where a clear relation has been found between fibroblast growth and fibronectin matrix formation.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,INST CHEM,DEPT MEMBRANE RES,D-14513 TELTOW,GERMANY","Altankov, G (reprint author), BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,INST BIOPHYS,STR ACAD G BONCHEV,BL 21,SOFIA 1113,BULGARIA.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,34,39,44,1,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Coral is a natural product, the interest of which we have already demonstrated in our previous work. Following sterilization, natural coral was implanted in sheep femurs. We regularly extracted the implants from the femurs to study the kinetics of elemental mineral transformation of the bone substitutes. For the first time ever, and thanks to the PIXE method (particles induced X-ray emission), we were able to measure the concentration of mineral elements at different time intervals after implantation over a whole cross-section. We found a discontinuity of the mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Fe) at the interface between the implant and the receiver. This shows that the osseous attack is not global but, on the contrary, centripetal. Moreover, the fit of the concentration time course indicates that the kinetics of ossification are different for each atomic element and characterize a distinct biological phenomenon. Our analyses confirm the biocompatibility and the ossification of the implanted coral.","UNIV CLERMONT FERRAND,F-63177 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE; IPNE,B-4000 LIEGE,BELGIUM; ATOM ENERGY ORG IRAN,TEHRAN,IRAN; HOP HOTEL DIEU,SERV CHIRURG INFANTILE,F-63000 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE","Irigaray, JL (reprint author), CNRS,IN2P3,LAB PHYS CORPUSULAIRE CLERMONT FERRAND,F-63177 CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE.",,,,,,,9,8,8,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

This study shows that surface hydrophilization is not sufficient for prevention of platelet adhesion and activation.

To further explore the effects of this premature activation, we evaluated the supernatants of biomaterial associated neutrophils to determine whether soluble mediators were released, and the likely role of these mediators. We show that these supernatants contain a chemoattractant and thereby induce chemotaxis by fresh neutrophils. No evidence of enhanced oxidative free radical production by either unstimulated neutrophils or a primed response to other mediators occurs when neutrophils were incubated with these supernatants. We also examined the effect of adding fresh neutrophils to a biomaterial surface containing a previous inoculum of neutrophils, and observed that the fresh cells did not become stimulated to release reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and also exhibited impaired killing of staphylococci. These studies suggest that not only does the biomaterial surface activate the initial wave of neutrophils but that subsequent waves of neutrophils exhibit an impaired host-defense function. These results are consistent with the known impairment of host defense in the presence of biomaterials, and provide evidence for a long-term down-regulation of neutrophil function at biomaterial surfaces.

A foreign-body reaction was the characteristic host tissue response against the implants. The resorption of the implanted materials was analyzed by measuring both the weight and the collagen persistences. This last was measured by using (C-14)acetylated collagen, which was revealed to be not modified upon radioactive labeling, in terms of its ability to form a complex with sepiolite. The persistence of the implants is controllable by treatment of the collagen component with glutaraldehyde. Thus, for 1% glutaraldehyde-treated collagen complexes, 100% of persistence was observed after several months of implantation, this value decreasing to a few days for nontreated collagen samples. The collagen-sepiolite complex showed a low immunological response, almost null for 1% glutaraldehyde-treated collagen complexes, which was analyzed by measuring anti-collagen antibodies levels. Based on the performed studies, sepiolite-collagen complexes can be considered a resorbable material.

The mechanisms whereby the implant surface may elicit and modulate leukocyte functions in vivo are not understood, partly due to the technical difficulties of examining the local inflammatory events in vicinity of the material-tissue interface with conventional biochemical and immunological techniques. In the present study a newly developed biplate implant was inserted subcutaneously in the mouse. Leukocytes from the local inflammatory exudate and leukocytes associated to the surface of the implants were retrieved after 1 and 6 days and separately assayed with respect to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production ex vivo. Implantation caused a local accumulation of predominantly mononuclear cells in the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. The H2O2 production was found to be low in both the subcutaneous exudate and the implant-associated leukocytes, irrespective of implant material and implantation times. However, ex vivo-stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused an enhanced H2O2, production. These observations show that biplate implants do not maximally activate the oxidative metabolism of the recruited leukocytes. The exudate leukocytes were more responsive to PMA stimulation in comparison with implant-associated leukocytes, indicating that properties of the implant surface and possibly surface-associated proteins could modify the responsiveness of the phagocytic cells at the implant site. Our results suggest that the present biplate model may be suitable for further studies on local production of oxygen metabolites and function of leukocytes at implanted biomaterials.

The large pores in the interior of these beads provide space for cell growth. However, it has been observed that the cell distribution in the interior of microcarriers is often uneven. In some cases, the pores appear to be unoccupied. Questions thus arise as to whether all pores are open to the bead surface, and whether the pores allow cell entry and proliferation. To examine the accessibility and geometrical features of the pores, laser scanning confocal microscope was used to optically section fluorescein isothiocyanate stained microcarriers. Three dimensional images were reconstructed by combining the sections for examination of the openness as well as the connectivity of the pores. By employing image processing software, the solid structure of the beads was removed from reconstructed three dimensional images to allow for direct visualization of the pores. A wide variety of geometries was observed; some pores were interconnected while others were segregated from each other. It was observed that while many pores were open to the surface through sufficiently large channels for cell entrance, a large number of pores was also either closed to the exterior or accessed the surface only through constricted channels which might impede cell entry. This confocal microscopic technique for direct evaluation of pore structure of macroporous beads is noninvasive and requires minimal sample preparation. It can easily be adapted for in situ observation of cell behavior as well as find application for structural assessment for various biomaterials.","UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT CHEM ENGN & MAT SCI,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455",,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,0,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

Beyond its immediate problems for the patients, the crisis has also discredited the use of silicone rubber as one of the most widely used biomaterials. Silicone elastomer or gel, the primary material in mammary prostheses, may be exposed to the body's tissues via envelope rupture, gel bleed, or elastomer fragmentation. Local responses to silicone include granulomatous inflammation, capsular contraction, and infection, all in varying degrees depending on ill-defined factors, which may include patient condition, peri- and postoperative complications, and hereditary predisposition, as well as material properties such as surface texture. The theory that silicone breast implants cause immunological disorders has not been proven. However, further study is necessary because some patients report autoimmune-like disorders (human adjuvant disease) following implant placement. Like autoimmune disease, human adjuvant disease is characterized by abnormalities of the immune response, autoantibody formation, and chronic inflammation. Silicone has been shown to play the role of an adjuvant, providing constant nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. Some researchers have hypothesized the role of silicone in specific immune reactions, including immunoglobulin formation and T-cell activation. This report examines the role of silicone as an agent of disease, focusing on material surface-tissue interactions.","CLEMSON UNIV, DEPT BIOENGN, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA; UNIV S CAROLINA, SCH MED, DEPT SURG, COLUMBIA, SC USA",,,,,,,,48,16,18,0,2,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Cement granulomas, micron-sized polyethylene particles-induced giant-celled granulomas, sheets of submicron-sized polyethylene particles-laden macrophages, and aggregated, metallic particles-laden macrophages were scattered in the fibrous tissue of all interfacial membranes. Quantitatively, characteristics of the interfacial membranes of the two groups differed from one another. The dominant species of prosthetic debris in the interfacial membranes of the short-term surviving joint replacements was derived from the polyethylene acetabular socket, and, correspondingly, giant-celled granulomas and macrophagic sheets predominated. Metallic particles and the macrophagic reaction thereto dominated in the interfacial membranes of the long-term surviving arthroplasties, and large cement and polyethylene chunks typically were incorporated in the fibrous tissue of the membranes without an accompanying macrophagic response. In long-term surviving hip arthroplasties, metallic particles may be at least as important as polymeric detritus in stimulating the formation of the bone-resorbing, granulomatous interfacial membrane, which is the hallmark of aseptically loosened arthroplasties. Differences in mechanical settings may account for unlike modes and rates of generation of prosthetic breakdown products, explaining the disparate survivorship of different patients' artificial joints.","BNAI ZION MED CTR, ASSOC PATIENTS IMPLANTED JOINTS, CTR IMPLANT SURG, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL","Boss, JH (reprint author), BNAI ZION MED CTR, ASSOC PATIENTS IMPLANTED JOINTS, DEPT PATHOL, POB 4940, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL.",,,,,,,78,10,10,0,3,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Thus, jaw bone cells grown on hydroxylapatite proliferated very little, while expressing discrete levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and of osteocalcin secretion into the growth medium. On the other hand, bone cells seeded onto titanium surfaces proliferated much more intensely than those on Thermanox(R), besides expressing alkaline phosphatase (very intensely after 5 days) and secreting osteocalcin. Thus, both kinds of titanium surfaces greatly enlarged the size of both populations of preosteoblastic precursors and of pre-osteoblasts in vitro, but plasma-sprayed titanium surfaces elicited, between day 2 and 5 in culture, greater increases in bone cell numbers markedly enhancing their proliferative and alkaline phosphatase activities, along with their osteocalcin secretion into the growth medium, and thus favouring the expression of the mature osteoblastic phenotype. These preliminary findings show that studies correlating the physical surface features of various biomaterials with the corresponding expression of specific differentiation markers by the bone cells cultured on these same surfaces can provide information relevant to the clinical application of biomaterials.","UNIV VERONA,SCH MED,INST ANAT & HISTOL,I-37134 VERONA,ITALY; AO ASIF,RES INST,CH-7270 DAVOS,SWITZERLAND; UNIV CLIN BERN,DEPT ORTHOPAED,CH-3010 BERN,SWITZERLAND","DeSantis, D (reprint author), UNIV VERONA,SCH MED,DEPT DENT,I-37134 VERONA,ITALY.",,"Richards, Robert/I-8235-2015","Richards, Robert/0000-0002-7778-2480; DE SANTIS, Daniele/0000-0001-7664-5911",,,,16,50,50,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Polyaddition was conducted for the syntheses of a series of copolyetherurethaneureas [PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III] grafted on the copolymer of MPC and BMA with the molar ratio of 0.1:0.9:2:1 for Mac(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III:polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF):4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (DPMDI):ethylene diamine. Parent polyetherurethaneurea (PEU) and poly(butyl methacrylate) graft copolyetherurethaneurea (PEU-g-PBMA) were also prepared. XPS spectra indicated that the MPC unit is located on the surface of PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III. The measurements of equilibrium water content and contact angle to water confirmed that the higher molecular weight of side chains results in higher hydrophilicity of PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III surface. The tensile modulus showed values of E=13.3 similar to 38.4 MPa for PEU-g-P(MPC/BMA)-I similar to III films.

Two strategies are currently in use to achieve the goal of new blood compatible polymers: Firstly, existing cellulosic membranes are modified by introducing functional groups through ether and ester bonds and secondly, synthetic polymers are mixed with bull additives or copolymerized with other polymers. Biological responses as a consequence of blood/material interaction are common observations. However, blood compatibility in general cannot be improved by a single membrane surface feature. The assessment of a series of surface properties shows that physiological defense systems, like complement and cell activation, or coagulation are differently stimulated by means of the same surface structures of biomaterials. Thus, a compromise has to be found, already during membrane development. We synthetized a series of modifications of cellulosic membranes with the aim to investigate whether the type of substituent and its degree of substitution has an influence on the blood compatibility of these dialysis membranes. Data indicate that alterations in the lipophilic/hydrophilic balance (HLB) on the polymer surface may explain substituent-related changes in haemocompatibility. Optimal degrees of substitution are characteristic for a given type of substituent and enables the membrane manufacturer to tailor materials for improved blood compatibility.","AKZO NOBEL FASER AG,MEMBRANA,WUPPERTAL,GERMANY",,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,2,HUTHIG & WEPF VERLAG,BASEL,"AUF DEM WOLF 4 FX#001-41-61-317-94-11, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

To increase this knowledge the modification of polymer surfaces, their characterization, and the investigation of the response of the biosystem is considered to be a suitable approach. Surface modification may be performed in the wet-chemical way (heterogeneous reaction) or by means of treatment with a suitable plasma (glow discharge). Surface sensitive methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflexion mode as well as surface energy measurements are useful for surface characterization. To determine the bioresponse to the polymer surface, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, cell growth and full blood tests may be used. In the present paper several systems are described with respect to their surface modification, characterization, and bioresponse. It is shown that the protein adsorption is triggered by the surface, that SO2 plasma treatment enhances cell growth and that there seems to be a biocompatibility window for a surface characterized by a zeta-potential between -4 and -8 mV and a ratio of dispersive to polar contributions of surface energy around 12. It is stressed, however, that the final solution for a biomaterial is a material which, in the course of degradation, constantly presents a new biocompatible surface.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,DEUTSCH WOLLFORSCHUNGSINST,D-52062 AACHEN,GERMANY","Hocker, H (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,LEHRSTUHL TEXT CHEM & MAKROMOLEK CHEM,VELTMANPL 8,D-52062 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,8,5,5,0,3,HUTHIG & WEPF VERLAG,BASEL,"AUF DEM WOLF 4 FX#001-41-61-317-94-11, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

The metallographic analysis showed that the nitrogen content had little effect on the grain size. When the nitrogen content in the alloy was increased, the formation of finer carbides of the M(6)C type was promoted ahead of the M(23)C(6) type.

In vitro, rGM-CSF restored the anti-bacterial potency of the phagocytes, which had been reduced by surface contact with H-PE, The results suggest that modification of biomaterials with rGM-CSF could be one way of preventing staphylococcal infections; especially in neutropenic disorders, which constitute the highest risk factor for foreign body-associated infections.","UNIV LODZ,INST MICROBIOL & IMMUNOL,DEPT INFECT BIOL,PL-90237 LODZ,POLAND; LUND UNIV,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,2,CENTER ACADEMIC PUBL JAPAN,TOKYO,"4-16 YAYOI 2-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN",0385-5600,,,MICROBIOL IMMUNOL,Microbiol.

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, AN69(R)) dialysis membranes have been shown to improve the outcome of critically ill patients. Factor D is an essential enzyme of the alternative pathway of complement and is increased during renal failure. On the other hand the contact of blood with biomaterials activates the complement cascade through the alternative pathway. PAN filters adsorb factor D which looses its enzymatic activity whilst bound to the membrane [1]; the complement alternative pathway function of serum exposed to PAN filters is greatly diminished and restored after addition of purified factor D [1]. The aim of our study was to measure the time course of factor D adsorption and its blood concentration during CVVH in critically ill patients with acute renal failure. Methods. We studied seven critically ill patients with ARF before, during and after continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) with AN69. Results. There was a rapid decrease of factor D levels to 62(+/-6%) of the pre-CVVH value during the first 2 h, which continued to 51(+/-7.3%) after 12 h; at 24 h there was a slight rise to 62+/-12%. Sequential use of Polyacrylonitrile (AN69(R)) filters lowered factor D levels below the normal plasma concentration in three patients, thus producing a state of factor D depletion. Conclusion. The significant reduction of factor D levels during CVVH with PAN filters suggests that frequent changes of PAN filters may reduce alternative pathway function by lowering factor D levels. CVVH (as opposed to intermittent dialysis) with PAN membranes may further improve the outcome of critically ill patients.","UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT ANAESTHESIOL,DIV SURG INTENS CARE,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND; UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT MED,DIV NEPHROL,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND; UNIV GENEVA,HOP CANTONAL,DEPT MED,DIV MED INTENS CARE,CH-1211 GENEVA,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,10,48,50,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0931-0509,,,NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL,Nephrol.

Recently we have studied the interaction of picosecond and femtosecond laser radiation in the visible region of the spectrum with synthetic polymer films and we have compared these studies with our similar studies nab nanosecond duration laser radiation. Biocompatible polymers have been extensively used for sutures, vascular grafts or bone and other hard tissue replacements. The use of surgical lasers for intervention on biocompatible material - tissue interfaces has attracted a great deal of interest, as both the high intensity, short pulse duration lasers and the prosthetic biomaterials are in increasing use. Our recent ablation studies, using ultrashort laser pulses, of biocompatible materials, are described in this article. Lasers were introduced in medical research in the early sixties but the laser beam ability to remove efficiently and safely soft or hard tissue, the lateral thermal damage and the final surface characteristics are still under investigation In the past few years, pulse mid-infrared lasers have attracted much attention because they operate at wavelengths where soft or hard tissue, try virtue of their water or water and hydroxyapatite content respectively, exhibit strong absorption restricting residual thermal damage to a relatively small zone. Recently we have investigated the interaction of short pulse laser radiation of picosecond and femtosecond duration with soft and hard tissue, as this unexplored field is expected to be a potential alternative in powerful laser processing of biomedical structures. The experimental results obtained, including ablation rates, ablation wavelength dependence, pulse duration dependence, fluence dependence, etc. are presented These results are discussed according to simple theoretical models of laser energy absorption and the possible mechanisms of ultrashort pulse laser ablation, which in some cases involves multiphoton photodissociation processes.

The material could be used, much as a bone graft, as material itself resorbs or dissolves as bone growth occurs, and end result is new remolded bone. Ca2P2O7 is one of intermediate product of bone mineralized crystal from amorphous calcium phosphates. The Ca2P2O7 doped with certain amount of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was prepared as the developed material. In this study, the Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O was used for liquid phase sintering additive which was expected to improve sintering process and promote physiological bioresorbability. Compressive strength and 4-point bending strength were measured by Bionix test system 858. At the beginning, the mechanical strength was proportionally increasing with the addition of Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O up to 5 wt%, but thereafter decreased The microstructure and crystalline identification was analyzed by the techniques of SEM, EPMA, TEM and XRD. The relationship between mechanical strength of the sintered bioceramics and Na4P2O7 . 10H(2)O dopant was in terms of the presence of NaCa(PO3)(3), grain growth and abnormal grain coalescence while dopant increased. Preliminary in-vivo evaluation was studied by rabbit femur condyle implantation model. There was no inflammation or any toxic sign during the experimental period. The histological section of intraosseous implantation revealed that the new bone directly deposited on the surface of the material at the 4th week after operation. The materials were gradually decreasing in volume and being replaced by the surrounding regenerated bone in the rabbit condyle in-vivo environment. The results was encouraged us to conclude that the developed material did have a great potential as an ideal biodegradable bone substitute.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED,TAIPEI,TAIWAN","Lin, FH (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,COLL MED,CTR BIOMED ENGN,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.",,"Lin, Feng-Huei/E-3970-2010",,,,,25,0,1,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS,CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE,"EINERSBERGER BLICK 28, PO BOX 266, W-3392 CLAUSTHAL ZELLERFE, GERMANY",1013-9826,,,KEY ENG MAT,,,1996.0,115,,,,,,191,208,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.115.191,,,,18,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science,BE83H,WOS:A1996BE83H00013,,,,,2019-02-25

However, in the as-cast condition these alloys are relatively brittle due to the precipitation of interdendritic carbide phases, a-phase, and gas porosity. Furthermore, the carbon content has to be kept to a minimum for optimum alloy performance under wear conditions (such as in applications for prosthetic devices). Hence, in this work the effect of carbon content and heat treating on the exhibited mechanical properties was investigated. For this purpose three alloys (0.05, 0.16, and 0.31% C) were fabricated by remelting a commercial ASTM-F75 alloy under an inert environment followed by casting cylindrical bars of 13.5 mm diameter by 250 mm in length. The heat treatments consisted of annealing at 1250 degrees C for four hours followed by furnace cooling and/or water quenching. It was found that the alloy strength is not severely affected by the carbon content. In particular, the 0.05% C alloy exhibits a strain hardening behaviour which suggests an FCC to HCP strain induced martensitic transformation. At higher carbon contents the extent of the transformation is drastically reduced, probably due to the presence of significant second phase precipitates. In addition, relatively slow cooling rates seem to hinder the extent of the strain induced transformation.","CONVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estud Avanzados, Unidad Saltillo, Saltillo 25900, Coahuila, Mexico","Salinas-Rodriguez, A (reprint author), CONVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estud Avanzados, Unidad Saltillo, Km 13 Carr, Saltillo 25900, Coahuila, Mexico.",,,,,,,14,3,3,0,0,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-349-X,,,,1996.0,,,,,,,69,79,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM42Z,WOS:000078691600005,,,,,2019-02-25

Metal replicas make near ideal samples for STM in comparison to the original biological materials. Modifications include a 0.1 mu m backing layer of silver and mounting the replicas on a fine-mesh silver filters to enhance the rigidity of the metal replica. This is required unless STM imaging is carried out in vacuum; otherwise, a liquid film of contamination physically connects the STM tip with the sample. This mechanical coupling leads to exaggerated height measurements; the enhanced rigidity of the thicker replica eliminates much of the height amplification. Further improvement was obtained by imaging in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Calibration and reproducibility were tested with replicas of well characterized bilayers of cadmium arachidate on mica that provide regular 5.5 nm steps. We have used the STM/replica technique to examine the ripple shape and amplitude in the P-beta. phase of dimyristoylphosphatidyl-choline (DMPC) in water. STM images were analyzed using a cross-correlation averaging program to eliminate the effects of noise and the finite size and shapes of the metal grains that make up the replica. The correlation averaging allowed us to develop a composite ripple profile averaged over hundreds of individual ripples and different samples.

In general, special surface properties with regard to chemical composition, hydrophilicity, roughness, crystallinity, conductivity, lubricity, and cross-linking density are required for the success of these applications. Polymers very often do not possess the surface properties needed for these applications. However, they have excellent bulk physical and chemical properties, are inexpensive, and are easy to process. For these reasons, surface modification techniques which can transform these inexpensive materials into highly valuable finished products have become an important part of the plastics and many other industries. In recent years, many advances have been made in developing surface treatments to alter the chemical and physical properties of polymer surfaces without affecting bulk properties. Common surface modification techniques include treatments by flame, corona, plasmas, photons, electron beams, ion beams, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Plasma treatment is probably the most versatile surface treatment technique. Different types of gases such as argon, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, carbon dioxide, and water can produce the unique surface properties required by various applications. For example, oxygen-plasma treatment can increase the surface energy of polymers, whereas fluorine-plasma treatment can decrease the surface energy and improve the chemical inertness. Cross-linking at a polymer surface can be introduced by an inert-gas plasma. Modification by plasma treatment is usually confined to the top several hundred angstroms and does not affect the bulk properties. The main disadvantage of this technique is that it requires a vacuum system, which increases the cost of operation. Thin polymer films with unique chemical and physical properties are produced by plasma polymerization. This technology is still in its infancy, and the plasma chemical process is not fully understood. The films are prepared by vapor phase deposition and can be formed on practically any substrate with good adhesion between the film and the substrate. These films, which are usually highly cross-linked and pinhole-free, have very good barrier properties. Such films find great potential in biomaterial applications and in the microelectronics industry. Very high-power microwave-driven mercury lamps are available, and they are used in UV-hardening of photoresist patterns for image stabilization at high temperatures. Other applications of UV irradiation include surface photo-oxidation, increase of hydrophilicity, and photocuring of paintings. Pulsed UV-lasers are used in surface modification in many areas. Pulsed UV-laser irradiation can produce submicron periodic linear and dot patterns on polymer surfaces without photomask. These interference patterns can be used to increase surface roughness of inert polymers for improved adhesion. These images can also be transferred to silicon surfaces by reactive ion etching. Pulsed laser beams can be applied to inert polymer surfaces for increased hydrophilicity and wettability. Polymer surfaces treated by pulsed UV-laser irradiation can be positively or negatively charged to enhance chemical reactivity and processability. Pulsed UV-laser exposures with high fluence give rise to photoablation with a clean wall profile. There are many other practical applications of laser photoablation, including via-hole fabrication, and diamond-film deposition. The present review discusses all these current applications, especially in the biomedical and microelectronics areas.","HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM, KOWLOON, HONG KONG","Chan, CM (reprint author), HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM ENGN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG.",,,,,,,196,335,335,8,204,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-5729,,,SURF SCI REP,Surf.

The model was developed with special stress on its application to biological membranes. The electric potential distribution and the ion transport across the membrane are studied and the important role of the interface thickness L on ion transport and membrane selectivity is shown. An interesting result is found for certain combinations of charge and dipole densities: a cation selective membrane may become anion selective when L changes.

Quantitative or qualitative cell adhesion measurements would be useful for screening new implant materials. Microjet impingement has been evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, to determine to what extent it measures cell adhesion. The shear forces of the impingement, on the materials tested here, are seen to be greater than the cohesive strength of the cells in the impinged area, causing their rupture. The cell bodies are removed during impingement, leaving the sites of adhesion and other cellular material behind. Thus the method is shown not to provide quantification of cell adhesion forces for the metals and culture plastic tested. It is suggested that with highly adherent biomaterials, the distribution and patterns of these adhesion sites could be used for qualitative comparisons for screening of implant surfaces.","UNIV WALES,INST BIOL SCI,ABERYSTWYTH SY23 3DA,DYFED,WALES; TULANE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,NEW ORLEANS,LA 70118","Richards, RG (reprint author), AO ASIF RES INST,CLAVADELERSTR,CH-7270 DAVOS,SWITZERLAND.",,"Richards, Robert/I-8235-2015","Richards, Robert/0000-0002-7778-2480",,,,28,20,20,1,4,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 7DX",1065-6995,,,CELL BIOL INT,Cell Biol.

Numerous attempts have been made to create a novel surface that reduces the adverse effects of blood interaction with the material. The purpose of this study was to create reactive groups on Dacron without significantly altering the chemical and physical properties of the biomaterial. These groups would then serve as ''anchor sites'' for covalent attachment of the blood protein albumin to the surface, thus creating a more biocompatible surface. Denier reduction, an established textile chemistry procedure that creates carboxyl groups on the fiber surface via hydrolysis of the material, was performed at 100 degrees C using sodium hydroxide concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% (treated materials referred to as 0.5% hydrolyzed etc.). Tensile strength determination of hydrolyzed materials revealed no statistically significant difference in material strength between control, 0.5, and 1.0% hydrolyzed materials; the 2.5 and 5.0% hydrolyzed materials had significant strength loss as compared to the controls. Significant fiber weight loss occurred in the 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% hydrolyzed Dacron segments. The 0.5% hydrolyzed material did not have any significant weight loss. Covalent linkage of I-125-albumin to these modified materials using the crosslinker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) resulted in the 0.5% hydrolyzed material having the greatest protein binding (330 ng/mg Dacron, 2.4-fold greater than control). Incubation of the 0.5% hydrolyzed material with EDC and various concentrations of I-125-albumin resulted in the 14.80 mu M solution permitting the greatest binding per milligram Dacron (330 ng/mg Dacron). Scanning electron microscopy, performed blindly, revealed no change in the 0.5% hydrolyzed Dacron as compared to untreated Dacron. The 5.0% hydrolyzed Dacron, however, had noticeable structural damage on the outer periphery of the fiber surface. Observation of the untreated Dacron with nonspecifically bound albumin showed scattered areas of albumin adherent to the fiber surface whereas covalent linkage of albumin to the 0.5% hydrolyzed Dacron via EDC crosslinking showed numerous albumin moieties on each fiber. This study demonstrates that a clinically accepted biomaterial (Dacron) can be chemically modified, without significantly altering the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, in order to covalently bind albumin to the fiber surface. Thus, these results serve as foundation for creating potential novel biomaterials without significantly altering the properties of the original biomaterial.

Successful implementation of immunoisolation has been hampered by the foreign-body reaction to biomaterials. We screened a variety of commercially available membranes for foreign-body reactions following implantation under the skin of rats. Histologic analysis revealed that neovascularization at the membrane-tissue interface occurred in several membranes that had pore sizes large enough to allow complete penetration by host cells (0.8-8-mu m pore size). When the vascularization of the membrane-tissue interface of 5-mu m-pore-size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes was compared to 0.02-mu m-pore-size PTFE membranes, it was found that the larger pore membranes had 80-100-fold more vascular structures. The increased vascularization was observed even though the larger pore membrane was laminated to a smaller pore inner membrane to prevent cell entry into the prototype immunoisolation device. This significantly higher level of vascularization was maintained for 1 year in the subcutaneous site in rats.

Hemagglutination inhibition studies revealed that hemagglutination was not affected by heat, pH, cation concentration, proteolytic enzymes, biologic detergent, serum proteins, or subinhibitory antibiotics. Hemagglutination was abolished by periodate oxidation and digestion with glycosidases. It was markedly inhibited by beta-lactose and its monosaccharide constituents in a concentration-dependent fashion. Hemagglutinin expression depended on the presence of glucose. Chemical analysis of a partially purified hemagglutinin preparation and cell-free hemagglutinating supernatants revealed little or no protein and small quantities of reducing sugars, pentose, ketose, hexosamine, uronic acid, and phosphate.

Cytotoxicity and further related risks of amalgams are discussed in a controversial way in the literature without leading to a final conclusion. There is still a need for basic clinical and pre-clinical research, especially with respect to the wide distribution of dental amalgams. Standardized methods of cytotoxicity testing have been established by the ISO. It was the aim of the present study to detect and compare possible cytotoxic effects of dental amalgams and alternative non-amalgam alloys in vitro. According to the ISO standards, direct contact tests and extract dilution tests were performed using the cell lines HeLa and L-929 as well as primary isolated human fibroblasts, a relevant cell type of the human gingiva. For direct contact tests the samples were fixed on thermanox discs. Zn and Ni-chloride in defined molar concentrations were used as positive controls in the extract dilution tests, while copper was the positive control in the direct contact tests. The tested amalgam was a Non-Gamma-2 amalgam. For extract dilution tests sixteen extraction dilutions were performed. The different cell types were incubated with the extracts in 96-well microtitre plates. MTT-testing was performed to evaluate the effects on cellular metabolism. The BrdU labelling index was determined with the help of EIA methods to analyse the effects of the extracts on the cellular proliferation at DNA synthesis level. The morphological status of the cells seeded on the materials (direct contact test) were studied with the help of light microscopy. No cytotoxic effects of formerly extracted dental amalgam was found, although fresh amalgam elicited a significant cytotoxic effect, in general the non-amalgams have to be regarded as non cytotoxic. The negative control and the non-amalgams elicited no measurable cytotoxicity in the indirect contact assays, independent of the number of extraction dilutions. This applied to all cell types studied. The tested amalgam also gave a significant cytotoxic effect in the MTT-assays, while in addition a significant reduction of BrdU incorporation after incubation with the extracts of the first dilution series, compared to the silicone control was found. The effects were reduced after an incubation with the extracts of the higher dilution series. It is suggested by the presented results that amalgams might have cytotoxic effects, especially when being freshly applied. The cytotoxic effects were no longer detectable after extraction procedures. Nevertheless, a negative effect around such amalgams must be considered. The insights provided by the present studies might be helpful for a rational choice of dental materials.","QUALIDENT SA,CH-1217 MEYRIN 1,SWITZERLAND","Klein, CL (reprint author), UNIV MAINZ,INST PATHOL,LANGENBECKSTR 1,D-55101 MAINZ,GERMANY.",,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

We present another way of improving performance: the application of new technologies to well-known materials. The surface structure of a coating depends on the deposition technique. Hence, the transfer of, for example, sputtering technology to biotechnology may solve current problems with well-tried materials. This paper reports the influence of surface structure and area on the properties of pacemaker electrodes. Smooth electrodes were compared with porous electrodes produced by sintering and with fractal electrodes resulting from physical vapour deposition of iridium or titanium nitride. Micrographs revealed a slight enlargement of the surface area by sintering and an enormous enlargement with fractal coating. Analysis of electrochemical properties proved the advantages of fractal coating: the impedance spectra exhibited incomparable low impedances for frequencies down to 1 Hz and no afterpotentials could be detected. Clinical results confirmed the superiority of fractal electrodes.

We compared the effects of two physical crosslinking methods, ultraviolet irradiation (UV) (254 nm) and dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment, on the mechanical properties and molecular integrity of collagen fibers extruded from an acidic dispersion of type I bovine dermal collagen. Collagen fibers exposed to UV irradiation for 15 min had ultimate tensile strength (54 MPa) and modulus (184 MPa) values greater than or equivalent to values for fibers crosslinked with DHT treatment for 3 or 5 days. UV irradiation is a rapid and easily controlled means of increasing the mechanical strength of collagen fibers. Characterization of collagen extracted from the crosslinked samples by dilute acetic acid and limited pepsin digestion indicate that both UV and DHT treatments cause fragmentation of at least a portion of the collagen molecules. Partial loss of the native collagen structure may influence attachment, migration, and proliferation of cells on collagen fiber-based ligament analogs. These issues are currently being addressed in our laboratory.

It is particularly useful for measuring strains in materials where the use of conventional extensometers or strain gauges is impracticable, such as in reinforcement fibers and orthodontic wires and in hostile environments. The technique is based on the well known technique of observing translating laser speckle with a linear-array charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. However, it employs a relatively new data processing algorithm involving a two-dimensional frequency transform of the data. Advantages of the technique include: insensitivity to slow surface microstructure changes, insensitivity to zero-mean noise processes, compact design, modest resolution requirements, and the fact that it is truly noncontact. Strain rate measurements were made on an 0.028-gauge round stainless steel orthodontic wire as an example of this technique. The Young's modulus of the wire based on the speckle technique was 2.04 x 10(11) Nm(-2), which is very close to the textbook value.

Five weeks after the injection, we found clearly demarcated granulomas. Histological and immunohistochemical studies showed that these granulomas were similar among all strains, with either paucity or absence of lymphoid cells, In situ hybridization with use of complementary RNA probes indicated that macrophages were synthesizing interleukin-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA), a marker of macrophage activation, and a cytokine implicated in pathological bone resorption. We concluded that, in mice, there is a lymphocyte-independent pathway of macrophage activation in response to particulate polymethylmethacrylate, This suggests that the foreign-body response to particulate orthopaedic biomaterials is macrophage-initiated and maintained and that lymphocytes are not essential to this response, although they may modulate it. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The mammalian response to particulate biomaterials does not appear to fit a specific immune hypersensitivity response; rather, it seems to follow a non-specific pattern of macrophage phagocytosis, activation, and cellular response to monokine release, Differences in the response to debris among patients, manifested by differences in the rapidity and extent of osteolysis around joint prostheses, are more probably related to factors other than the hypersensitivity response, such as the amount of particles released, individual differences in macrophage activation, or intracellular damage created by the particles after phagocytosis.","TUFTS UNIV NEW ENGLAND MED CTR,BOSTON,MA 02111; MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP,BOSTON,MA 02114",,,,,,,,34,38,38,0,0,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

The interdisciplinary field combines, biomaterials cell biology, and cell culture bio-engineering technology. The main focus of tissue engineering is the synthesis of artificial constructs or tissues based on vital cells or cell matrix. Biomaterials provide a three-dimensional structure to shape or guide tissue development. Isolated cartilage cells from a patient can form new tissues when suspended in non-woven resorbable polymers for reconstructive surgery. To achieve sufficient amounts of autologous cells for transplant formation, cells from biopsies have to be multiplied in monolayer culture. Dedifferentiated and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells may be used for bone and cartilage engineering. High cell densities in three-dimensional cultures require perfusion techniques to stabilize culture conditions. Morphogenetic factors such as BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) are thought to play a key role in inducing and controlling phenotypic tissue formation. In conclusion, modern in vitro approaches open new avenues for the development of vital tissue replacements for the clinic. Tissues can be repaired with the patient's own cells eventually leaving no residual artificial materials. Tissue engineering further provides new approaches for in vitro models of the extracellular matrix or diseases which mainly affect this matrix such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

Recently, our laboratory extended the in vitro fibrillogenesis process to self-assemble macroscopic fibers from solutions of acid extracted type I collagen. These fibers may serve as scaffolding material for a variety of soft and hard tissue replacements. Results of mechanical analyses demonstrated that the self-assembled collagen fibers, 60-120 mu m in diameter, have dry tensile properties comparable with native, aligned fibrous tissue and wet tensile properties which are superior to similarly produced collagen fibers from insoluble type I collagen. Results of the birefringence analysis conducted in this study suggest that this technique is useful for correlating the degree of fibrillar alignment and packing with the mechanical properties of fibrous collagen scaffolds. Preliminary ultrastructural findings show that self-assembled collagen fibers contain aligned collagen fibrils with diameter distributions similar to native collagen fibers. Additionally, the uniaxial alignment of fibrils in collagen fibers self-assembled from soluble collagen was greater than similar fibrils observed in collagen fibers produced from disrupted, insoluble cerium.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH, DEPT PATHOL, DIV BIOMAT, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08854 USA",,,,"Pins, George/0000-0002-8844-8074",,,,28,41,41,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,,,MAT SCI ENG C-BIO S,Mater.

Movement of the impression and excessive seating pressure during this transition can cause distortion in the impressions. The purpose of this study is to determine if the impression distortion is related to movement during setting or to distortion of the putty phase in the two-step impressioning technique, A master model of a maxillary quadrant of teeth was impressed using four different procedures: 1) one-step technique without movement (1S-NM); 2) one-step technique with movement (1S-M); 3) two-step technique without movement (2S-NM); and 4) two-step technique with movement (2S-M). An artificial oral environment and surface analysis technique of the Minnesota Dental Research Center for Biomaterials and Biomechanics were used to produce the impressions and measure their accuracy. A digitized image of the first premolar of the master model was aligned with a digitized image of the first premolar of each epoxy model using AnSur. The root mean squared difference (RMS) between the aligned images is a measure of the distortion. The corresponding RMS values for the different methods were: 1S-NM = 23.7 +/- 9.21; 1S-M = 20.4 +/- 3.9; 2S-NM = 20.5 +/- 7.7; 2S-M = 21.3 +/- 4.4. Statistical analysis using a two-way analysis of variance showed no difference at the 0.05 level of significance. Pairwise comparison using the Tukey method showed that neither technique (one-step vs two-step) nor movement is a significant factor. These results showed that low seating pressure will not cause any greater distortions in the two-step impression technique than in the one-step technique, and minor movement during the setting of the impression material will not cause distortion.","UNIV MINNESOTA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL SCI,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455","LEE, IK (reprint author), UNIV MINNESOTA,SCH DENT,DEPT RESTORAT SCI,4-215 MOOS TOWER,515 DELAWARE ST SE,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455, USA.",,,,,,,9,18,19,0,0,UNIV WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,"SCHOOL DENTISTRY SM-57, SEATTLE, WA 98195",0361-7734,,,OPER DENT,Oper.

The antistaphylococcal activity of ofloxacin was quite elevated with a 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) of 1.56 mg/l against CNS and S. aureus. Rokitamycin and erythromycin showed a good activity against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, but were less active than ofloxacin and sagamycin against methicillin-resistant strains (MIC(90) > 100 mg/l). Sagamycin was highly effective against staphylococci (MIC(90) 0.78 mg/l) and appeared to be the most active compound against P. aeruginosa (MIC(90) 6.25 mg/l), followed by ofloxacin, tobramycin and gentamicin. In a successive part of the study, the adhesive properties of slime-producing staphylococci were tested on biomaterials used in ocular surgery. Intraocular lenses, Silastic sheetings, circling bands and grooved strips showed a high affinity for slime-producing strains, while round silicone sponges were not covered by bacterial biofilm. In the last part of our study, we demonstrated how subMIC levels of ofloxacin increased the adhesion of slime-producing staphylococci. Our data confirmed the excellent activity of ofloxacin and sagamycin against ocular pathogens and the key role of adhesion in promoting colonization and infections of biomaterials.","UNIV PAVIA,IRCCS S MATTEO,OCULIST CLIN,I-27100 PAVIA,ITALY","MARONE, P (reprint author), UNIV PAVIA,IRCCS S MATTEO,IST CLIN MALATTIE INFECT,SPERIMENTALI RIC,VIA TARAMELLI 5,I-27100 PAVIA,ITALY.",,"Marone, Piero/J-7973-2018","Marone, Piero/0000-0002-0342-2992",,,,12,5,6,0,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0030-3755,,,OPHTHALMOLOGICA,Ophthalmologica,NOV-DEC,1995.0,209,6,,,,,315,318,,10.1159/000310649,,,,4,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,TH749,WOS:A1995TH74900004,8751338.0,,,,2019-02-25

Several unit operations can be applied, e.g. filtration, centrifugation and ultrafiltration. On a production scale at DSM, filtration was used to separate the biocatalyst, but its performance was not satisfactory. Therefore, research was carried out in order to improve filtration and to develop an alternative separation process, in this case ultrafiltration. In filtration the use of a body feed of filter aid is required to avoid formation of a slimy layer of cells and cell debris on the filter cloth, which would cause a dramatic decrease in the filtration rate. A precoat of filter aid proved not to be necessary. The porous cake formed by gradual deposition of filter aid on the filter favours a high filtration rate and retention of biomaterials. The best results were obtained with a high grade of perlite, at a concentration of 10 to 15 kg/m(3), for a biocatalyst concentration of 4.3 kg/m(3). The observed average filtration rate for a batch time of 80 min and at a pressure of 2.5 bar was 580 kg/m(2) h. The filtrate was not entirely clear: the protein retention was 50%. This means that the proteins remaining in the filtrate must be removed in another process step, e.g. carbon adsorption. By means of ultrafiltration, a very clear permeate was obtained as all the cells, cell debris and enzymes were retained by the membrane (molecular weight cut-off 25 000 Da). The highest flux was observed at a high cross-flow velocity, 3.9 m/s. At low transmembrane pressure, 3.4 bar, the flux had approximately the same value as at 10.7 bar. From our experiments, it can be concluded that once a fouling or gel layer is formed, it is stable and it will not be removed by increasing the cross-flow velocity, lowering the pressure, etc. At a concentration factor of 10 and a batch time of 6 h the average flux observed was 25 kg/m(2) h. The protein retention was approximately 99%. The investment and operational costs are lower for ultrafiltration than for pressure filtration. However, due to a process alteration at a later date, neither an UF unit nor a filtration unit were required. The negative effects of the presence of enzymes and cell debris in the product solution were compensated by using carbon adsorption, which was already installed for the purification of the product.",,"MEINDERSMA, GW (reprint author), DSM RES BV,POB 18,6160 MD GELEEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,18,4,4,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Both anterior and posterior leaflets were less extensible in the circumferential than in the radial direction under equibiaxial stretch, with stress ratios of 5.7 and 4.3, respectively. The posterior leaflets exhibited greater extensibility in both directions and lower circumferential posttransitional moduli (ranges 690-820 vs. 2,500-3,200 N/m for anterior). This larger posterior extensibility may be due to the greater number of chordal attachments, which provide additional mechanical stability to this structure. Coupling of radial and circumferential mechanical behavior was evidenced by the response to different stretch protocols, indicating a complex microstructural coupling between individual collagen fibers or bundles. These are the first biaxial data for mitral valves and are a foundation far the development of a more detailed quantitative material description.","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, BALTIMORE, MD 21205 USA","MAYNEWMAN, K (reprint author), JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, SCH MED,DEPT MED,DIV CARDIOL,930 TRAYLOR BLDG, 1721 E MADISON ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21205 USA.",,,,,,,31,113,113,0,9,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0363-6135,1522-1539,,AM J PHYSIOL-HEART C,Am.

An autogenous bone graft is the optimal material of choice, however its use is problematic due to donor site morbidity, sparse amounts and uncontrolled resorption. Immunological responses and risk of viral contamination of allogenous and xenogenous bone materials make the use of these materials questionable. Healing and degradation of alloplastic materials are inconsistent with subsequent restricted use. The principle of guided tissue regeneration excluding soft tissue cells from a certain area is not alone sufficient to insure complete bony healing. Recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins have with success been added as adjuncts to already known biomaterials.

Many of the conventional therapeutic modalities have not adequately solved these problems. Medicated biodegradable devices used for drug delivery may offer several advantages over conventional ocular drug delivery methods. In this review, we discuss firstly the different mechanisms of erosion leading to the dissolution of the polymeric drug delivery systems. The principal investigation using polymer exhibiting a biodegradation (erosion type III) characterized by the cleavage of the polymeric chain, and the formation of small molecules is presented. These biodegradable polymers discussed include poly(alkyl cyanoacrylates), poly(lactic acids), poly(glycolic acids) and their copolymers, polycaprolactones, polyanhydrides and poly(ortho esters). In the last part of this review the application of these biodegradable polymers to the treatment of glaucoma is presented.","UNIV GENEVA,SCH PHARM,CH-1211 GENEVA 4,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,116,8,8,0,8,WISSENSCHAFTLICHE VERLAG GMBH,STUTTGART 10,"BIRKENWALDSTRASSE 44 POSTFACH 105339, W-7000 STUTTGART 10, GERMANY",0939-6411,,,EUR J PHARM BIOPHARM,Eur.

Dextran Mws of 500,000 and 40,000 were used for the preparations, CNBr:dextran-OH mole ratios ranged from 0.021:1 to 0.21:1. The microspheres absorbed significant quantities of water (20-45 times their own weight), and were shown to degrade in neutral buffer to soluble and non-toxic products. Hydration and degradation behavior varied linearly with the ratios of CNBr to dextran. The physical properties were dependent on the molecular weights of the dextrans used in the preparations. In contrast to epichlorohydrin crosslinked dextran microspheres that are resistant to hydrolysis and only degrade enzymatically, the described microspheres degrade more rapidly by simple hydrolysis of the iminocarbonate bonds that constitute the microspheres. Such degradative properties are ideal in the application of the microspheres as wound fillers and as components of wound dressings.","UNIV AKRON,DEPT CHEM,AKRON,OH 44325; VARISEAL MFG CORP,PARKMAN,OH; UNIV AKRON,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,AKRON,OH 44325",,,,,,,,34,5,5,1,6,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604",0883-9115,,,J BIOACT COMPAT POL,J.

In these novel polymers, non-toxic desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters are being used as monomers in place of industrial diphenols such as Bisphenol A. The high cost and limited availability of desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters have prevented the large-scale preparation of these polymers. To address this problem, the following four peptide coupling techniques were explored: dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (DCC/HOBt), ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino)propyl carbodiimide hydrochloride salt (EDCI . HCl), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) active ester, and p-nitrophenol (pNP) active ester. Desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine hexyl ester (DTH) was used as a model compound. DCC/HOBt led to a crude product that required column chromatography for purification. The water soluble coupling agent EDCI HCl made it possible to replace column chromatography by precipitation/extraction in aqueous media. This alleviated possible environmental concerns about the use of organic solvents. Furthermore, EDCI . HCl did not require the addition of an auxiliary nucleophile such as HOBt in the reaction mixture. The use of the NHS active ester of Dat also produced DTH of sufficient purity, but was less cost effective than EDCI . HCl. The pNP active ester produced DTH which could not be easily purified. Based on these results, the effectiveness of EDCI . HCl was verified by the 100 g synthesis of the ethyl, butyl, hexyl and octyl esters of desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine. All of these monomers could be polymerized to high polymers. Overall, the EDCI . HCl mediated coupling of Bat and tyrosine alkyl esters was identified as the best method for the large-scale synthesis of the desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters in a cost efficient and environmentally acceptable manner.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,21,19,19,0,9,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604",0883-9115,,,J BIOACT COMPAT POL,J.

A common urease-producing urinary pathogen, Proteus mirabilis, was maintained at a level of 10(6) colony-forming units/mL for 7 days in the dynamic perfusion reactors. The pH and bacterial population were monitored every 24 h and the percentage of encrustation on latex and hydrogel-coated commercial catheter materials gave reproducible results in three different runs, 15.2 +/- 3.65% and 13.8 +/- 2.58%, respectively. A major issue of inlet clogging due to ascending bacteria or ammonia has been rectified using a dismountable inlet assembly. An incubator coupled with a cooling system allowed accurate temperature maintenance of 37 degrees C in all four reactors.

In the present study, our goal was to extend these findings to an in vivo test environment on biomaterials. The subcutaneous cage-implant system was modified for mice to elucidate IL-4 participation in mediating FBGC formation in vivo. Exudate leukocyte concentrations from cages containing poly(etherurethane urea) (PEUU A') and empty cage controls indicated a similar inflammatory response that turned toward resolution by 14 days postimplantation, thus confirming the applicability of the cage-implant system in mice. FBGC kinetic analysis showed that the formation of mouse FBGCs occurs through the fusion of adherent macrophages at a constant rate up to 14 days of implantation. Purified goat anti-mouse IL-4 neutralizing antibody (IL4Ab) or normal goat nonspecific control IgG (gtIgG) at various concentrations, or recombinant murine IL-4 (muIL4) was injected into the implanted cages containing PEUU A' every 2 days for 7 days. The injection of IL4Ab significantly decreased the FBGC density on PEUU A' cage-implanted in mice, when compared with the nonspecific IgG or PBS injection controls. Conversely, the FBGC density was significantly increased by the injection of muIL4 when compared with nonspecific IgG and PBS injection controls. Adherent macrophage density, FBGC morphology, FBGC average size, and size distribution were not significantly different among IL4Ab, nonspecific control gtIgG, muIL4, and PBS control groups. Our data suggest that IL-4 participates in FBGC formation on biomaterials in vivo.

The derivatized PET samples were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to characterize their apparent surfaces, and by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) to quantify the amount of tags fixed on their open surfaces. Using this dual assay technique, we analyzed the surface of microporous membranes which are currently used as substrates for cell culture systems.","UNIV CATHOLIQUE LOUVAIN,CHIM ORGAN & SYNTH LAB,B-1348 LOUVAIN,BELGIUM; UNIV CATHOLIQUE LOUVAIN,BIOCHIM CELLULAIRE LAB,B-1348 LOUVAIN,BELGIUM; UNIV CATHOLIQUE LOUVAIN,CHIM INTERFACES LAB,B-1348 LOUVAIN,BELGIUM",,,,,,,,32,12,13,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-4332,,,APPL SURF SCI,Appl.

In this paper we determine the cytocompatibility of acyl azide- and GTA-treated pericardium in vitro, by an organotypic chick aorta culture technique developed for the evaluation of the propensity of vascular cells (both endothelial and smooth muscle cells) to migrate and grow on the surface of biomaterials. We first examined pericardium stabilization as a function of GTA concentration and time, so that we could minimize residual GTA molecules in the material. Treatment for 72 h with 0.05% GTA was optimal for thermal stabilization of the pericardium with a denaturation temperature (T-d) Of 86.8 degrees C, providing similar results to treatment with 0.6% GTA for 4 h (T-d = 85.1 degrees C). Pericardium treated in this way was, however, poorly cytocompatible with little vascular cell migration and growth when compared with tissues treated by the acyl azide methods. The best results were obtained with 0.5% DPPA; treated tissues showed a high level of cross-linking (T-d = 82.4 degrees C) and three-fold increases in cell growth and migration over those in a non-toxic control.","INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS,UPR 412,F-69367 LYON 07,FRANCE; COLETICA,F-69007 LYON,FRANCE; UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELLULAIRE EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 07,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE",,,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060",,,,29,45,46,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,SEP,1995.0,16,13,,,,,1003,1008,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)94908-4,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,RM797,WOS:A1995RM79700007,8580252.0,,,,2019-02-25

The estimation of platelet adhesion and activation was performed with two enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD42b (GP Ib) and CD 62 (GMP 140 or P-Selectin). The applicability of EIA was first demonstrated in microtitre plates coated with fibrinogen. The thrombogenic substrate showed that platelet adhesion and activation reached a plateau level within 30 min. The use of EIA for testing biomaterials was demonstrated with polymeric reference materials where a differentiation of materials with respect to adhesion and activation was achieved. To validate the EIA scanning electron microscopy was applied and confirmed the different extent of adhesion and activation of platelets on reference materials. In addition, polyurethaneureas, based on 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polytetramethylene glycols, with different hard segment content and composition were investigated. It was found that both adhesion and activation were not simply dependent on the hard segment content but also on the hard segment composition. To get more insight into the mechanism of this process, two EIAs for the binding of fibrinogen using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were developed. There it was shown that the adhesion and activation of platelets on polyurethaneureas was not simply dependent on the total amount of adsorbed fibrinogen but rather on its conformation, indicated by the binding of the monoclonal antibody directed vs the gamma-chain of fibrinogen.","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH DENT,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH MED,INST ROENTGENDIAGNOST INTERVENT RADIOL,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY; BIOCOMPATIBLES LTD,UXBRIDGE UB8 3PQ,MIDDX,ENGLAND",,,"Seifert, Barbara/K-7569-2012","Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,34,42,45,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,SEP,1995.0,16,13,,,,,1009,1015,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)94909-5,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,RM797,WOS:A1995RM79700008,8580253.0,,,,2019-02-25

For this purpose, porcine articular cartilage was incubated with phosphate buffer containing the corresponding amounts of NaN3 or merthiolate. Supernatants were assayed using NMR spectroscopy, and the content of soluble saccharides was determined using the dye Alcian blue. The results obtained clearly indicate that merthiolate is more effective than sodium azide. This makes the former a more suitable preserving agent for the storage of cartilage. A significant decrease in the lactate concentration, and enhancement of the acetate and the N-acetyl resonances indicate degenerative changes in the cartilage.

Solid phase processing techniques demonstrate organisation of already formed polymer chains. Orientation techniques and hot compaction of high modulus polymers show the potential for enhancing the properties of certain polymers, through controlled processing. Adding reinforcement forms part of the same strategy as solid phase deformation, namely adding value to (or compensating for) existing polymer properties, and novel thermoplastic composites, including biomaterials, are discussed in this context. Techniques involving manipulation of polarity in the polymer chain, for potential use of the materials in 'devices' are presented briefly.

The purpose of this study was to compare a methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) dye colorimeiric method with the standard Cr-51 assay as methods of assessing cytotoxicity of denial materials. Methods. Two MTT-based colorimetric formals, test tube and 96-well microplate methods, were compared to the Cr-51 release assay. A series of eight dental materials were evaluated. Cytotoxicity profiles were determined for each test material. A TC50 value (Toxic Concentration required to kill 50% of the cells) was determined for each biomaterial, and these results were used to make statistical comparisons between the methods. Results. The three methods were statistically correlated (p < 0.005) by comparison of the eight samples tested. That is, the same rank in toxicity was given by the two tetrazolium sample formats and the Cr-51 method. Significance. The MTT assay was found to have several advantages in comparison to the current standard Cr-51 release assay. Optimized in the 96 well format, complete dose response curves and greater sample comparisons can be made rapidly, making the MTT method more economical in time and cost. Furthermore, the MTT method is based on intracellular biochemical changes, measuring cell viability rather than cell morbidity, and has lower detectable limits than the Cr-51 release method. There is also less detector chemical binding interference than encountered in the Cr-51 release method.","UNIV MISSOURI, DIV PHARMACOL, TOXICORE LAB, KANSAS CITY, MO 64108 USA; UNIV MISSOURI, SCH DENT, KANSAS CITY, MO 64108 USA; MIDWEST RES INST, KANSAS CITY, KS USA",,,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE09696],,,15,28,28,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0109-5641,1879-0097,,DENT MATER,Dent.

All techniques immersed vascular grafts in rotating blood. In the gravimetric analysis, the weight of adherent thrombi was recorded at 2 min intervals for 20 min. In the torque analysis, a microviscometer continuously recorded the amount of torque developed as the graft rotated for 20 min. In the thrombin analysis, the blood sample was analyzed for fibrinopeptide A production indicating fibrinogen cleavage. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were treated by removal of air nuclei (denucleation), binding of heparin, or binding of polyethylene oxide (PEO). The gravimetric analysis determined that the time at which each group experienced clot initiation was as follows: control after 6 min, denucleation after 14 min, heparin after 18 min, and PEO after 10 min. Similarly, in the torque analysis all treatment groups significantly delayed the initial increase in torque from 8.0 min for control to 12.5 min for denucleation (P < .01), >20 min for heparin (P <.01), and 12 min for PEO (P <.05). The thrombin analysis determined that coagulation activity was reduced relative to control at 12 min with the denucleation group (P <.05) and heparin group (P <.01) and at 18 min with all treatment groups (P <.01). The similarity of results among the techniques increases confidence that each measurement accurately predicts in vitro thrombogenicity.

Quantitative measurement of specific aspects of this local host response to different but well-characterized biomaterial surfaces provides a crucial link in the understanding of the overall phenomenon of implant biocompatibility. A system has been devised for in vitro examination of responses of cells to controlled but independent changes in both the chemistry and morphology of polystyrene (PS) tissue culture surfaces. Micromachined silicon wafers wore used as templates to solvent-cast PS replicas [using 0, 1, or 2 wt % styrene (S) monomer additions] with either none, 0.5- or 5.0-mu m-deep surface grooves arranged in a radial array. When all possible morphologies were combined with all possible polymers, nine model biomaterial surfaces (MBSs) were produced. The chemical characteristics of the MBSs were determined using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, secondary ion mas's spectroscopy, and contact angle techniques and were found to be distinct. The types and amount of proteins that adsorb onto these surfaces from serum containing media were examined and found to consist of multiple molecular layers of relatively uniform composition. Self-contained tissue culture vessels formed from the MBSs were capable of supporting the growth of confluent cultures of rat calvarial cells. The model biomaterial system described here can be used to examine how simultaneous stimuli resulting from the chemical and morphological characteristics of a test material may influence biologic responses. Such multifactorial biocompatibility research is needed to properly document material-host interactions.

For all species, the mean size was less than 1 mu m. Human peripheral blood monocytes were challenged with these particles in a uniform manner on the basis of surface area. Phorbol 12-myristate acetate, zymosan, and nonphagocytosable titanium particles served as controls. Stimulation of human monocytes is a function of the composition and concentration of particles. In this study, TiAlV particles appeared to be the most competent to elicit the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators. Particles of commercially pure titanium and of fabricated ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene also could induce the release of various cellular mediators, albeit at a lower level, whereas the particles of polyethylene retrieved from interfacial membranes were less stimulatory in these short-term in vitro experiments.","RUSH PRESBYTERIAN ST LUKES MED CTR,RUSH MED UNIV,DEPT ORTHOPED SURG,CHICAGO,IL 60612; RUSH PRESBYTERIAN ST LUKES MED CTR,RUSH MED UNIV,DEPT BIOCHEM,CHICAGO,IL 60612; CLEMSON UNIV,COLL ENGN,DEPT BIOENGN,CLEMSON,SC",,,,"Jacobs, Joshua/0000-0003-3902-7334","NIAMS NIH HHS [AR39310, AR41634]",,,51,213,215,0,12,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

To evaluate the effect of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) surface on the binding of monoclonal antibodies against the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) by adherent endothelial cells, an in vitro bioassay was developed. STUDY DESIGN: Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown to confluency on fibronectin-pretreated ePTFE and on fibronectin-pretreated polystyrene culture flasks used as controls, Cells were assayed for size, density, viability, and binding of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. Human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were then cocultured with HUVEC adherent to ePTFE and control polystyrene and HUVEC were assayed for the binding of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. RESULTS. The adherence of HSVEC and HUVEC to ePTFE resulted in a twofold increase in the binding of monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 compared with control at 48 hours (p<0.005). The addition of PBLs to the adherent HUVEC resulted in a four- to eightfold increase in anti-ICAM-1 antibody binding on ePTFE and polystyrene, respectively, at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence of endothelial cells to ePTFE results in an increase in the binding of anti-IC;AM-l antibodies. Coculture of adherent HUVEC and PBLs results in a marked increase in the number of cells binding ICAM-1 antibodies. These data support the conclusion that ePTFE is associated with the activation of adherent cells, which is one aspect of a multicellular inflammatory response.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT SURG,DIV GEN SURG,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,0,AMER COLL SURGEONS,CHICAGO,"54 EAST ERIE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60611",1072-7515,,,J AM COLL SURGEONS,J.

What remains is acellular matrix with the structural proteins well conserved and normally arranged. Canine arteries extracted to acellular matrix were implanted as coronary artery bypass allografts in a canine model, without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and compared with autogenous saphenous veins. Of nine pilot acellular matrix implants, four were patent, as compared with four of seven saphenous vein grafts. All occlusions in both graft types occurred acutely soon after implantation, with almost all patent grafts followed up for 6 months. The acellular matrix allografts showed no inflammation and only minimal cellular repopulation. This model needs further development, but appears promising for preclinical evaluation. Canine aortic and pulmonic valves extracted to acellular matrix using a modification of our extraction process, eliminating the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate, were implanted heterotopically as allografts in the left main pulmonary artery in dogs, a location chosen to avoid the need for cardiopulmonary bypass. At 1 month, two-dimensional echocardiography of six implants showed leaflet motion and 3- to 5-mm Hg transvalvular gradients. Explant histology of four valves at 1 month showed no inflammation, cellular repopulation at the base of the valve, and partial endothelialization. Although much remains to be done, the acellular matrix process has the potential to produce a coronary artery bypass graft with performance similar to that of autogenous saphenous vein and a bioprosthetic heart valve with performance similar to cryopreserved homografts, both from an abundant supply of nonhuman tissues.","UNIV TORONTO,CTR BIOMAT,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT CELLULAR & MOLEC PATHOL,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT SURG,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT MET,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT MAT SCI,TORONTO,ON,CANADA; HOSP SICK CHILDREN,DEPT PATHOL,TORONTO,ON M5G 1X8,CANADA; HOSP SICK CHILDREN,DIV CARDIOVASC RES,TORONTO,ON M5G 1X8,CANADA","WILSON, GJ (reprint author), TORONTO HOSP,DIV CARDIOVASC SURG,ROOM CCRW 1-885,200 ELIZABETH ST,TORONTO,ON M5G 2C4,CANADA.",,,,,,,17,105,112,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0003-4975,,,ANN THORAC SURG,Ann.

Osteoid tissue, tightly adhered to the implant, appears within 2 we of the operation, while after 6 weeks newly formed bone surrounds and infiltrates the implant.

The approach is essentially based on a photochemical immobilization reaction. Two new conjugate molecules, compounds 2 and 3, were prepared. They consist of (i) dipyridamole, a well-known inhibitor of platelet activation, and a vasodilating drug with clinical application, for instance before and during pecutaneous transluminar coronary angioplasty (Dottering); and (ii) an aryl azide, a moiety that exhibits marked photoreactivity. In 2, the dipyridamole unit is directly linked to the aryl azide (via an ester bond), while a short spacer chain separates both units in 3. Upon irradiation of 2 or 3, adsorbed onto the polyurethane foil, the aryl azide is converted into a highly reactive species which reacts with a nucleophilic group on the polymer surface. In this way, the dipyridamole is covalently linked to the polymer. The underlying principle is also used in photoaffinity labeling, a well-known technique in biochemical studies on enzyme structure and function. From UN extinction experiments it could be deduced that the surface density of immobilized 2 is 4.9 nmol/cm(2). The surface density for 3 was 14.6 nmol/cm(2). The surfaces were subjected to an in vitro thrombin generation assay. This assay gives a valuable impression about the hemocompatibility of artificial surfaces. These experiments revealed that the clotting times were substantially prolonged as a result of the photoimmobilization of dipyridamole. This was especially the case for immobilized 3. This effect cannot be readily explained. Possibly, the enhanced activity of immobilized 3 is due to the spacer chain. An alternative explanation is that the surface density is larger for 3 than for 2. In addition, the photomodified surfaces were incubated with platelet-rich blood plasma (37 degrees C, 30 min) and subsequently examined by scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of the blood platelets adhered to the surface also showed that hemocompatibility increased in the order untreated polyurethane < polyurethane with immobilized 2 < polyurethane with immobilized 3. Future work will concentrate on evaluation of the role of the spacer (length, hydrophilicity, etc.), as well as on the possible use of this approach with respect to the construction of biomaterials with improved in vivo biocompatibility, in particular hemocompatibility.

Degradable nonporous, porous, and ''combi'' (porous with a nonporous layer on one side) poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) films and nondegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and (porous) expanded PTFE (e-PTFE) were used. Contact angles measurements indicate that PLLA is more hydrophillic than PTFE. Assessment of the inflammatory response was performed after various periods of implantation (up till 180 days), with both conventional light microscopy and immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The inflammatory response observed initially can largely be considered as part of the wound healing reaction, and up till day 40 the inflammatory response against PLLA was minimally more intense than against PTFE (porous as well as nonporous). From day 40 on, the PLLA films provoke more intense inflammatory response as compared to the PTFE films. Both porous PLLA and the porous side of the ''combi'' PLLA film provoke a more intense inflammatory response than nonporous PLLA and the nonporous side of the ''combi'' PLLA film, respectively. In general, PTFE and e-PTFE films provoke an inflammatory response which is minimally more intense than the one provoked by the sham operation. Almost no ingrowth of tissue was observed in the porous e-PTFE films. In contrast, there was abundant tissue ingrowth in and an inflammatory response against porous PLLA. It can be concluded that biodegradable PLLA films provoke a more intense inflammatory response than nondegradable PTFE films. Also, porosity enhances the inflammatory response. However, porosity enhances the inflammatory response only when the wettability of a biomaterial permits cellular ingrowth.

Derivatization of Co-Cr-Mo samples with organic and aqueous solutions of gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) resulted in a concentration-dependent number of reactive NH2 groups on the surface available for coupling to protein. The enzyme trypsin was used as a model biomolecule to investigate the effect of immobilization on proteolytic activity. Trypsin was coupled to the silanized samples by formation of Schiffs base linkages via glutaraldehyde. The nature of the interaction between trypsin and biomaterial was then probed by treatment with concentrated guanidine hydrochloride (GuHC1) and urea. Residual activity (following treatment with chaotropic agents) of trypsin immobilized on silanized Co-Cr-Mo was dependent both on the nature of the silane solution and on the type of chaotropic agent. Organic silanization with APS required a minimum density of approximately 49 NH2 per nm(2) of nominal surface area (> 0.021 M APS) for residual activity of immobilized trypsin. For aqueous silanization, approximately 5.4 NH2/nm(2) (0.51 M APS) resulted in maximal residual trypsin activity. Treatment with GuHCI removed more trypsin activity from Co-Cr-Mo samples silanized with organic solutions of APS than did treatment with urea. On the contrary, with aqueous silanization the samples possessed greater residual activity following treatment with GuHCI than following urea. Compared to simple adsorption with protein onto Co-Cr-Mo, both methods of silanization with APS resulted in superior residual immobilized enzyme activity.

At the end of the prescribed time periods, the cells were fixed and embedded in resin before removing the metal substrates using an electrolytic dissolution technique and a 7% NaCl solution. Transmission electron microscopic examination of stained, ultrathin sections of the biological samples revealed an intact interface with microscopic details characteristic to the cell line and similar to those reported in the literature for animal and explant studies. The osteoblasts exhibited continuous contact and intimate apposition to both the CoCrMo and stainless steel substrate surfaces and grew in multilayered structures; an electron dense layer (composed of mucopolysaccharides and proteins) was observed at the surface of both substrates; collagen fibrils and mineralized foci were observed in the extracellular matrix interspersed among the multilayered osteoblasts.

All available free amine groups had reacted with GA to form a Schiff base within 5 min after the start of the reaction under the conditions studied (0.5% (w/w) GA). Before crosslinks are formed the hydrolysable Schiff bases initially present were stabilized by further reaction with GA molecules. An increase in shrinkage temperature (T-s) from 56 degrees C for non-crosslinked DSC (N-DSC) to 78 degrees C for GA crosslinked DSC (G-DSC) was achieved after crosslinking for 1 h. From the relationship between the free amine group content and the T-s during crosslinking it was concluded that higher GA concentrations and longer reaction times will result in the introduction of pendant-GA-related molecules rather than crosslinks. After 24 h crosslinking an average uptake of 3 GA molecules per reacted amine group was found. No increase in the tensile strength of the materials was observed after crosslinking, which may be a result of formation of crosslinks within the fibres rather than in between fibres. Aligning of the fibres by applying a pre-strain to the samples and subsequent crosslinking yielded materials with an increased tensile strength.","UNIV TWENTE, DEPT CHEM TECHNOL, 7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,39,254,257,0,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Some surgeons advocate lengthening the fibrosed corporeal bodies by excising tunica albuginea and grafting such defects to straighten the penis. Tunica vaginalis, dermis, dorsal vein and lyophilized dura have been used for this purpose. Traditionally, these graft biomaterials have been sutured to the tunica albuginea. We assessed the feasibility, short-term safety and efficacy of diode laser tissue welding using albumin based solder and indocyanine green dye to perform patch graft corporoplasty in the dog. Ten animals were subjected to bilateral transverse excision of 1 x 2 cm. sections of tunica albuginea. Corporoplasty was performed using grafts composed of saphenous vein (5) or tunica vaginalis (5). Microsurgical repair with 7-zero polydioxanone suture (10) was compared to contralateral laser welded repair (10) by recording operative time, initial and short-term bursting pressures (mean plus or minus standard deviation) and histological analysis. Operative time on the laser side (9.8 +/- 2.3 minutes) was significantly shorter (p <0.05) than on the suture side (17.1 +/- 5.1 minutes). Leak pressures, initially (laser 105.7 +/- 23.8 mm. Hg versus suture 35.3 +/- 8.0 mm. Hg), at 3 to 5 days (greater than 333.3 +/- 62.4 mm. Hg versus 136.6 +/- 39.4 mm. Hg) and at 7 to 10 days (greater than 397.8 +/- 39.8 mm. Hg versus 191.5 +/- 46.4 mm. Hg) were higher (p <0.05) in the laser side compared to controls. Graft failure (necrosis) occurred in 3 repairs (2 laser on day 4 and 1 suture on day 10). Viable tissue with minimal differences in foreign body reaction between groups was observed in the remaining grafts. We conclude that laser welded patch graft corporoplasty using tunica vaginalis or vein is easy to perform, and provides excellent initial and short-term leak pressures. The use of laser welding in conjunction with suturing may be beneficial in corporoplasty for congenital or acquired penile curvature.","COLUMBIA UNIV COLL PHYS & SURG,CHILDRENS & BABIES HOSP,NEW YORK,NY 10032","KIRSCH, AJ (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV COLL PHYS & SURG,DEPT UROL,J BENTLEY SQUIER UROL CLIN,NEW YORK,NY 10032, USA.",,,,,,,24,6,6,0,2,WILLIAMS & WILKINS,BALTIMORE,"351 WEST CAMDEN ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21201-2436",0022-5347,,,J UROLOGY,J.

Contrary to protein crystal growth studies which indicate substantial increases in organization and size in microgravity, the gravitational environment had no repeatable effect on collagen and fibrin fiber diameters and matrix porosity. However, fibrin gels formed in microgravity appeared more homogeneous than ground samples. Changes in temperature and concentration of both protein and buffer had substantial effects on fiber diameters and material porosity for both collagen and fibrin. Temperature experiments were performed over the range 23.8 to 39 degrees C for fibrin and 22 to 33 degrees C for collagen. Thrombin concentration was varied from 0.02 to 0.10 units/ml for fibrin experiments and buffer concentration was varied by means of a dialysis membrane for collagen experiments. Consequently, the temperature and concentration controls developed far flight experiments are being considered for their potential in developing fibrin and collagen based materials with well-defined microscopic structures.

The histologic and biomechanic characteristics of posterior lumbar fusion with varying rigidity of a novel internal fixation construct in the rabbit were analyzed. Objectives. To evaluate this rabbit model for future studies of fusion augmentation. Summary of Background Data. Previous studies in goats and dogs showed internal fixation enhances spinal arthrodesis. Methods. Twenty eight New Zealand white rabbits underwent a posterior midline fusion from L4 to L6. Some animals received autogenous iliac crest bone graft, stabilized by wiring the superior facets bilaterally, and supplementation with polymethylmethacrylate. The experimental groups were iliac crest bone graft with either no fixation, wire fixation, or wire and polymethylmethacrylate fixation; and no graft and either no fixation, wire fixation, or wire and polymethylmethacrylate fixation. Animals were killed 2 months after surgery, and the specimens were nondestructively tested biomechanically for stiffness in six modes (flexion, extension, left and right bending, compression, and torsion) and histologically for evidence of fusion, revascularization, and new bone formation. Results. Fusions with either wire or wire and polymethylmethacrylate fixation were significantly stiffer than those without fixation (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the iliac crest bone graft and wire group and the iliac crest bone graft, wire, and polymethylmethacrylate group in the modes tested. Nine of 14 motion segments receiving the stiffest construct (iliac crest bone graft, wire, and polymethylmethacrylate) had evidence of solid bony fusion. None of the 12 motion segments receiving iliac crest bone graft and wire had evidence of bony fusion, but five had a fibrocartilage union with some ossification present. Eight of 12 motion segments receiving iliac crest bone graft and no fixation had predominantly fibrous unions with some fibrocartilage, and only one motion segment of 12 showed bony fusion.

As the basis for immobilization, regenerated cellulose films and hollow fibers were used. For the in vivo test, hTM immobilized cellulose hollow fibers were implanted into dog blood vessels. Using hTM immobilized cellulose hollow fibers, a small scale dialyzer was assembled and its antithrombogenic activity was studied using human blood. As a result, it was revealed that the immobilized hTM still has co-enzymatic activity for activation of Protein C and anticoagulant activity. The coagulation time of the human blood passed through the hTM immobilized small dialyzer was effectively prolonged.

In particular, the antibody-detectable (that is, conformationally intact) bound fibrinogen, but not the total amount of adsorbed fibrinogen, is correlated with platelet reactivity. In this work, the authors quantified the adsorbed plasma protein distribution inside the left ventricular assist device. They also evaluated the effect of wall shear stress on protein adsorption and conformational change of adsorbed fibrinogen. Conformational change of adsorbed fibrinogen was measured by exposing the fibrinogen preadsorbed polyurethane to three anti-fibrinogen monoclonal antibodies; the 134B-29 detectable alpha 566-580 domain of fibrinogen was increased with increasing concentration of adsorbed fibrinogen, whereas the other two fibrinogen domains were almost saturated when increasing the concentration of adsorbed fibrinogen. The adsorbed amount of total fibrinogen and monoclonal antibody detectable fibrinogen was decreased with increasing shear rate. Results of in vivo plasma protein adsorption on polyurethane surfaces disclosed that the adsorbed amount of fibrinogen, as well as albumin and globulin, was also decreased with increasing shear rate. In conclusion, less protein was adsorbed in the higher shear region and the effect of shear level on fibrinogen adsorption and its conformational change was strongly dependent upon the surface characteristics of the biomaterials, The monoclonal antibody 134B-29 against the 566-580 domain of fibrinogen was the most reactive with the fibrinogen adsorbed on polyurethane surfaces in this experiment.","SEOUL NATL UNIV HOSP,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,SEOUL 110744,SOUTH KOREA","SEOUL NATL UNIV HOSP,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,28 YUNGUN DONG,SEOUL 110744,SOUTH KOREA.",,,,,,,0,6,6,1,2,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-SEP,1995.0,41,3,,,,,M384,M388,,10.1097/00002480-199507000-00036,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,TC541,WOS:A1995TC54100037,8573830.0,,,,2019-02-25

Preliminary in vivo evaluation was studied by rabbit femur condyle implantation. There was no inflammation or any toxic sign during the experimental period. The histological section of intraosseous implantation revealed that the new bone deposited directly on the surface of the material in the fourth week after operation.

Extensive research has explored the potentiality of transplanting endothelial cells onto polymeric vascular grafts to improve graft function. Several critical issues have been explored including the source of endothelial cells for transplantation, the interaction of endothelium with polymers and the healing process of endothelial cell transplanted grafts.

This study was conducted to 1) measure the sensitivity of human and mouse macrophages to metal ions which are released from dental biomaterials, 2) compare these sensitivities with those of other cell types in the oral cavity, and 3) determine ii metal ions alter the metabolism and synthetic processes of these cells at lower concentrations than are required to lyse the cells. This information will help define the biological risks associated with the release of metal ions into the oral cavity. Methods. Macrophages were exposed to a range of concentrations of Ag1+, Au3+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, Pt4+, and Zn2+ for 24 h in cell culture. The concentrations which caused a 50% decrease in succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, protein production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured and compared with these values for fibroblasts and osteoblasts. Results. Most metal ions caused alteration in SDH activity and protein production at lower concentrations than were required to induce LDH release. There were exceptions to this trend, and the differences were not always statistically significant. Furthermore, although the macrophages sometimes had statistically different sensitivities to metal ions than fibroblasts or osteoblasts, these differences were less than one order of magnitude. Macrophage response to the metal ions was highly dependent on the metal ion and the species of macrophage. Significance. Macrophages react adversely to metal ions at similar concentrations as other cell types found in the oral cavity. Furthermore, the concentrations which affect cell metabolism and protein production are generally lower than those which lyse the cells. Thus, non-lethal concentrations of metal ions may alter the secretion of protein inflammatory mediators such as cytokines which direct the inflammatory responses in tissues.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL MED & SURG,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","WATAHA, JC (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL REHABIL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,33,58,58,0,6,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

The neutral red uptake by cells was used to count the number of cells still alive after contact with the diepoxy compounds, because this method was more sensitive in cell counting than the other four methods studied in this work. The amount of neutral red taken up by cells depended strongly on the activity of cells in comparison with other methods; only small amounts of neutral red were taken up when cells were in a low activity state even if they were still alive. The in vitro toxicity of diepoxy compounds evaluated by the neutral red method revealed a good correlation with that found by the in vivo Draize test. The in vitro cytotoxicity to a cell line of L929 was closely related to that of primary culture cells of the normal rabbit cornea epidermal cell. The toxicity of diepoxy compounds was lower as their chain was longer, probably because of the lower chemical reactivity. All the diepoxy compounds investigated in this study exhibited lower cytotoxicity than formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and a water-soluble carbodiimide.

Thus, during the last few years much attention has been paid to hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate as potential biomaterials for bone substitute. However, the disadvantage of all proposed calcium phosphate ceramics is their low mechanical strength. Therefore, the applicability of these materials is restricted to the non-stressed regions. The ultimate good of implantation of biomaterials in the skeleton is to reach full integration of non-living implant with living bone. The material could be used, much as a bone graft, as material itself resorbs or dissolves as bone growth occurs, and the end result is new remolded bone.

The membrane lateral resistance in air, resisting electrical voltage, the influence of impurities on resistance and the resistance change in acetic acid vapour are presented for the first time. It is shown that the electrical resistivity for self-assembling lipids depends on their duration of being in an electric field and the content of the conductive impurities. The interdigital electrode is a transducer as well as a powerful tool for researching biomaterials and mimicking materials. The conducting mechanism of lipids is discussed. This method is also suitable for some polymer membranes.","CHINESE ACAD SCI,INST SEMICOND,BEIJING 100083,PEOPLES R CHINA; BEIJING UNIV,DEPT CHEM,BEIJING 100871,PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,,14,5,6,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA LAUSANNE,LAUSANNE 1,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE 1, SWITZERLAND",0928-4931,,,MAT SCI ENG C-BIOMIM,Mater.

The interaction of salmon calcitonin (sCT) and poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) was detected during preparation and evaluation of microspheres. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the extent and nature of the interaction. Methods. Blank microspheres were prepared by an aqueous emulsification solvent extraction technique. Adsorption studies were carried out at six concentrations of sCT and three concentrations of microspheres. Adsorption isotherms were constructed using the Langmuir and Freundlich treatments. Results. Adsorption at 1 mg/ml sCT concentration resulted in almost complete depletion of the peptide from the adsorption medium with the time to reach maximum adsorption decreasing with increasing microsphere concentration. At sCT concentrations below 100 mu g/ml, a true equilibrium occurred in 1 hour or less while at higher concentrations (up to 350 mu g/ml), a transient equilibrium was reached in 1 to 2 hours, followed by further adsorption of the peptide. The adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm at concentrations below 200 mu g/ml, indicating formation of a monolayer. Multilayer interaction, described by the Freundlich isotherm, occurred at higher concentrations and resulted in complete depletion of sCT from the adsorption medium. The affinity constant during monolayer formation was 0.09 and the plateau surface concentration was 5.1 mu g/mg. The multilayer peptide-peptide adsorption showed a lower affinity (0.025) but higher capacity (24 mu g/mg) than the monolayer peptide-polymer adsorption. Conclusions. The results show that poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres have a high adsorption capacity for sCT which must be considered in formulating a controlled delivery product of this peptide.","UNIV KENTUCKY, COLL PHARM, LEXINGTON, KY 40536 USA; ORAVAX INC, DEPT DENT RES, FT GEORGE G MEADE, MD 20755 USA; TAIPEI MED COLL, SCH PHARM, TAIPEI, TAIWAN",,,,,,,,21,54,54,0,5,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,1573-904X,,PHARM RES-DORDR,Pharm.

Participants.-A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member consensus panel representing the fields of orthopedic surgery, rehabilitation and physical medicine, biomechanics and biomaterials, internal medicine, public health, geriatrics, biostatistics, and a public representative. In addition, 27 experts in orthopedic surgery, rehabilitation and physical medicine, biomechanics and biomaterials, rheumatology, geriatrics, and epidemiology presented data to the consensus panel and a conference audience of 425. Evidence.-The literature was searched through MEDLINE and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel and the conference audience. Experts prepared abstracts with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. Consensus.-The panel, answering predefined consensus questions, developed their conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. Consensus Statement.-The panel composed a draft statement that was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. Conclusions.-Total hip replacement is an option for nearly all patients with diseases of the hip that cause chronic discomfort and significant functional impairment. Most patients have an excellent prognosis for long-term improvement in symptoms and physical function. At this time, a cemented femoral component using modern cementing techniques, paired with a porous-coated acetabular component, can give excellent long-term results. Revision of a total hip replacement is indicated when mechanical failure occurs. Continued periodic follow-up is necessary to identify early evidence of impending failure so as to permit remedial action before a catastrophic event.","UNIV MARYLAND,SCH MED,DEPT EPIDEMIOL & PREVENT MED,BALTIMORE,MD 21201; UNIV KANSAS,MED CTR,CTR AGING,KANSAS CITY,KS 66103; HOWARD UNIV,WASHINGTON,DC 20059; BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,DEPT INTERNAL MED,WINSTON SALEM,NC; YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED & REHABIL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT BIOMAT,BIRMINGHAM,AL; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT SURG,DIV ORTHOPAED SURG,BIRMINGHAM,AL; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,SCH HYG & PUBL HLTH,BALTIMORE,MD; UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,MED CTR,DEPT MED,DEPT MED RHEUMATOL,PRINCETON,NJ; KOLCZUN & KOLCZUN ORTHOPAED ASSOCIATES,LORAIN,OH","MURRAY, DG (reprint author), SUNY HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT ORTHOPED SURG,SYRACUSE,NY 13210, USA.",,"Dickersin, Kay/A-4576-2008","Duncan, Pamela/0000-0002-4838-3253; Jacobs, Joshua/0000-0003-3902-7334; Cauley, Jane A/0000-0003-0752-4408",,,,0,79,79,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610",0098-7484,,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This dermal sheet can be covered with an epidermal cell layer which will allow to rebuild an in vitro human skin equivalent. This in vitro organogenesis technique was used since 1983 to treat burns and children suffering from severe cutaneous malformations (giant naevi). The results which were obtained after 33 grafts on 16 patients show that, if the epidermal graft is essential to preserve patients'lives the dermal constituent is also important in the long-term since it induces the synthesis, 3 to 6 months later, of numerous elastic fibers which give to the graft mechanical properties close to that of the normal skin as well as the recovery of a normal microrelief. These cutaneous reconstructions can be completed in one or, even better, two stages which enable the successive graft of reconstructed dermis and epidermal sheets, the latter obteined in great quantity thank's to Grenn's method.

Polyglycolic acid (PGA) and glycolide-trimethylene carbonate block copolymer fibers in the form of 2/0 size Dexon and Maxon sutures from Davis/Geck were used in this study. In addition, injection-molded PGA disks were also used for determining how different polymer morphology affected the outcomes of gamma irradiation and irradiation temperature. These two types of biomaterials were Co-60 gamma irradiated at two irradiation temperatures (55 and -78 degrees C in dry ice). Both gamma-irradiated and control specimens were immersed in a phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.44 at 37 degrees C for various durations of hydrolysis. After each predetermined duration, the specimens were removed for subsequent testing which included determinations of tensile strength, weight loss, level of crystallinity, melting temperature, intrinsic viscosity, surface morphology, and infrared spectroscopic characteristics. gamma irradiation at both irradiation temperature resulted in a faster hydrolytic degradation of these two biodegradable polymers. There was no apparent irradiation temperature effect in terms of mass loss, intrinsic viscosity, level of crystallinity, and melting temperature. However, irradiation temperature effect was evident in those properties that depended on the tie-chain segments located in the noncrystalline domains, such as tensile strength. The observed effect of irradiation temperature was attributed to chain mobility which could facilitate cage recombination of macromolecular radical pairs at the irradiation temperature lower than the glass transition temperature of the irradiated polymers.

Method: In Wistar rats the MNGC recruited after the implantation of hydroxyapatite (HA) particles in standardized skull defects were examined morphologically (at both the light and electron microscope levels), enzymatically (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase), and after a challenge with salmon calcitonin. Results: The MNGC were of great size and contained abundant mitochondria, vacuoles, and vesicles throughout the cytoplasm; they were either tightly apposed to the HA surface or had long and thin processes penetrating the material. When processed for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, only a few cells were weakly stained. The staining was totally suppressed when samples were pretreated with cyanuric chloride in the MNGC but not in the host osteoclasts. Calcitonin induced the withdrawal of the host osteoclasts from the bone surface while the MNGC remained in contact with the HA material. Conclusion: The MNGC recruited to HA particles did not exhibit the morphologic, enzymatic and functional characteristics of the osteoclasts, and consequently must be regarded as macrophage polykaryons.

Biomimetic approaches have been based on polymers endowed with bioadhesive receptor-binding peptides and mono- and oligosaccharides. These materials have been patterned in two- and three-dimensions to generate model multicellular tissue architectures, and this approach may be useful in future efforts to generate complex organizations of multiple cell types, Natural polymers have also played an important role in these efforts, and recombinant polymers that combine the beneficial aspects of natural polymers with many of the desirable features of synthetic polymers have been designed and produced. Biomaterials have been employed to conduct and accelerate otherwise naturally occurring phenomena, such as tissue regeneration in wound healing in the otherwise healthy subject; to induce cellular responses that might not be normally present, such as healing in a diseased subject or the generation of a new vascular bed to receive a subsequent cell transplant; and to block natural phenomena, such as the immune rejection of cell transplants from other species or the transmission of growth factor signals that stimulate scar formation.

Six-week in vitro exposure of 65:35 POE films to a cholesterol emulsion (1 g/L) showed no apparent difference in hydrolytic degradation rates of mechanical properties or mass loss compared to deionized water exposed films. Decreases of 28 and 6% in inherent viscosity were observed after 5 weeks for cholesterol and deionized water exposed films, respectively, suggesting cholesterol may have some effect, Further examination of the data, due to sample variation, revealed that clear, uniform films showed only minor changes in mass loss and mechanical properties after 6 weeks in either of the in vitro media, But slightly cloudy films possessing microscopic bubbles showed accelerated degradation in both media, indicating the effect of cholesterol was inconclusive due to sample variation, Central of the microbubble formation process could have utility in controlling hydrolytic degradation of POE films.

Recent studies have emphasized the endogenous source of these bacteria and have pointed to the upper gastrointestinal tract as a major source. Gastric bacterial overgrowth is known to be promoted by raised intragastric pH. Further evidence suggests that duodenal reflux is just as important in gastric bacterial overgrowth and subsequent colonization of the mechanically ventilated lung. Work on the biomaterials lining the inside of the tracheal tube in critically ill patients has shown that this biofilm can be scattered many centimetres as a result of ventilator gasflow. In vitro and in vivo evidence has been found to support a fluid dynamic process that results in dissemination of tracheal tube biofilm, which also contains neutrophils and their contents. The dissemination of combined bacteria, effete neutrophils and their breakdown products into already compromised lungs may explain the complexity of the clinical condition known as ventilator-associated pneumonia. It may thus be more correct to refer to the condition as 'ventilator-induced pnuemonitis'.",,"INGLIS, TJJ (reprint author), NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, FAC MED, DEPT MICROBIOL, LOWER KENT RIDGE RD, SINGAPORE 0511, SINGAPORE.",,,,,,,11,17,18,0,0,W B SAUNDERS CO LTD,LONDON,"32 JAMESTOWN RD, LONDON NW1 7BY, ENGLAND",0195-6701,1532-2939,,J HOSP INFECT,J.

The denaturation temperature, T-m, of rbSt and lysozyme decreased with increasing moisture irrespective of the excipient. However, the magnitude of the decrease elicited by moisture was dependent on the type of excipient. Furthermore, the effect of the excipient was dependent on the moisture content; excipients decreased T-m in low moisture solids (i.e., < 5% moisture) and increased it in hydrated solids (i.e., > 15% moisture). In the dry state < 1% moisture), the addition of 50% sucrose, sorbitol, or glycerol lowered the T-m of rbSt from 161 degrees C to 136, 120, and 83 degrees C, respectively, indicating a destabilizing mechanism. Likewise, the T-m of lysozyme decreased from 156 degrees C to 142, 128, and 97 degrees C due to the addition of sucrose, sorbitol, and glycerol, respectively. At higher moisture contents, the excipients promoted a higher transition temperature at a given moisture content than the pure protein systems, indicating a stabilizing mechanism. An increase in the enthalpy of unfolding for dehydrated lysozyme was noted with increasing levels of moisture and/or excipient, despite the observed decrease in T-m. The thermal stability, or T-m, of the dehydrated proteins appeared to be correlated to the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the excipient, which in turn should be related to the T-g of the system. The lower the T-g of the excipient, the greater was the degree of destabilization. This result suggests different modes of conformational stabilization by excipients may exist for proteins in the solid state depending on the moisture content.","UPJOHN CO,DRUG DELIVERY RES & DEV,KALAMAZOO,MI 49007",,,,,,,,43,82,84,0,14,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on polytetrafluoroethylene also deposited more plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 into the extracellular matrix than did control cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene, Our results give evidence that human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on two biomaterials used to construct vascular grafts, namely polytetrafluoroethylene and polyurethane, produce tissue-type plasminogen activator as well as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, two major components of the fibrinolytic system also expressed by endothelial cells in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that endothelial cells grown on vascular grafts show functional integrity concerning their fibrinolytic system, which in turn might contribute to reduce the thrombogenic properties of the graft material.","UNIV VIENNA,DEPT MED PHYSIOL,CLIN EXPTL PHYSIOL LAB,A-1090 VIENNA,AUSTRIA; NATL INST CONTROL PHARMACEUT & BIOL PROD,BEIJING,PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,,30,19,19,0,1,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-5223,,,J THORAC CARDIOV SUR,J.

Only treatments with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride were found to disrupt rhapidosomes. A protocol was developed to renature the disrupted component proteins using rapid dilution and subsequent dialysis of the residual guanidinium hydrochloride. The renatured proteins were shown to have secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism. Furthermore, upon renaturation the two component proteins interacted with each other to form a complex of molecular mass > 2500 kDa.

The enabling concept is straightforward: cells or small clusters of tissue are surrounded by a selective membrane barrier which admits oxygen and required metabolites, releases bioactive cell secretions but restricts the transport of the larger cytotoxic agents of the body's immune defense system. Use of a selective membrane both eliminates the need for chronic immunosuppression in the host and allows cells to be obtained from non-human sources, thus avoiding the cell-sourcing constraints which have limited the clinical application of general successful investigative trials of unencapsulated cell transplantation for chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, and type I diabetes. Target applications for encapsulated cell therapy include these same disorders as well as other disabilities caused by loss of secretory cell function which cannot be adequately treated by current organ transplantation or drug therapies and conditions potentially capable of responding to local sustained delivery of growth factors and other biologic response modifiers. Several types of device configurations are possible. Here we focus on easily retrieved, non-vascularized, macrocapsules. Such devices have four basic components: a hollow fiber or flat sheet membrane (usually thermoplastic based), cells (primary or dividing), and extracellular matrix (natural or synthetic) to promote cell viability and function, and other device components such as seals, tethers and radio-opaque markers. Choice of membrane and extracellular matrix polymers as well as issues surrounding implantation and biocompatibility evaluation are complex, inter-related, and ultimately driven by implantation site and delivery requirements.

This regulation is generally mediated by cell receptor/ligand interactions providing primary targets for molecular intervention. While regulatory ligands may often be exogenous in nature, in the categories of endocrine and paracrine hormone systems, they are being increasingly appreciated as crucial in local control of cell and tissue function. Improvements in design of health care technologies involving autocrine ligand interactions with cell receptors should benefit from increased qualitative and quantitative understanding of the kinetic and transport processes governing these interactions. In this symposium paper we offer a concise overview of our recent efforts combining molecular cell biology and engineering approaches to increase the understanding of how molecular and cellular parameters may be manipulated for improved control of cell and tissue function regulated by autocrine ligands.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CELL & STRUCT BIOL,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV UTAH,DEPT PATHOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT",,,,"Wiley, Steven/0000-0003-0232-6867",,,,57,12,12,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL INC CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0090-6964,,,ANN BIOMED ENG,Ann.

To achieve such a goal, two approaches have been successfully applied: existing cellulosic polymers were modified, either by introducing functional groups through ester or ether bonds, by mixing synthetic polymers with bulk additives, or by using copolymerization techniques. As a detailed example, the first synthetically modified cellulose membrane, Hemophan, was prepared by substituting some hydrogen atoms in the cellulosic glucose unit by diethyl-amino-ethyl groups with the modification having a considerable impact on the membrane's hemocompatibility. It is further known that the hemocompatibility of hydrophobic synthetic membranes is improved by rendering these materials partially hydrophilic. We tested the hypothesis, whether the hemocompatibility of a material, which is hydrophilic per se, such as unmodified cellulose, is changed after the introduction of hydrophobic substituents. For this purpose, the number and nature of substituents have been systematically varied in order to alter surface properties, and these variations have been subsequently related to blood compatibility parameters. As expected, thrombin generation as well as complement- and cell-activation depend on the number and nature of the substituents whereby some of the substituents show a very narrow optimum if their hemocompatibility is related to the degree of substitution. Changes in hemocompatibility can be followed by physical methods, such as surface angle analyses and zeta potential determinations. Data show that alterations in the lipophilic/hydrophilic balance on the polymer surface may explain substituent-related changes in polymer hemocompatibility. Molecular modeling of membrane surface and protein structures may be of further help in understanding possible interactions. The recent conclusion is that polymer modification and techniques in membrane surface characterization help us to optimize membrane fabrication for specific applications.","GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,GEESTHACHT,GERMANY","VIENKEN, J (reprint author), AKZO NOBEL FASER AG,POSTFACH 200151,D-42289 WUPPERTAL,GERMANY.",,,,,,,38,46,46,1,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL INC CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc., to withdraw its polymers for use in implantable devices has presented the medical device industry with an immediate and serious challenge to find alternative sources of biomaterials. In France, the company Cardial S.A. has already taken steps to find an alternative polyester yarn to replace Dacron(R) by developing a new arterial prosthesis knitted from polyester yarns supplied by Rhone-Poulenc Fibres. This article describes an in vitro and in vivo study of this French device, called the Dialine(R) prosthesis, with a view to determining its relative performance compared to current American and British prostheses, which rely on DuPont's Dacron(R) yarn. In addition to analyses of the morphology and textile structure, and measurements of its physical and chemical properties, the Dialine(R) graft was implanted as a thoracoabdominal bypass in dogs for periods ranging from 4 h to 6 months. In addition to our pathologic and histologic observations, we cleaned and evaluated the explanted prostheses for in vivo changes in dimensions, strength, and crystalline microstructure. The Dialine(R) graft was found to differ structurally from other polyester prostheses because it is warp-knitted from a mixture of flat and texturized yarns with finer filaments. Its denser structure has a lower water permeability, greater flexibility and ease of handling, satisfactory strength, and dimensional stability, and it presents different textures on its luminal and external surfaces. The in vivo trial demonstrated that it has excellent biocompatibility and biostability over 6 months. With no thrombi observed on the luminal surface after 3 months, it has a faster rate of healing, generates compact external and internal capsules with a thinner neointima, and has an overall milder inflammatory response than is normally observed with Dacron(R)-based prostheses.

This morbidity of Cpa is primarily do to activation of blood proteins and cells by contact with nonendothelial cell surfaces of the wound and biomaterials of the extracorporeal perfusion circuit. CPB is not possible without heparin, yet heparin is not an ideal anticoagulant and does not prevent activation of at least five plasma protein systems and five blood cells. Stimulation of these blood elements produces over 25 vasoactive substances that alter vascular tone, capillary permeability, and cardiac myocyte contractility. In addition, CPB produces showers of microemboli that pass filters to obstruct arterioles and precapillaries to produce necrosis of widely dispersed, small groups of cells. Attempts to develop nonthrombogenic synthetic materials have failed; only the endothelial cell is nonthrombogenic and achieves this property by active metabolic processes. Although some biomaterials are less thrombogenic than others, all activate blood elements to initiate clotting and the body's defense reaction. The concept of ''blood anesthesia'' envisions the use of reversible inhibitors of key blood reactions to temporarily prevent activation of blood elements during Cpa. If the initial reactions of blood with nonendothelial surfaces are blocked, production of many vasoactive substances and microemboli by CPB is suppressed. This conserves blood elements that are normally consumed during CPB and makes them available after the inhibitor is reversed. Effective, reversible inhibitors of platelets are entering clinical trials; reversible inhibitors of other key blood relations ave being developed and tested at a rapid rate. Within the next decade ''blood anesthesia'' for Cpa promises to substantially reduce the morbidity associated with open heat surgery.","UNIV PENN,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 47186],,,0,8,8,0,0,FUTURA PUBL CO,ARMONK,"135 BEDFORD RD, PO BOX 418, ARMONK, NY 10504-0418",0886-0440,,,J CARDIAC SURG,J.

In this study we aimed to investigate incidence of calcification of (crosslinked) dermal sheep collagens (DSCs) with respect to their specific properties, during subcutaneous implantation in rats. Three types of DSCs were commercially obtained: non-crosslinked DSC (NDSC), and DSC crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GDSC) and hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDSC). NDSC, HDSC and GDSC were (enzymatically) tissue culture pretreated to eliminate their cytotoxic products. Beside this, crosslinking methods were modified to optimize mechanical properties and to decrease cytotoxicity, which resulted in HDSC* and GDSC*. Furthermore, DSC was crosslinked by activation of the carboxylic groups, i.e. by means of acyl azide and carbodiimide, resulting in AaDSC and CDSC, respectively. After implantation of HDSCs and GDSCs a relation between cytotoxicity and calcification of crosslinked DSC could be made. No relation was found between cellular infiltration of DSCs and calcification. However, from the use of different types and modification of crosslinking methods it might be concluded that calcification is mainly related to stable crosslinks, i.e. to the chemical properties of the obtained material.","UNIV TWENTE, DEPT CHEM TECHNOL, 7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT CELL BIOL & ELECTRONMICROSCOPY, OOSTERSINGEL 69-2, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.",,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,40,38,38,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Methods: Foreign-body infection in the biliary tract was investigated in rats. Rubber drain pieces were implanted in the biliary tract in rats for 1-4 weeks, followed by challenges with 10(2) to 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu) Escherichia coli injected into the common bile duct. The rate of infection was calculated, the bacterial growth in the biliary tract was observed over 72 h after challenges, and the opsonic activity in bile and in sera was assessed. Results: In the group with drain material, inocula as small as 10(2) cfu produced persisting infection in the common bile duct in 90% of animals, whereas the same number of E. coli infected only 30% of rats in the control and sham implantation groups (p < 0.01, chi-square test). Complement-mediated opsonic activity in bile of animals with implanted drain pieces gradually decreased with time, whereas opsonic activity in sera from the same animals remained unchanged. Conclusions: Implants in the biliary tract impair local host defense, resulting in an increased susceptibility to microbial infection.","UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT SURG,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN; UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,"Bengmark, Stig/0000-0003-1809-8889",,,,36,5,5,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0036-5521,,,SCAND J GASTROENTERO,Scand.

However, surprisingly little is known of the factors that determine biocompatibility of the materials used in these devices. These materials, although generally inert and non-toxic, can mediate a variety of adverse reactions, including inflammation, fibrosis, coagulation, and infection. This brief review focuses on the inflammatory responses (including fibrosis) that commonly occur around implanted biomaterials. Host proteins that spontaneously associate with implant surfaces are important determinants of the acute inflammatory response. In this regard, adsorbed fibrinogen appears particularly pro-inflammatory. Chronic inflammatory processes, in many cases in response to fragments of implanted biomaterials, may cause implant failure. In the case of silicone-filled mammary prostheses, the extravasation of silicone gel has been held responsible for a number of complications, including silicone granuloma, synovitis, connective-tissue disease, and lymphadenopathy. In some instances, material-mediated inflammatory responses may even cause degradation of the material itself (via oxidative products released by implant-associated inflammatory cells). Overall, there is insufficient knowledge of the determinants and mechanisms of host: implant responses. A clear understanding of tissue:biomaterial interactions will be required both to explain the pathogenesis of many implant-mediated complications and to aid in the development of more biocompatible materials for implantable devices.","ALBANY MED COLL,DEPT PATHOL & LAB MED,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,ALBANY,NY 12208",,,,,,,,100,300,306,4,87,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0002-9173,,,AM J CLIN PATHOL,Am.

Pathologic findings in different organs show that it can accumulate in brain, muscle, liver and bone. Therefore, we investigated whether patients with cementless total hip endoprostheses made out of titanium alloys containing aluminum are at risk. In order to determine the complete aluminum body loading in patients who have had their hip replacement for a long period of time (mean 58 months), we mobilized possible stores of aluminum with desferoxamine (DFO). Electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to quantify the level of aluminum in serum and urine before and after DFO treatment. A serum aluminum value of 10 mu g/l or less is internationally accepted as safe. The average serum aluminum level in this study was 14.2 mu g/l, which is slightly above the limit, but clearly below those levels which can lead to disease (> 50 mu g/l). No relevant storage of aluminum was found. This latter finding is more important since chronically elevated aluminum levels lead to cellular deposits, which affect the cellular biochemistry. The values before and after DFO mobilization did not differ substantially, indicating that aluminum in alloys for biomaterials can be regarded as safe as far as the risk of aluminum release in vivo is concerned. Histologic studies of bone from the bone-metal interface also showed no deposits of local aluminum release.","DIALYSEZENTRUM,BOVENDEN,GERMANY; UNIV GOTTINGEN,ORTHOPAD KLIN,GOTTINGEN,GERMANY","DITTERT, DD (reprint author), UNIV KLIN GOTTINGEN,PATHOL ABT 1,ROBERT KOCH STR 40,D-37075 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,17,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0936-8051,,,ARCH ORTHOP TRAUM SU,Arch.

Four types of copolymer polystyrene (PS) microspheres were synthesized by variation of four possible monomer ratios that included styrene, methoxy-PEO-methacrylate (750 and 2000 mol. wt PEO) and allylurea. This produced poly(styrene-(methoxy-PEO)methacrylate) microspheres with hydrophilic side-groups of either urea (PS-U-PEO) and/or mixed molecular weight (750/2000 mol. wt) PEO (PS-U-M-PEO, PS-M-PEO), or single molecular weight (2000) PEO (PS-PEO) at their surfaces. The hypothesis was tested that increasing the total content of PEO comprising the steric barrier reduces attachment to cell surfaces. Attachment of PEO microspheres bearing the urea spacer and/or mixed molecular weight PEO was found to be intermediate between charge stabilized control PS and PEO (2000 mol. wt) bearing particles. Post-adsorption of different Poloxamer (PEO-poly(propylene oxide)-PEO) surfactants to the microspheres further decreased attachment. Significant negative linear correlations between surface PEO content, measured by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), and attachment to Kupffer cells were demonstrated. Decreases in attachment also resulted with all graft PEO particles bearing adsorbed sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), whilst the attachment of SDS-treated PS control particles increased. It is proposed that trains of adsorbed graft PEO are displaced by the SDS to increase the effective fraction of graft PEO within the steric layer. Overall, increasing the amount of hydrophilic PEO in the steric layer, from graft and adsorbed sources, reduces the attachment of these particles to Kupffer cells in vitro.","UNIV NOTTINGHAM,DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI,NOTTINGHAM NG2 7RD,ENGLAND; ICI AGROCHEM,BRACKNELL RG12 GEY,BERKS,ENGLAND; ICI PHARMACEUT PLC,MACCLESFIELD SK10 4TG,CHESHIRE,ENGLAND; ICI PAINTS,SLOUGH SL2 5DS,BERKS,ENGLAND; UNIV SURREY,DEPT MAT SCI,GUILDFORD GU2 5KH,SURREY,ENGLAND",,,,"Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596; Harper, Garry/0000-0001-9646-0850",,,,39,24,24,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,APR,1995.0,16,6,,,,,427,439,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)98815-V,,,,13,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QT559,WOS:A1995QT55900001,7654869.0,,,,2019-02-25

We propose that biocompatibility of contemporary medical implants is not a property of the chemical composition of the biomaterials but depends rather on their physical attributes. The histological reaction patterns of tissue to the presence of polyethylene in diverse physical states are described. The inflammatory response evoked by the implants is laudable in so far as it precedes and accompanies the adequate tissular incorporation of the devices used. On the other hand, the granulomatous reaction induced by small, irregularly shaped and edgy breakdown products adversely affects the life span of the implants. Thus the manner in which the host handles the biomaterials is determined primarily by the physical state of the biomaterials (rather than their chemical composition), which in turn determines the success or failure of reconstructive surgery. It logically follows that biocompatibility constitutes a relativistic concept.","BNAI ZION MED CTR,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,IL-31048 HAIFA,ISRAEL; TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,RAPPAPORT FAC MED,CTR IMPLANT SURG,HAIFA,ISRAEL","BOSS, JH (reprint author), BNAI ZION MED CTR,DEPT PATHOL,POB 4940,IL-31048 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,39,10,11,1,3,ISRAEL JOURNAL MED SCIENCES,JERUSALEM,"2 ETZEL ST, FRENCH HILL, JERUSALEM 97853, ISRAEL",0021-2180,,,ISRAEL J MED SCI,Isr.

All of the polymers except Dacron demonstrated reduced bacterial adhesion with increasing shear stress. Argon plasma treatment of polyethylene reduced the level of staphylococcal adhesion. Adsorption of human plasma proteins effected significantly lower numbers of adherent bacteria. The lowest adhesion was observed for Ar-PE in 1% human plasma protein solution, whereas Dacron had the highest number of adherent bacteria. The high adhesion on Dacron was attributed to increased bacterial flux caused by topography-induced turbulent flow and physical entrapment of the bacteria in the fiber interstices.

At retrieval the plates were covered by a connective tissue layer of 2 mm thickness on average. In patients with local pain a comparatively significant higher number of round cells (p=0.001) and macrophages (p=0.01) was found. This is consistent with a chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction.

The main structural features of the films are the aliphatic amine bilayers and lamellarly ordered nucleic acid strands between them. The interlayer distances of the complexes of the aliphatic amine with the nucleic acids were found to be by 7-8 Angstrom greater than those of the aliphatic amines without nucleic acids. IR spectra of the LB films at various relative humidities reveal that the multilayer complex formation is provided by the interaction between PO2- and C=O groups of nucleic acids and NH3+ -groups of aliphatic amines. This means that the native DNA unfolds during the LB films fabrication.

How can we predict the long term security and efficacy of such an implant ? Only an interdisciplinary approach can provide a satisfactory answer. The surgeon must define the needs, he must find the appropriate surgical techniques and conduct the clinical trial. The material scientist must elaborate safe and secure materials with regards to their biotolerance and mechanical resistance. This has to be performed in close connection with the biomechanics lab. Biomechanic Science must predict the expected stresses. It has to design special simulator to quantify in vitro material toughness, wear characteristics, lubrication, behaviour and surface deformation. Biological and mechanical standardized tests have to be carried on. Then it is possible to conduct a clinical trial, prospectively in comparison to another already developed material. Clinical studies could serve to measure efficacy and radiological modification. After failure, it is possible to analyse retrieved specimen, to measure the material degradation in real environment, to perform biological studies on retrieved tissues ie : macrophagic activities, tissue response, bone ingrowth, inflammatory or immulogical reaction. For more than twenty years we worked on alumina against alumina total hips. The idea was to develop a low debris system to enhance long term longevity of the prosthesis. The Charnley design has proven its effectiveness for more than fifteen years, but polyethylene wear is responsible for late failures. This is specially crucial for young patients, male sex and high activity level patients. At the beginning, biological studies and mechanical tests were performed, it appeared that the biological tolerance of alumina ceramic was excellent, the fracture thoughness was adequate, but there were some problems related to alumina fixation in the body and also alumina head fixation on metallic stem. Alumina material improved with time. It was possible to diminish the fracture risks and to increase the safety. Parallel information from the first period was used to increase the material quality, the surgical techniques and also to define indication in the use of such material. It is now clear and it also has been published that alumina against alumina system has proved to be as safe as Charnley total hips. It has been proved to give better results in the young age population. Then it is now possible to operate on very young patients, to allow these patients to perform heavy work, sports and regular daily activity for their demand. In conclusion, long terme evaluation of orthopaedic implants has to be carried on with very scientific bases. Prospective tests must mimic a in-living system, but the clinical trial is the only way to really get the answer for the very long term.",,"SEDEL, L (reprint author), HOP ST LOUIS,SERV CHIRURG ORTHOPED & TRAUMATOL,1 AVE CLAUDE VELLEFAUX,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,5,ACADEMIE NATL DE MEDECINE,PARIS 06,"16 RUE BONAPARTE, 75272 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0001-4079,,,B ACAD NAT MED PARIS,Bull.

It took 10 years for intraocular lenses to take off, due to the necessary improvement of both surgery and manufacturing, since then all the intraocular lenses are made of the same material and perfectly tolerated. However the material is hard and not foldable. The improvement of Phakoemulsification have made small incision (3,2 mm) surgery possible, however there is a need for new foldable implants that can be inserted into the eye through a small incision, so rather new bio material are now being used. A variety of silicone foldable lenses have been proposed, their advantages are : easy foldability, solidity and injectability through an injector. Their disadvantages are, as compared to the 40 years standing solid PMMA lenses; less biocompatibility changes in color and apparition of crystal precipitates. Also reports on induced polyarthritis, lupus and paraneoplasic syndroms with other silicone prosthesis, these complications appear after 5 or 6 years. Although new silicone lenses are being brought on the market, there is some hesitation in implanting these lenses on patients less than 80 years of age. Polyhema lenses appeared in 1985, with 38 % water content. The material is perfectly biocompatible even more than PMMA, however their initial design mi was not adequate until 1992. Their advantages are perfect biocompatibility over the years, autoclavability. Their only disadvantage a certain fragility during folding. Our 7 years experience with silicone and hydrogel has shown that 20 % of the first silicone lenses had to be exchanged between 3 to 4 years after surgery and 0 % of the polyhema. Posterior capsule opacification at 1 year was twice more frequent with silicone thant with PMMA or hydrogels and that mild chronic uveitis occurs 3 times frequently with silicone lenses.",,,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,8,ACADEMIE NATL DE MEDECINE,PARIS 06,"16 RUE BONAPARTE, 75272 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0001-4079,,,B ACAD NAT MED PARIS,Bull.

Many metals have been experimented. The best biocompatibility was obtained with pure or mixed titan. Various elements are conditioning the OI : the surface condition of the implant, the coating through hydroxylapatite, the morphology, the length, the diameter. Among surgical factors damaging the OI, the main responsability comes from thermic raising during the drilling of tissu bone cavity. The procedure consists of 2 stages : Ist stage : drilling the cavity and setting the implant under the gum; 2nd stage : after 6 months, uncovering the implant. In implantology, biomaterials have other uses : filling materials of natural or artificially created tissu bone cavities. Main biomaterials used are autogenic bone, substitutes of heterologous tissu bones, coral, hydroxylapatite or tricalcic phosphatic ceramics. Rebuilding of osseous ridges can be well improved by using barriers.","HOP PARIS,COLL MED,PARIS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,ACADEMIE NATL DE MEDECINE,PARIS 06,"16 RUE BONAPARTE, 75272 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0001-4079,,,B ACAD NAT MED PARIS,Bull.

Proliferation of fibroblasts and osteoblasts was measured using incorporation of tritiated thymidine into total DNA. Attachment of cells was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent labelling of vinculin, a component of the cell's focal adhesion plaque. The degree of cell attachment was quantified on the materials by determining the mean number of adhesion plaques and using an image analysis system to determine the mean total area of plaques per cell. Fibroblasts and osteoblasts responded differently to the materials tested. When grown on PES surfaces, rat tail fibroblasts synthesized significantly greater amounts of DNA than cells on all other surfaces, whilst fibroblasts on UHMWPE synthesized significantly less DNA than cells on all other materials. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the amounts of DNA synthesized by osteoblasts grown on the various materials. Determination of the number of vinculin adhesion plaques per cell and the mean total area of the plaques per cell showed that the attachment of fibroblasts to UHMWPE was significantly reduced compared with other materials. In contrast there was no significant difference in the adhesion of osteoblasts to different materials. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of cells on the materials correlated with the morphometric data. Cells with the greatest number and area of adhesion plaques were well spread and flattened whilst those with the least number of adhesion plaques were more rounded and less spread.","UNIV COLL & MIDDLESEX SCH MED,INST ORTHOPAED,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND; UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,DEPT ANAT,CARDIFF CF1 3YF,S GLAM,WALES",,,,,,,,16,196,199,2,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAR,1995.0,16,4,,,,,287,295,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)93256-D,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QM942,WOS:A1995QM94200004,7772668.0,,,,2019-02-25

In this study, microporous polyurethane arterial prostheses implanted as a canine thoraco-abdominal bypass were explanted after 1 and 12 months and were cleaned without fixation using four different digesting enzyme treatments, including collagenase, pancreatin and trypsin alone and collagenase and pancreatin in series, followed by washing in a solution of Triton X-100 detergent. By following this approach all the fresh tissue attached to the external and internal wails of the prostheses was removed with minimal damage to the underlying synthetic polymer. The morphology of the explanted and cleaned polyurethane prostheses could be obtained readily by light and scanning electron microscopy. Surface microporous features and the presence of polyurethane microfibres that had experienced in vivo biodegradation could therefore be identified easily. The surface and bulk physicochemical properties of the polyurethane polymer were determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the most successful approach for removing fresh tissue and exposing a clean and uncontaminated polyurethane surface was to incubate the explanted samples first in collagenase followed by digestion in pancreatin. This particular cleaning technique has proved valuable in enabling us to monitor small in vivo changes in the surface chemistry and in the bulk microphase segmented structure of polyurethane biomaterials.","UNIV LAVAL,DEPT SURG,QUEBEC CITY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; ST FRANCIS ASSISI HOSP,QUEBEC BIOMAT INST,QUEBEC CITY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA",,,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,15,20,20,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAR,1995.0,16,5,,,,,369,380,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)93854-7,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QM978,WOS:A1995QM97800004,7662822.0,,,,2019-02-25

From the results obtained, it can be seen that: (a) the structure of PL allows its total integration with the reparative tissue, while PTFE becomes encapsulated, on both the subcutaneous and the peritoneal aspects, by orderly connective tissue; (b) the macrophage response, determined on the basis of the presence of labelled macrophages, shows a similar pattern in both biomaterials; and (c) angiogenesis is very intense in the PL mesh, whereas the PTFE prosthesis undergoes almost no vascular colonization.",,"BELLON, JM (reprint author), UNIV ALCALA DE HENARES, FAC MED,DEPT MORPHOL SCI & SURG,SURG RES LAB, CARRETERA N-11, KM 3356, E-28871 ALCALA DE HENARES, SPAIN.",,"Hernando, Antonio/E-2105-2015","Hernando, Antonio/0000-0001-7856-3768; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,19,89,92,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,MAR,1995.0,16,5,,,,,381,387,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)98855-8,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QM978,WOS:A1995QM97800005,7662823.0,,,,2019-02-25

In an attempt to supply a bank of gingiva explants, frozen and freshly excised specimens were cultured in parallel. Optical and scanning electron microscopy showed an early release of cuboidal cells forming a dense layer around the explants. Afterwards, cultures evolved differently. Spread cells grew and migrated more rapidly in fresh than in frozen explant cultures but their adhesion to substratum increased earlier in frozen ones. Epithelial phenotype of cells had been immunologically characterized by using a battery of monoclonal antibodies to cytokeratins (CKs). We found a time increasing expression of CKs 5, 6, 13, 14/15, 16 and 17, whereas amounts of CKs 1, 2, 10 and 11, specific for terminal differentiation, remained constant. The freezing procedure decreased the yield of CKs but did not modify the electrophoretic pattern. These results suggested that the differentiation of epithelial cells might proceed as in vivo. As an application, the cytocompatibility of precious (Au, Pd, Ag) and non-precious (Ni-Cr) alloys was assessed, the reference metals being Ti, which was chosen for its cytocompatibility and Cu, which was chosen for its cytotoxicity. Alloys differed by their ability to modulate cell proliferation and migration. Pd and Au exhibited a high migration potential, whereas Au-Pd and Ti allowed efficient cell proliferation but restricted migration. Reduced migration and proliferation attested the low cytocompatibility of Ag. The toxicity of Cu and Ni-Cr prevented cell migration. These results showed the availability of this method for selecting biomaterials.","UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELLULAIRE EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,9,9,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,MAR,1995.0,5,1,,,,,1,14,,,,,,14,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,RN485,WOS:A1995RN48500001,,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies indicated that bone-bonding but not nonbonding glass ceramics increase the matrix vesicle number, thereby compensating for delayed maturation of the extracellular organelles. The present study assessed whether this was also true for metal implants commonly used in orthopaedics and oral medicine. Bone-bonding titanium (Ti) or nonbonding stainless steel (SS) implants were placed in the right tibias of Sabra rats following ablation of the marrow. At 3, 6, 14, and 21 days postinjury, newly formed endosteal bone in the treated and contralateral limbs was removed and matrix vesicle-enriched membranes isolated. Alkaline phosphatase and phospholipase A(2) specific activities and phosphatidylserine (PS) content were determined and compared with those of a nonsurgical control group. Results show that matrix vesicle alkaline phosphatase and phospholipase A(2) activity and PS content was increased in the Ti-implanted limbs at 6 (peak), 14, and 21 days, although at levels less than observed in normal healing. Alkaline phosphatase activity remained elevated throughout the healing period, In contrast, these parameters were markedly inhibited in the SS-implanted limbs with respect to Ti or to normal healing. Both implants altered the systemic response associated with marrow ablation, but in an implant-specific manner. The results support the hypothesis that cells adjacent to bone-bonding materials can compensate for negative effects on primary mineralization during osteogenesis, whereas cells adjacent to nonbonding materials either do not compensate or are further depressed. The data support the use of the rat marrow ablation model as a tool for rapid, initial assessment of biomaterials in bone.","UNIV TEXAS,HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT ORTHOPAED,SAN ANTONIO,TX 78284",,,,"Dean, David/0000-0002-4512-9065","NIDCR NIH HHS [DE-05937, DE-08603]",,,0,22,22,0,2,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0905-7161,,,CLIN ORAL IMPLAN RES,Clin.

J,"MECHOLSKY, JJ",,,,"MECHOLSKY, JJ",,,FRACTURE-MECHANICS PRINCIPLES,DENTAL MATERIALS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TOUGHNESS,"The principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) were developed in the 1950s by George Irwin (1957). This work was based on previous investigations of Griffith (1920) and Orowan (1944). Irwin (1957) demonstrated that a crack shape in a particular location with respect to the loading geometry had a stress intensity associated with it. He also demonstrated the equivalence between the stress intensity concept and the familiar Griffith criterion of failure. More importantly, he described the systematic and controlled evaluation of the toughness of a material. Toughness is defined as the resistance of a material to rapid crack propagation and can be characterized by one parameter, K-IC. In contrast, the strength of a material is dependent on the size of the initiating crack present in that particular sample or component. The fracture toughness of a material is generally independent of the size of the initiating crack. The strength of any product is limited by the size of the cracks or defects during processing, production and handling. Thus, the application of fracture mechanics principles to dental biomaterials is invaluable in new material development, production control and failure analysis. This paper describes the most useful equations of fracture mechanics to be used in the failure analysis of dental biomaterials.",,"MECHOLSKY, JJ (reprint author), UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611, USA.",,,,,,,20,69,70,1,13,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

The effectiveness of a presently used Clemson bioengineering cleaning (CBC) protocol was evaluated for cleaning three different biomaterials (titanium, aluminum oxide, and polyethylene terephthalate, PET) contaminated with three different contaminants (calcium chloride, zinc chloride, and hexadecane). Radiolabeled tracer analysis (RTA), with the use of liquid scintillation, was used as the surface analytical technique to quantitatively determine the percent contaminant removed from the biomaterial surface. On average, the ultrasonic cleaning step removed 99.96% of all three contaminants from both titanium and aluminum oxide. The CBC protocol did not sufficiently clean PET fabric contaminated with hexadecane leaving 11.76% of the contaminant after the ultrasonic step. With the use of isopropyl alcohol in series with 1% Liquinox, the ultrasonic step cleaned the fabric soiled with hexadecane within 30 min, removing 99.85% of the hexadecane initially on the surface. RTA proved to be an excellent method of quantifying surface contamination on implant materials, and for assessing the effectiveness of cleaning protocols in question.

We identified the plasma proteins adsorbed onto four polymeric fibers used for synthetic ligament replacement: polyarylamide, polylactic acid, polyester, and polypropylene. The adsorbed proteins were eluted and analyzed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fibrinogen, albumin, IgG, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), and lipoproteins ApoA-1 and ApoE were the major proteins adsorbed onto polyarylamide. The three others biomaterials bound albumin, fibrinogen, ApoA-1, and ApoE;however, the proportions of proteins bound to each polymer differed. There was an inverse relationship between ApoA-1 and fibrinogen binding for all four biomaterials; polyarylamide bound a high percentage of fibrinogen, but little ApoA-1; polylactic acid, polyester, and polypropylene bound a high percentage of ApoA-1, but little fibrinogen. These results support suggestions that low fibrinogen adsorption might be due to the preferential adsorption of Apo-1. High fibrinogen binding to polyarylamide ligaments may favor fibroblast adherence, growth, and tissue repair.

Human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) were cultured on titanium (Ti) disks that had been prepared by one of five different treatment regimens. All disks were pretreated with hydrofluoric acid-nitric acid and washed (PT). PT disks were also: washed, and then electropolished (EP); fine sandblasted, etched with HCl and H2SO4, and washed (FA); coarse sandblasted, etched with HCl and H2SO4, and washed (CA); or Ti plasma-sprayed (TPS). Standard tissue culture plastic was used as a control. Surface topography and profile were evaluated by brightfield and darkfield microscopy, cold field emission scanning electron microscopy, and laser confocal microscopy, while chemical composition was mapped using energy dispersion X-ray analysis and elemental distribution determined using Auger electron spectroscopy. The effect of surface roughness on the cells was evaluated by measuring cell number, [H-3]thymidine incorporation into DNA, alkaline phosphatase specific activity, [H-3]uridine incorporation into RNA, [H-3]proline incorporation into collagenase digestible protein (CDP) and noncollagenase-digestible protein (NCP), and [S-35]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan. Based on surface analysis, the five different Ti surfaces were ranked in order of smoothest to roughest: EP, PT, FA, CA, and TPS. A TiO2 layer was found on all surfaces that ranged in thickness from 100 Angstrom in the smoothest group to 300 Angstrom in the roughest. When compared to confluent cultures of cells on plastic, the number of cells was reduced on the TPS surfaces and increased on the EP surfaces, while the number of cells on the other surfaces was equivalent to plastic. [H-3]Thymidine incorporation was inversely related to surface roughness. Alkaline phosphatase specific activity in isolated cells was found to decrease with increasing surface roughness, except for those cells cultured on CA. In contrast, enzyme activity in the cell layer was only decreased in cultures grown on FA- and TPS-treated surfaces. A direct correlation between surface roughness and RNA and CDP production was found. Surface roughness had no apparent effect on NCP production. Proteoglycan synthesis by the cells was inhibited on all the surfaces studied, with the largest inhibition observed in the CA and EP groups. These results demonstrate that surface roughness alters osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production in vitro. The results also suggest that implant surface roughness may play a role in determining phenotypic expression of cells in vivo.

The experiment was carried out in 25 rats. The mandibular ramus was exposed on one side (experimental side) after elevation of a muscle-periosteal flap. A teflon capsule was placed with its opening facing the periosteum at the subsurface of the raised muscle-periosteal flap after suturing In the contralateral side serving as control, the periosteum of the lateral aspect of the mandibular ramus was left intact. This time the teflon capsule was placed with its opening facing the periosteum left behind at the ramus. The histological analysis demonstrated that in all experimental and control specimens, some bone was produced at 7 days after operation. In the experimental specimens, however, both the incidence and the amount of newly-formed bone in the teflon capsules gradually decreased from 7 to 120 days, while increasing in the control capsules placed over the periosteum. At 120 days, the mean amount of new bone produced in the experimental capsules was 3% (range 0-15%) of the total space created by the capsule, while it was 68% (range 41-85%) for the control capsules. The results demonstrated that substantial amounts of bone can be produced predictably by the placement of an occlusive teflon capsule facing mandibular covered with periosteum.

In contrast to ceramic biomaterials, Polyactive(R) is a flexible material. In a previous three-dimensional finite element analysis study, it was stated that application of a flexible Polyactive(R) coating simulates the function of the periodontal ligament. The topic of this investigation was to compare the bone-bonding capacity of Polyactive(R)-coated titanium implants with hydroxylapatite (HA) coated implants. The implants were inserted bilaterally in the edentulous part of the mandibular bone of 12 goats. After 3 weeks, the implants were in close contact with the cortical bone, but no cortical bone reaction or remodelling was observed. After 9 weeks, an extensive bone reaction was seen around the HA and Polyactive(R)-coated implants and contact was frequently encountered between newly formed bone and the implants. Within the surface of the Polyactive(R) coating, a considerable amount of calcification was present. After 25 weeks, cortical remodelling was still apparent. A striking finding was the apparent association between osteon formation and calcification within the surface of the Polyactive(R) layer. Back-scatter analysis of the nondecalcified Polyactive(R) bone interface showed the presence of a calcium phosphate layer in the implant material that apparently formed a continuity with the mineral matrix of bone, suggesting bone-bonding. In general, it was observed that the bone reactions to HA and Polyactive(R) were comparable. A swelling of the coating, just beneath the cortical layer (champagne-cork effect) was often seen. This increase in volume, caused by water uptake, might result in a more intimate initial bone/Polyactive(R) contact, as compared with other implant materials.","LEIDEN UNIV, FAC MED, OTOBIOL & BIOCOMPATIBIL LAB, BIOMAT RES GRP, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","MEIJER, GJ (reprint author), UNIV UTRECHT, FAC MED, DEPT ORAL MAXILLOFACIAL SURG PROSTHODONT & SPECIA, UNIV WEG 100, 3584 CG UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS.",,"Meijer, G.J./H-8073-2014","van Blitterswijk, Clemens/0000-0003-2371-4615",,,,34,6,6,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1365-2842,,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The pentahydrate, when stored at relative humidities (RHs) of <60% but >10%, showed no loss of water after 3 months of storage at 30 degrees C. When stored below 10% RH, only one water molecule could be removed over a period of 3 months, whereas within 24 h at 30 degrees C in a vacuum oven, two water molecules were removed with no change in crystal structure. Increasing the temperature to 60 degrees C progressively removed the remaining three molecules, causing the crystal, however, to collapse into an amorphous form identical to one prepared by lyophilization. Rehydration at 30 degrees C, which was sufficient to reduce the glass transition temperature to <30 degrees C, rapidly restored the pentahydrate crystal structure. Rehydration of the methanolate also restored the pentahydrate structure. The significant amount of water accommodated by raffinose in both the crystalline and amorphous forms would appear to make it a potentially useful water scavenger in certain types of dosage forms.","UNIV WISCONSIN,SCH PHARM,MADISON,WI 53706; PURDUE UNIV,SCH PHARM,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907",,,,,,,,13,90,90,0,14,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

For this, carrier materials consisting of bioresorbable polymers, e. g. poly(L[+]-lactic acid) and poly(glycolic acid) can be used. In respect of the biocompatibility of these polymers, the effect of degradation products on chondrocytes is of major interest. The available biomaterials were tested on chondrocytes in form of their monomers, glycolic acid and L(+)-lactic acid. Effects in regard of cell activity were determined with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenytetra zoliumbromide(MTT)test. A non-pH-effect was examined by buffering with concentrated NaOH. In a short-term testing with increasing monomer concentrations as well as in a test over a twelve-day period, L(+)-lactic acid proved to have a lower cytotoxic effect on chondrocytes than glycolic acid. Similar results were obtained with buffered culture media. Therefore, poly(L[+]-lactic acid) can be recommended for the development of chondrocytes-polymer constructs for in-vitro engineering of cartilage tissue.","UNIV MUNICH,HALS NASEN OHREN KRANKENHEITEN KLIN & POLIKLIN,MUNICH,GERMANY",,,,,,,,0,9,11,0,2,GEORG THIEME VERLAG,STUTTGART,"P O BOX 30 11 20, D-70451 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0935-8943,,,LARYNGO RHINO OTOL,Laryngo-Rhino-Otol.,MAR,1995.0,74,3,,,,,183,187,,10.1055/s-2007-997715,,,,5,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,QQ438,WOS:A1995QQ43800010,7755857.0,,,,2019-02-25

A new multi-sample denaturation temperature tester (DTT) has been constructed for rapid determination of the collagen denaturation temperature of natural tissues and collagenous biomaterials. To validate the system, the denaturation temperatures measured for the DTT are compared with results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Data are presented for bovine pericardium in three states with denaturation temperatures ranging from 68 to 85 degrees C: fresh, or crosslinked with glutaraldehyde or the epoxide reagent Denacol EX-512 poly (glycidyl ether). Denaturation temperatures measured by DTT were not significantly different from those measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); however, DSC onset systematically occurred at a slightly lower temperature than that measured by DTT. This result, seen only for fresh tissue is in agreement with earlier experiments using hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) testing. By contrast, DTT and DSC onset were identical for the exogenously crosslinked materials. Since the measured transition temperature was independent of initial load, this variable may be chosen to yield sharper force-temperature transitions with a given sample geometry. This instrument allows accurate assessment of collagen denaturation temperatures for multiple samples in a fraction of the time required by other methods.",,"LEE, JM (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, 170 COLL ST, TORONTO, ON M5S 1A1, CANADA.",,,,,,,30,79,83,0,5,BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD,OXFORD,"LINACRE HOUSE JORDAN HILL, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 8DP",1350-4533,,,MED ENG PHYS,Med.

Thrombin is often used in vitro as a stimulating agent to check the specific functions of cultured endothelial cells. In the present work, and in order to select a thrombin of commercial origin, two criteria were borne in mind: purity towards the presence of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and effectiveness towards VWF release by human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) that have been submitted to four human commercial thrombins. We detected the presence of vWF in some thrombin solutions that have not yet been in contact with HUVEC. The different thrombins contained vWF antigen ranging from less than 0.1 mUnit per NIH unit of thrombin (from Diagnostica Stage and Sigma Chemical Co.) to 10-20 mUnit per NIH unit of Fibrindex (R) thrombin (from Ortho Diagnostic Systems). Thus, if vWF is present in commercial thrombins, it contributes to and overestimates the VWF appearance in the media resulting from cell stimulation. Consequently, we fixed on thrombin from Diagnostica Stage for further studies involving HUVEC on biomaterials.","UNIV BORDEAUX 2,INSERM,U306,F-33076 BORDEAUX,FRANCE; HOP ENFANTS,HEMATOL LAB,F-33076 BORDEAUX,FRANCE",,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1995.0,16,3,,,,,193,199,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)92117-O,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QG850,WOS:A1995QG85000007,7748995.0,,,,2019-02-25

Corroboration of SFM results is achieved using low voltage, high resolution scanning electron microscopy (LVHRSEM) to image the same protein molecule that is seen in the SFM. We obtain accurate height dimensions by SFM complemented by accurate lateral dimensions obtained by LVHRSEM. The use of 14- and 5-nm gold labels to identify specific membrane-bound biomolecules and to provide contrast enhancement with the SFM is explored as a useful adjunct to observation of unlabeled material. It is shown that the labels are useful for locating specific protein molecules on platelet membrane surfaces and for assessing the distribution of these molecules using the SFM. Fourteen nm labels are shown to be visible over the membrane corrugation, whereas 5-nm labels appear difficult to resolve using the present SFM instrumental configuration. When using the 5-nm labels, collateral use of LVHRSEM allows one to examine SFM images at submolecular resolution and associate function with the structures imaged after the SFM experiment is completed.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT ANIM HLTH & BIOMED SCI,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,"Eppell, Steven/0000-0002-0302-1910","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-29586, HL-37351, HL-40047]",,,37,39,40,0,1,BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Defects which cannot be satisfactorily repaired reguine near of an alloplastic tracheal replacement. Previous experimental and clinical experiences in the development of an alloplastic tracheal prosthesis have demonstrated that the main cause for failure is the lack of an epithelial lining of luminal surfaces and inadequate biophysical properties of the prosthesis. With the use of a cell-seeding technique tested in vitro on biomaterials epithelialization of tracheal prostheses can be tested in vivo. In animal experiments isolated respiratory cells were seeded into implanted tubular prostheses of porous polyurethane or expanded polytetrafluorethylene. Light and scanning microscopic investigations then showed the tendency of epithelialization to occur on the luminal surfaces. Vigorous squamous epithelium cell layers that were single and (predominantly) multiple layers were found. Differentiated ciliated or mucous cells were not detected in any case. The present results have shown that epithelialization of incorporated porous implants is possible.

Either polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride tubings were exposed to canine blood for 5, 15, or 60 min at a flow rate of 300 ml/min and then were flushed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cut into 1.5-cm segments, and stored at -70 degrees C. After thawing, each segment was preincubated in 0.5% albumin in PBS to prevent nonspecific staphylococcal attachment to surfaces that were not exposed to blood. Each segment was then incubated with 4 x 10(6) CFU of [H-3] thymidine-labelled S. aureus per mi for 60 min at 37 degrees C in an in vitro adhesion assay. Two site-specific mutants of S., aureus were tested: one specifically defective in adhesion to fibrinogen (Fg(Ad)-def). Compared with their respective parental strains, the Fg(Ad)-def, but not the Fn(Ad)-def, mutant of S. aureus showed a strong (> 80%) decrease in attachment to ex vivo tubings. The adhesion of each strain of S. aureus onto polyethylene was consistently more than twofold higher than the adhesion onto polyvinyl chloride segments exposed to flowing blood for 5 or 15 min, but adhesion became similar to that on polyvinyl chloride after 60 min of exposure. In conclusion, the specific adhesion-defective mutants of S. aureus suggested that fibrinogen was the most active adhesion-promoting protein in a short-term blood-material interaction. The experimental approach described in this study should prove useful for screening materials thought to be resistant to protein-mediated staphylococcal adhesion and colonization.","UNIV GENEVA, APPL PHYS GRP, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT MED MICROBIOL & IMMUNOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV DUBLIN TRINITY COLL, DEPT MICROBIOL, DUBLIN 2, IRELAND; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT CHEM ENGN, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ANIM HLTH & BIOMED SCI, MADISON, WI USA","VAUDAUX, PE (reprint author), UNIV HOSP GENEVA, DIV INFECT DIS, CH-1211 GENEVA 14, SWITZERLAND.",,,,Wellcome Trust; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-29586]; NCI NIH HHS [RFA BCS-91-20660],,,43,128,132,0,6,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,1098-5522,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

The use of a cage permits in a serial fashion a quantitative and qualitative measurement of exudate components formed around an implant. Subcutaneously in rats, caped cages manufactured from stainless-steel mesh were implanted with in vitro predegraded, as-polymerized PLLA, as-polymerized PLLA cylinders, and empty cages serving as controls. In vitro predegradation was used to simulate the degradation products of long-term in vitro degradation. Predegraded PLLA particles were obtained by in vitro hydrolysis at elevated temperatures. The first 7 days of implantation were characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction; the exudate extracted from the cages showed predominantly neutrophils for all types of implants. After day 7, there was a more chronic inflammatory reaction with predominantly macrophages and lymphocytes. There were no significant differences in the total leukocyte concentration or macrophage concentration for any of the cages in the period from 10-21 days. Extracellular enzyme activity also did not show any significant differences among the three types of cages. A possible explanation for the absence of any significant differences could be that the in vitro predegraded particles were sieved before implantation, thus eliminating all small particles (< 70 mu m) that are probably mandatory to provoke an increased cellular reaction.

Monocyte adhesion on surface-modified FEP polymers and cytokines released by monocytes/macrophages (MC/MO) into the culture medium were compared to control tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) at days 1 and 8. On day 1, the neutral surface FEP polymer with incorporated amide (NH2) groups showed the greatest inhibition of adhesion, 89% (P < .01), and cytokine production (IL-1 beta with 58%, IL-6 with 70%, and TNF-alpha with 39%) compared to control TCPS. In contrast, the highly cationic [CONH(CH2CH2NH)(n)CH2CH2NH2] surface did not show significant (P > .01) inhibition of monocyte adhesion and cytokine production. When fibrinogen or IgG was preadsorbed to the surface, the inhibitory effects of the neutral surface FEP polymer on monocyte adhesion and cytokine production were not altered. In addition, other surface-modified FEP polymers showed similar inhibition of monocyte adhesion and cytokine production compared to TCPS. Specifically, as the incorporation of carboxyl (COOH) group content increased on FEP polymer surfaces, monocyte adhesion and cytokine production were also increased on day 1 with IgG preadsorption. On day 8, all surface-modified FEP polymers showed significant (P < .01) inhibition of monocyte adhesion when fibrinogen or IgG was preadsorbed. However, without protein (fibrinogen or IgG) preadsorption, monocyte adhesion was not significantly inhibited compared to control TCPS. In addition, cytokine production detected by ELISAs on day 8 showed no detectable levels of IL-1 beta and significantly decreased levels of IL-6 compared to day 1 for all tested polymers, with or without protein preadsorption. Interestingly, the level of TNF-alpha production on day 8 remained high although not as high as on day 1. Based on these results, we suggest that FEP polymers with neutral hydrophilic surface properties may adhere and activate the least number of monocytes, which are important mediators of biocompatibility.

We have used a very simple, near-physiologic system whereby whole blood, anticoagulated with D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (thrombin inhibitor), contacts materials for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, under low shear. Unlike other tests of platelet compatibility that focus on adherent platelets, this assay evaluates the platelets in the whole blood drained from the tube (1.57 mm internal diameter, 25 cm length) after material contact. We demonstrate for the first time significant materials-induced microparticle formation. One-hour contact with Silastic, polyethylene, and polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel surfaces lead to 30 +/- 1, 33 +/- 4, and 43 +/- 4 x 10(9) microparticles/L, respectively, whereas resting blood samples contained only 10 +/- 1 x 10(9) microparticles/L. In addition, significant increases in activated platelet(s) binding to neutrophils/monocytes after material contact were noted for all surfaces tested. For polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel surfaces a greater than 500% increase in the fluorescent intensity over that of resting whole blood was attained. The addition of monoclonal antibodies to GPIIb/IIIa (A2A9), the tetrapeptide adhesion ligand RGDS (arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine), or the calcium ion chelator ethyleneglycol-bis-(B-aminoethyl-ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to the whole blood before material contact fully inhibited all platelet reactivity noted for all surfaces-platelet microparticles, platelet P-selectin expression, loss of platelets from bulk, and the formation of platelet/leukocyte aggregates-thereby indicating that material-induced platelet activation is a calcium-dependent process involving GPIIb/IIIa receptors.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT MED, TORONTO, ON, CANADA","GEMMELL, CH (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM, 100 COLL ST, TORONTO, ON M5S 1A4, CANADA.",,,,,,,36,116,117,0,4,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

The effects are evidenced by time dependant signal drift (particularly for those devices which are implanted intravascularly). Practical methods to reduce such effects require an understanding of the interface between the electrode and its environment prior to assessment of the potential areas for improvement. Current procedures employed to overcome the observed losses in electrode sensitivity (following exposure to whole blood) include surface modification of the outer diffusion limiting membrane (via variation in film porosity) or even biomimicry of the fluid cell membrane. At amperometric electrodes incorporation of additional inner perm-selective membranes has achieved a reduction in electrode passivation from undesirable surface active compounds as has the use of low polarisation potentials. Other studies have attempted to induce an aqueous barrier between the matrix and the electrode tip which physically prevents passage of cellular components from the sensor surface. Careful choice of the system and materials will ultimately lead to biocompatible non-fouling devices capable of functioning in an array of bio-environments suitable for clinical monitoring of the critically ill patient.","UNIV MANCHESTER,HOPE HOSP,DEPT MED CLIN BIOCHEM,SALFORD M6 8HD,LANCS,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,13,25,25,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0001-5172,,,ACTA ANAESTH SCAND,Acta Anaesthesiol.

The hydroxyapatite microcrystals were synthesized by neutralization reaction of calcium hydroxide suspension and phosphoric acid solution. Sizes of the hydroxyapatite microcrystals were less than 0.1 mu m, and the mean value was 0.05 mu m. The 0.2 ml hydroxyapatite-sol with a concentration of 14.8 mg/ml was injected into medullary cavities of rat femurs. Both sintered hydroxyapatite powder suspension and saline as comparative materials were injected into the medullary cavities in the same way. Reaction of the hydroxyapatite-sol in the bone medullary cavities was investigated histologically using light and transmission electron microscopes. After 3 days, new bone formation was observed by injection of hydroxyapatite-sol, while no bone formation was observed by injection of sintered hydroxyapatite powder and saline. Osteoblasts were observed endocytosing the hydroxyapatite-sol in the medullary cavities of the rats. Macrophages and undifferentiated osteoblasts were found around the hydroxyapatite-sol aggregation by transmission electron microscope. After 5 days, amounts of new bone increased and matured, forming trabeculae. Many osteoblasts were observed in a line along the surface of the bone. On the other hand, 5 days after injection of sintered hydroxyapatite powder and saline no bone formation was observed while at 10 days after injection, some immature new bone formation started to be observed. New bone increased and matured at 15 days postoperatively. From these results, it was concluded that hydroxyapatite sol only quickly promotes the formation of new bone in bone marrow and can be used as injection liquid of new biomaterials for bone formation.","TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,DIV INORGAN MAT,CHIYODA KU,TOKYO 101,JAPAN",,,,,,,,15,8,12,0,3,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The decisive events which control haemocompatibility occur at the molecular level and affect the various subphases of blood theology. This effect on the already complex human blood theology can be used to our advantage in the screening of blood-contacting materials. An attempt has been made in the present work to evaluate the haemocompatibility of materials based on changes in microrheological parameters of human blood. Samples of materials of equal surface area known to be haemocompatible (medical grade silicon, polyvinyl chloride from blood bags) and materials known to be extremely haemo-incompatible (pyrex glass, copper, cotton fabric, all commercial grade) were incubated at 37.4 degrees C in freshly drawn anticoagulated whole human blood, and changes in the haemorheological parameters (whole blood, plasma viscosity, intrinsic viscosity of red cells, platelet aggregation, albumin fibrinogen ratio) have been evaluated. The results of the study show that alterations in the haemorheological parameters are reliable indicators to the compatibility/incompatibility characteristics of well-known substances and that there is a case for haemorheological screening of biomaterials in the overall framework of haemocompatibility tests.","INDIAN INST TECHNOL,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MEMBRANE TECHNOL LAB,BOMBAY 400076,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA; INDIAN INST TECHNOL,SBME,BOMBAY 400076,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA; NATL PLASMA FRACTIONAT CTR,BOMBAY 400012,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA",,,,,,,,14,4,4,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"VAN DIEMENSTRAAT 94, 1013 CN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The polymers were synthesized with C-14 radiolabelled components incorporated into the polyurethane chain and the amount of radiolabel released during exposure to cells and medium was used as a marker for material degradation. The effect of diisocyanate, soft segment and chain extender chemistry on the susceptibility of polymer degradation was examined. All polymers showed a release of material into the tissue culture medium which was unrelated to the cells. A significant cell-dependent release of radiolabel-containing material was found from one of the polymers (a polyester urea-urethane, TDI/ PCL/ED) which increased linearly up to 96 h. The polyether-containing polyurethanes showed no significant cell-mediated degradation under similar conditions as measured by radiolabel release. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the cells adhered to the different polyurethanes. However, no effect of neutrophils on polymer structure could be detected by this technique. The cellular response to each polymer was evaluated by measuring release of elastase-like activity (ELA) into the tissue culture media. After 24 h TDI/PCL/ED showed the highest levels of ELA in the tissue culture medium. When TDI/PCL/ED was incubated with commercial elastase in vitro, a significant release of radiolabel was found which was comparable to the amount of radiolabelled material released from this polymer in contact with the neutrophils in culture. No significant amount of radiolabel was released from the corresponding polyether material (TDI/PTMO/ED) under similar conditions. This study has identified one enzymatic activity (elastase) as a possible contributor to the deterioration of biomedical implants in vivo in that the polymer which elicited the greatest response of ELA also showed release of radiolabel when incubated with elastase in vitro. The use of a live cell culture system to assess the susceptibility of polyurethanes to degradation has provided a significant step forward in understanding the mechanism of biodegradation.","UNIV OTTAWA,DEPT BIOCHEM,OTTAWA,ON,CANADA","LABOW, RS (reprint author), UNIV OTTAWA,OTTAWA CIVIC HOSP,INST HEART,DIV CARDIOVASC DIVICES,1053 CARLING AVE,OTTAWA,ON K1Y 4E9,CANADA.",,,,,,,20,47,48,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JAN,1995.0,16,1,,,,,51,59,,10.1016/0142-9612(95)91096-H,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,QB054,WOS:A1995QB05400008,7718693.0,,,,2019-02-25

As a result, while these devices generally provide effective relief from painful, crippling and life-threatening disorders, they can also induce vulnerability to infection in the recipients. The surfaces of the implants are susceptible to colonisation by microbial biofilms. The cells in the biofilms are further protected against opsonophagocytosis and are also resistant to antibacterials. Device associated infections thus tend to be refractile to antibiotic therapy and in many cases the device has to be removed before the infection will respond to treatment. Infection rates per implantation operation in totally implanted devices, such as, artificial hips and knees, have fallen over the years to 1-2%. Devices that are partly implanted into body cavities or pass transcutaneously into tissues are particularly susceptible to infection. For example, infection rates of 2.3-4 5% have been reported for central-line vascular catheters. The incidence of infection is related to the length of time the device is in place. Infection rates for urethral catheters indwelling for more than 28 days approach 100%. While several ingenious approaches are currently being taken to modify the surfaces of biomaterials, it has not yet proved possible to reduce the deleterious effects on the host or frustrate the surface colonisation mechanisms that microbes have evolved as a basic survival strategy in natural aquatic habitats.","SW TEXAS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SAN MARCOS,TX 78666","STICKLER, DJ (reprint author), UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,SCH PURE & APPL BIOL,POB 915,CARDIFF CF1 3TL,S GLAM,WALES.",,,"McLean, Robert/0000-0002-0610-6143",,,,115,67,68,1,22,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1995.0,5,2,,,,,167,182,,,,,,16,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,RX895,WOS:A1995RX89500007,,,,,2019-02-25

Techniques have been devised for the preparation of sections through these encrustations in situ on the luminal surfaces of catheters and for mapping the distribution of calcium and magnesium in the biofilms. Transmission electron microscopy on these sections showed struvite-like crystals lying in the matrix and in direct contact with the catheter surface. Calcium phosphate (''bioapatite'') was distributed throughout the film and many of these amorphous particles appear to have cells at their cores. Freeze-substituted sections of biofilms also showed electron dense materials around cell-like shapes and X-ray mapping and X-ray scanning transmission microscopy on the catheter biofilms also indicate that mineralization-occurs around the bacterial cells. These observations suggest that in catheterized bladders infected by Proteus mirabilis, bacteria and crystals formed in the urine, adhere to the catheter. Further colonization and growth of the cells on the catheter and crystal surfaces produces the alkaline biofilm which provides the conditions for continued encrustation. The binding of crystals directly onto the catheter and the subsequent bacterial colonization of these crystals has implications for attempts to prevent encrustation by manufacturing catheters from biomaterials impregnated or coated with antibacterials.","UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,SCH PURE & APPL BIOL,CARDIFF CF1 3TL,S GLAM,WALES; OXFORD ANALYT LTD,HIGH WYCOMBE,BUCKS,ENGLAND; UNIV LONDON KINGS COLL,DEPT PHYS,LONDON WC2R 2LS,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,30,18,18,1,8,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1995.0,5,3,,,,,245,253,,,,,,9,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,TM915,WOS:A1995TM91500002,,,,,2019-02-25

It has a distinct microstructure made up of: prepolymerized beads, an interbead matrix polymer, a radiopacifier (barium sulphate (BaSO4) or zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)), and pores or voids; the radiopacifier is. found only in the interbead matrix of the cured bone cement. The mechanism of slow or fatigue crack growth appears to be initial micro-cracking through the interbead matrix, followed by coalescence of the microcracks to form a continuous crack. Thus, distinguishing the interbead matrix from the pre-polymerized beads is important for investigating fatigue crack behavior in bone cement. Backscattered electron (BE) imaging theoretically-facilitates discrimination of the radiopacifier, and thus, interbead matrix polymer, from the prepolymerized beads. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of BE imaging-and secondary electron (SE) imaging to enhance the contrast between the microstructural components in PMMA bone cement. Electron microscopy revealed that: (1) the damage zone in fatigue fracture of PMMA was characterized by microcracks ahead of the crack tip, and (2) in the BE micrographs, it was easy td differentiate the prepolymerized beads from the interbead matrix. Therefore, BE imaging can be successfully used to contrast the radiopacifier with other constituents of the cement.","UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT BIOL SCI,CATONSVILLE,MD 21228","Topoleski, LDT (reprint author), UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT MECH ENGN,5401 WILKENS AVE,CATONSVILLE,MD 21228, USA.",,,,,,,27,3,3,1,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1995.0,5,3,,,,,283,292,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,TM915,WOS:A1995TM91500006,,,,,2019-02-25

This technique may be used nondestructively to analyze tissues, materials, and biomaterial/tissue interfaces. Applications of AE include use as an early warning tool for detecting tissue and material defects and incipient failure, monitoring damage progression, predicting failure, characterizing failure mechanisms, and serving as a tool to aid in understanding material properties and structure-function relations. All these applications may be performed in real time. This review discusses general principles of AE monitoring and the use of the technique in 3 areas of importance to biomedical engineering: (1) analysis of biomaterials, (2) analysis of tissues, and (3) analysis of tissue/biomaterial interfaces. Focus in these areas is on detection sensitivity, methods of signal analysis in both the time and frequency domains, the relationship between acoustic signals and microstructural phenomena, and the uses of the technique in establishing a relationship between signals and failure mechanisms.","UNIV MICHIGAN, BIOENGN PROGRAM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA","Kohn, DH (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH DENT, DEPT BIOL & MAT SCI, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,"CHEN, Jiangang/A-1549-2011",,NIAMS NIH HHS [5-P60-AR20557]; NCRR NIH HHS [2-SO7-RR05321],,,340,9,9,1,14,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",0278-940X,1943-619X,,CRIT REV BIOMED ENG,Crit.

The interface condition takes into account the moisture transfer balance at the moving boundary. The finite element results were compared with existing results for a single phase system for model validation. In the two-phase system, the movement of evaporation front has an appreciable effect on the temperature and moisture distribution inside the porous medium during drying. The effect of the nondimensional heat of vapourization parameter gamma on the evaporation front, temperature and moisture distribution in porous medium was studied. The higher the value of gamma, the slower is the movement of the evaporation front. The temperature decreased and the moisture content increased as the nondimensional vapourization parameter gamma increased.

One of the simplest methods for better quality retention of thermosensitive materials is drying of the materials in a mixture with porous carriers. In order to determine the effect of carriers presence on the mechanism of dehydration process a set of experiments was carried out in a laboratory vibrofluidized bed dryer. The experiments were performed for three different carriers (wheat bran, ground rape and flour). Baker's yeast was taken as an example of a sensitive material. The effect of following parameters on degradation processes was analysed: concentration and kind of a carrier, temperature and flowrate of inlet air and frequency of a vibrated bed. The analysis of the results proves that temperature of inlet air and kind and concentration of a carrier are the most important factors affecting final product quality. The results show that the main effect of a carrier's presence on quality retention comprises changes of a structure of labile material. Sorptional properties of the carrier are less important. In second part of the work dehumidified air was applied as a drying agent to enhance quality retention of biomaterials. Results obtained are encouraging, however this method requires further research.","TIANJIN INST LIGHT IND,DEPT MECH ENGN,TIANJIN 300222,PEOPLES R CHINA","STRUMILLO, C (reprint author), TECH UNIV LODZ,FAC PROC & ENVIRONM ENGN,UL WOLCZANSKA 175,PL-90924 LODZ,POLAND.",,,,,,,7,3,4,0,0,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",0737-3937,,,DRY TECHNOL,Dry.

They cause clinical infections of prosthetic hip joints, heart valves and catheters, Biofilm formation may occur rapidly on contact lenses and their cases and hence contribute to the pathogenesis of keratitis, Formation of biofilms is also implicated in delayed post-operative endophthalmitis and crystalline keratopathy, Bacteria within biofilms are 20-1000 times less sensitive to antibiotic than free-living planktonic organisms, Existing experimental methods for modifying biofilm include the use of macrolide antibiotics that specifically impair biofilm production, and the use of enzymes to digest it, These may have clinical applications, as potential adjunctive therapies to antibiotic treatment, for these resistant infections, In conclusion, biofilm is an important cause of infections associated with biomaterials. Novel strategies are needed to deal with these.","INST OPHTHALMOL,DEPT CLIN SCI,LONDON,ENGLAND; INST OPHTHALMOL,ELECTRON MICROSCOPY UNIT,LONDON,ENGLAND; CITY UNIV LONDON,DEPT OPTOMETRY,LONDON EC1V 0HB,ENGLAND","ELDER, MJ (reprint author), MOORFIELDS EYE HOSP,CITY RD,LONDON EC1V 2PD,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,98,94,99,1,15,ROYAL COLL OPHTHALMOLOGISTS,LONDON,"17 CORNWALL TERRACE, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 4QW",0950-222X,,,EYE,Eye,,1995.0,9,,1,,,,102,109,,10.1038/eye.1995.16,,,,8,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,QK628,WOS:A1995QK62800016,7713236.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

We show here that cells adhere well to pure GA gels; in addition, specific interactions involving matrix receptors can be studied when individual matrix molecules are bound to the gel covalently. When cells are grown on such substrates, morphology is comparable to that observed on ''natural'' matrix gels (reconstituted gels of collagen type I or of Matrigel): rather than being flattened as in monolayer cultures on tissue culture plastic the cells assume a rounded morphology and tend to form tissue-like aggregates. The effects of the artificial matrix gels are discussed in the context of previous publications on cell interactions with the extracellular matrix, suggesting that in addition to specific recognition of matrix molecules the physical properties of ECM by themselves can be decisive for cell differentiation. We conclude that gels of glyoxyl agarose a) provide a useful model to mimic the physical properties of matrix gels without the presence of specific adhesion factors; b) may be useful as a general, non-specific ECM allowing cells to be cultured in vitro under conditions favorable for differentiation; and cf allow to design a variety of ''synthetic'' ECM models composed of a chemically defined gel matrix, which can be supplemented with covalently bound molecules to be recognized by cell surface receptors.",,"HOHN, HP (reprint author), UNIV ESSEN GESAMTHSCH KLINIKUM, INST ANAT, HUFELANDSTR 55, D-45122 ESSEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,44,15,15,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1071-2690,1543-706X,,IN VITRO CELL DEV-AN,In Vitro Cell.

One of the most important areas in which technological advances have significantly enhanced surgery involves the use of synthetic materials for reconstruction of the body. These materials, generally referred to as 'biomaterials', are defined as materials intended to interface with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function of the body. It is important to recognize that biomaterials have rarely been designed specifically for this use. Instead they are generally materials developed with other applications in mind, but which have been found to be appropriate for medical use, often being modified or optimized for these applications. Thus these materials are generally no different in structure and properties to materials used in the chemical, aerospace or nuclear industries. It is the matching of the properties of materials to the specific and, indeed, unique requirements of surgical reconstruction, that is the key to biomaterials science.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,4,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA AEROPORT,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG 110 AVE LOUIS CASAI CP 306, CH-1215 GENEVA AEROPORT, SWITZERLAND",0268-1900,,,INT J MATER PROD TEC,Int.

However, it is difficult to establish whether the process is initiated by a type I electron transfer, or by a type II energy transfer reaction to form singlet oxygen. Usually, the involvement of singlet oxygen in photodamage has been indicated by the inhibition of the biological effect by a competitive physical or chemical singlet oxygen quencher, or by a rate increase in D2O, in which singlet oxygen has a longer lifetime than in H2O. Unfortunately, these techniques are not completely specific for singlet oxygen. Moreover, thermodynamic considerations suggest that photoinduced electron abstraction from appropriate biomaterials could compete with singlet oxygen production under in vivo conditions. This likely source of one electron-oxidized primary radicals, which can provide the precursors of the oxidative damage in phthalocyanine photosensitization, suggests the possiblity of modulated toxicity by interaction with chemical additives.

The immobilization of herapin was carried out by covalent binding with glutaraldehyde as the coupling agent. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and time, were varied to optimize the binding of herapin. The efficiency of the immobilization was monitored with respect to the total amount of coupled herapin with a toluidine blue assay and the anticoagulant activity of immobolized heparin with a factor Xa assay. The hemocompatibility of the modified polylactide was estimated after blood-material contact by the activation of platelets measured with an enzyme immune assay for GMP140. Immobilization at ambient temperature and a reaction time of 2 h resulted in maximal heparin binding, high anticoaylant activity, and low thrombogenicity. Since the remaining unsaturated aldehyde groups of the coupling agent may cause a low hemocompatibiIity of the material, washing of the heparinized polylactide was carried out with ethanol. However, it was shown that washing diminished the anticoagulant activity of heparin and increased the thrombogenicity. The prolonged storage of heparinized polylactide in phosphate buffered saline for 8 days demonstrated that small quantities of herapin were released but the hemocompatibility was further improved, indicated by an increasing anticoagulant potential and a decrease in platelet activiation with incubation time. A comparison of polylactide, heparinized polylactide, polypropylene, and Pellethane(R) with respect to platelet activation by GMP140 assay and scanning electron microscopy, revealed that the heparinization of polylactide substantially improved the hemocompatibility of RESOMER(R) R208, making the material comparable to Pellethane(R).","HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN, SCH MED CHARITE, BIOMAT RES UNIT, D-10098 BERLIN, GERMANY; HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN, SCH MED CHARITE, DEPT INTERVENT RADIOL, INST ROENTGENDIAGNOST, D-10098 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,"Seifert, Barbara/K-7569-2012","Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,33,16,16,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Polymers are the most diverse class of biomaterials. All biomaterials must meet certain criteria and regulatory requirements before they can be qualified for use in medical applications. Biocompatibility is one of the most important requirements. Both nondegradable polymers are designed to degrade in vivo in a controlled manner over a predetermined time. The main mechanism of in vivo degradation of polymers is 'hydrolytic degradation', in which enzymes may also play a role (i.e.'enzymatic degradation'). Both natural e.g., collagen, and synthetic e.g., poly(alpha-hydroxy) acids, biodegradable polymers are used in biomedical applications. Many of the current polymers and processing techniques need to be improved in order to produce polymers with better performance in biological media. An important trend in related research and development is the synthesis of novel polymers, which would exhibit improved biocompatibility, and be bioresponsive.","HACETTEPE UNIV,DIV BIOENGN,ANKARA,TURKEY","PISKIN, E (reprint author), HACETTEPE UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,ANKARA 06532,TURKEY.",,,,,,,63,77,78,2,48,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To better understand the reasons for wear and failure, methods were developed using polarized light microscopic analysis and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging with correlated elemental analysis to distinguish the contributions of wear, creep, and third-body particulate. This study determined that microscopic metal particles (<10 mu m) previously not observed with the stereomicroscope could be easily observed with the BSE technique. BSE imaging identified embedded metal in 5/5 of the tibial and 2/4 of the acetabular inserts, which were thought to be free of metal debris after stereoscopic examination. Correlated elemental analysis showed that the microscopic particles could be traced to the elements known to be present in the porous coatings of the retrieved uncemented implants. Creep was distinguished from wear in the total hip and total knee inserts by using polarized light microscopic techniques. Continued development of polarized light microscopic techniques applied in this investigation should assist biomaterials experts in the future to better distinguish wear and creep in retrieved clinical inserts. The correlated BSE and elemental analysis will assist in determining the roll of microscopic third-body particular in wear and osteolysis in total joint replacement.

Pure nanoapatite cylinders and organoapatite cylinders containing a synthetic nanopeptide were analyzed 28 days after implantation into the spongy bone of Chinchilla rabbits. The experimental techniques used for analysis were light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Both implant types were well incorporated, and interface events were found to be similar to those observed on human bone surfaces with regard to resorption by osteoclast-like cells and bone formation by osteoblasts. Different types of giant cells were observed resorbing the outermost surfaces of implants. There seemed to be both dissolution of the implant and particulate biodegradation leading to less dense implant regions near the interface, whereas the bulk of the implants remained denser. Transmission electron micrographs revealed that bone bonding occurred with and without an afibrillar intervening layer. Given the biologic reaction observed, these implant materials should be suitable for bone replacement and the organoapatite form could be useful for additional functions such as the release of drugs and optimized release of antibiotics, growth factors, or other substances.

However, 4,4'-thio-bis(3-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol), Irganox 1010, and 1330 did not inhibit at any concentrations. When the single-electron oxidation potentials were compared among antioxidants, the electrochemical ease estimated with the first oxidation potential was correlated with the cytotoxic potentials (r = 0.88), but not with the inhibitory activities in an MC assay. The tumor-promoting activity of MBMBP was also investigated using an in vitro, two-stage Balb/c3T3 transformation assay. MBMBP did not show initiating activity, but significant promoting activity at concentrations of both 1 and 2.5 mu g/ml were noted. These concentrations were close to the lowest effective inhibitory concentration (1.3 mu g/ml) of MBMBP in an MC assay. In conclusion, there is a possibility that the phenolic antioxidants that show inhibitory activities in an MC assay contribute to the enhancement of tumor incidence induced by biomaterials.

(1976) to organize the network of complex metabolic reactions occurring in the living cell, employing directed signal how diagram in which the enzyme reaction coefficient was defined as the metabolic transfer coefficient. Using this concept, a metabolic reaction between substrate A and product B could be regarded as a signal transmittance from A to B. A very simple set of linear equations was then derived to analyze the flow directions of the carbon fluxes and the degree of activation of certain metabolic pathways within a recombinant yeast, in which the specific consumption rate of galactose, the specific rate of change of ethanol and the specific uptake rate of oxygen constituted the three input nodes of the metabolic signal transfer system. The output nodes were the specific growth rate of the cells, the specific production rate of the recombinant protein and the specific evolution rate of carbon dioxide. In this may, the effect of the culture conditions on cell growth and recombinant protein production under control of the GAL10 promoter could be characterized in terms of the metabolic pathways based on observable variables such as the cell and product concentrations, and the carbon dioxide and oxygen in the exhaust gas. This approach was successfully applied to an analysis of the metabolic pathways occurring in the fed-batch cultivation of a recombinant yeast where galactose served as both the carbon source for cell growth and as an inducer for expression of the recombinant gene. The expression period was classified into three phases-named the switch, expression, and stationary phases-on the basis of calculations using signal flow equations. In the switch phase, biomaterials for cell growth were found to be synthesized through the TCA cycle and UR loop, and less galactose entered the induction pathway. In the stationary phase, on the other hand, the formation of biomaterials for cell growth occurred mainly through the PP and EMP pathways and the TCA cycle. The degree of activation of the induction pathway was reduced in this phase. Unlike in either of the previous two phases, in the expression phase a significant amount of galactose was directed towards the induction pathway to stimulate the expression of the recombinant gene, and the PP pathway played the major role in the synthesis of biomaterials for cell growth.","KYUSHU INST TECHNOL,DEPT BIOCHEM ENGN & SCI,FUKUOKA 820,JAPAN",,,,,,,,26,18,20,1,3,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

Microbiological specimens such as viruses, bacteriophages, and ordered bacterial surface layers and membranes have played an important role in the development of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in cellular and molecular biology. Early STM studies involving metal-coated bacteriophage T4 polyheads, Methanospirillum hungatei, and Deinococcus radiodurans HPI layer clearly demonstrated that resolution was comparable to TEM on similarly prepared specimens and only limited by metal graininess. However, except for thin films or layers, novel biological information has been difficult to obtain since imaging native surfaces of such biomaterials as proteins or nucleic acids by STM proved to be unreliable. With the development of atomic force microscopes, which allow imaging of similar native structures, SPM applications have widened to include straightforward surface structure analysis, analysis of surface elastic and inelastic properties, bonding force measurements between molecules, and micro-manipulations of such individual molecules as DNA. AFM images have progressed from relatively crude representations of specimen topography to nanometer scale representations of native hydrated surfaces. It appears from the study of microbiological specimens that direct visualization of dynamic molecular events or processes may soon become a reality.","UNIV GUELPH,COLL BIOL SCI,DEPT MICROBIOL,GUELPH,ON N1G 2W1,CANADA","Firtel, M (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO,FAC MED,DEPT MICROBIOL,TORONTO,ON M5S 1A8,CANADA.",,,,,,,111,34,34,0,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0968-4328,,,MICRON,Micron,,1995.0,26,4,,,,,347,362,,10.1016/0968-4328(95)00012-7,,,,16,Microscopy,Microscopy,TN268,WOS:A1995TN26800005,8574524.0,,,,2019-02-25

It was observed that the surface crystallinity of polypropylene films was well correlated with bulk crystallinity. Smaller contact angles of polypropylene films appeared with higher surface crystallinity, which indicates that crystalline regions have higher surface free energy than amorphous regions on these surfaces. Minimum value in both albumin and fibrinogen adsorption was observed on polypropylene surfaces with a particular surface crystallinity (ca. 50%). The control of surface crystallinity including the size and distribution of crystalline and amorphous regions can dominate the fate of plasma protein adsorption.

We then examine its structural organization by utilizing available data from the primary structure, immunochemical properties, structural stability, solubility, microscopic images, X-ray diffraction data, and information on proteolytic fragments. By analyzing the amino acid sequences, we estimate the flexibility and hydropathy along individual polypeptide chains. We inspect the net charge and hydrophobicity of individual structural domains.

Ellipsometry was used for the quantification of adsorbed proteins. Selected proteins were detected with the use of antibodies. Using the lens-on-surface method it was found that the lack of FG (fibrinogen) in serum did not facilitate binding of anti-HSA (albumin), anti-IgG (immunoglobulin G) or anti-HMWK (high molecular weight kininogen) following incubation of serum with silicon oxide surfaces. Instead, the binding of these antibodies was virtually the same in serum as in plasma. Thus it seems that the behavior of fibrinogen in the ''Vroman sequence'' is essentially independent of these other proteins. With the wettability gradient method it was found that binding of anti-HSA increases with increasing incubation time at the hydrophobic end of the gradient when either plasma or serum was used. Anti-FG was found to bind to plasma-incubated gradient surfaces at both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends of the gradient at short incubation time. With prolonged incubation, binding of anti-FG decreased at the hydrophilic end of the gradient. Binding of anti-HMWK occurred mostly at the hydrophilic end of both plasma and serum incubated gradient surfaces with a binding optimum at about 10 min. With prolonged incubation the binding of anti-HMWK decreased. Binding of anti-IgG was relatively low on serum-incubated as well as plasma-incubated gradient surfaces.","LINKOPING INST TECHNOL, DEPT PHYS & MEASUREMENT TECHNOL, INTERFACE BIOL GRP, S-58183 LINKOPING, SWEDEN; MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT CHEM ENGN, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L7, CANADA",,,,,,,,45,8,9,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,0-8412-3304-7,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

Adsorption of serum albumin and gamma-globulin as well as platelet adhesion to the grafted films were studied to evaluate the non-fouling property of the PEG enriched surface layer. It was found that the monomer with the smallest length of PEG chain of only 4 EG units was the most ''inert'' toward the blood components when the graft yield was largely reduced by the use of high concentrations of the chain transfer agent. Staining technique was employed to visualize the graft depth profile and protein penetration into the grafted films. It was concluded that extraordinarily high graft yields were not effective in preventing protein adsorption while very low graft yields were not sufficient to reduce interactions with proteins and platelets.","KYOTO UNIV,BIOMED ENGN RES CTR,SAKYO KU,KYOTO 606,JAPAN",,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0097-6156,,0-8412-3304-7,ACS SYM SER,,,1995.0,602,,,,,,463,477,,,,,,15,"Chemistry, Physical; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Chemical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science,BE38N,WOS:A1995BE38N00033,,,,,2019-02-25

Methods: Both materials were implanted on the scleral surface under the superior rectus to obtain a focal scleral buckling. Histopathologic examination of the 32 eyes was performed with transmission electron microscopy 5 to 8 months after implantation. Results: During the follow-up period, 6 silicone implants were extruded, compared with only one hydrogel implant. Histopathologically, both types of implants were surrounded by a newly formed fibrous capsule. Only the hydrogel implant gave rise to a granulomatous foreign body reaction against its own fragments, however. Conclusion: The main difference between the two types of material was a superficial fragmentation of the hydrogel implants. The reason for this fragmentation is unknown, To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of foreign body giant cell granuloma that developed against a hydrogel implant.","HOP HOTEL DIEU,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,F-75004 PARIS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,0,22,22,0,1,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0275-004X,,,RETINA-J RET VIT DIS,Retin.-J.

At the present time, Dual Energy X Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is the most used technique, and is a safe and short examination. It can assess the quantity of mineral of any region of the body with a remarkable reproducibility (1 to 3 per cent). New machines are improved, and they permit many practical applications beyond the osteoporosis field. Thus, in orthopedics, we can distinguish several interesting topics. Peripheral risk of fracture can be evaluated because of good correlation between bone mineral content and biomechanical properties of bone. Even if a peripheral fracture occurs after a fall, low bone mineral density plays an important role, as in the case of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. In traumatological practice, a DEXA with a specialized advice has to be requested if the traumatism cannot fully explain the occurrence of the peripheral fracture. Low bone mineral density defines an osteoporotic state, with the possibility of selecting adequate therapy. The good reproducibility of the measurement allows early estimation of bone loss following a period of immobilization. Varying models of osteosynthesis can be compared in vivo, to evaluate a decrease of << stress shielding >> bone resorption. The role of stiffness of an implant on regional bone mineral content can be assessed. Likewise, periprosthetic bone mineral content can be measured in various regions, and followed over time. Specific software allows the exclusion of the region where the metallic prosthesis is projected. The reproducibility of this peripheral bone mineral content is 2 to 3 per cent, which individually allows an estimation of variations of more than 5 per cent. It will be possible to evaluate in vivo the influence of various parameters of the prosthesis on bone mineral content in controlled studies, such as the role of the shape, the position, the structure, the coating. Mineral content of biomaterials and bone grafts are taken into account. Focusing the X Ray beam allows ultrahigh resolution. Precise measurements of very small parts of bone such as rodent tibia or vertebra are possible. The good reproducibility (2 per cent) authorizes the evaluation of various parameters which modify bone remodeling, such as immobilization or activity, ovariectomy. Preventive or curative therapeutics which change bone mass can be evaluated in animal pre clinical studies. There are other methods of measurement of bone mineral content. Digitalization of radiographs is not sufficiently accurate and CT Scan generate high levels of radiation. The DEXA is actually the best compromise for an accurate and reproducible measurement of the bone mineral content in vivo. This method will certainly be an important tool in orthopedics for several clinical or animal investigations in the future.",,"MAUGARS, Y (reprint author), CHU NANTES,SERV RHUMATOL,NANTES,FRANCE.",,"Maugars, Yves/C-4026-2015; Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,0,5,5,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

Clinical studies were undertaken to identify prognostic factors and guide selection of the best treatment option for each patient with a ureteric injury, and to determine the feasibility and efficacy of endourological treatment in the management of these injuries. Experimental studies were designed to develop a new surgical bladder elongation technique for the reapir of extensive ureteric injuries and to determine the safety of double-J ureteric stents currently used for endourological procedures. The influence of previous radiotherapy, time of treatment, and site, kind and length of the ureteric injury on treatment outcome was studied in 137 injuries. The length of the injury was found to be the most important prognosticator of treatment outcome, probably because extensive injuries required diversions involving a high failure rate. Previous radiotherapy and late treatment also had negative prognostic significance, probably due to their frequent association with injury length. The feasibility and efficacy of endourological treatment were studied in 30 injuries. Attempt to perform endoscopic ureteric stenting failed in 14 cases. In the 16 successful ones, restoration of normal urinary tract and good long-term results were accomplished in all cases. Endourological treatment appeared to be particularly indicated for short injuries diagnosed early after the trauma. A new bladder elongation technique involving a particular Z-shaped incision of the bladder was studied in sheep. This bladder Z-plasty provided an average of 5.8 cm greater bladder elongation than the bladder psoas-hitch, with no complications or changes in bladder capacity. The effects of various double-J stent materials on pressure conditions in the upper urinary tract; on the urothelium, on urine precipitation (encrustation), and on urinary infection were investigated in vivo, in pig ureters, and in vitro, by cell cultures and bacterial adhesion assays. Pure polyurethane stents were found to cause long-lasting changes of renal pelvic dynamics and, consequently, to have deleterious effects on renal function. Stents made of ''modified polyurethane'' were found to be cytotoxic in vitro. Silicone(TM) and Hydro-Plus(TM) stents appeared to be the safest overall, as they caused less superficial epithelial destruction and host reaction than the others. Silicone(TM) stents, however, were found to be more prone than Hydro-Plus(TM) stents to encrustation. Bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation onto the various stent materials appeared to depend on the properties of the bacteria, particularly the presence of P-fimbriae, rather than on those of the biomaterials. Adhesion of a few bacteria onto indwelling stents seemed to be of no clinical relevance while formation of large biofilms was associated with urinary infection. This study provided prognostic factors for guiding the selection of the best treatment option for each patient. Endourological treatment proved to be simple and effective for short injuries diagnosed early after the trauma. The bladder Z-plasty was found to be safe and effective for the repair of extensive ureteric injuries. Silicone(TM) and Hydro-Plus(TM) ureteric stents appeared to be the safest overall, as they were not cytotoxic, had no deleterious effects on renal function and caused less epithelial destruction and host reaction than the others. Hydro-Plus(TM) stents, however, appeared to be more suitable than Silicone(TM) stents for long-term ureteric stenting, as they were found to be less prone to encrustation.",,"CORMIO, L (reprint author), UNIV BARI, CHAIR UROL R, PZA G CESARE 11, I-70124 BARI, ITALY.",,,,,,,211,2,2,0,3,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",0036-5599,,,SCAND J UROL NEPHROL,Scand.

We performed biocompatibility tests with materials or plasma substitutes by interaction of blood from healthy volunteers and then subjected these blood samples to platelet function analysis (Thrombostat). We tested also the capacity of locally applied hemostatic agents for bleeding control by direct application of these agents onto the Thrombostat measuring cell. The biocompatibility tests with materials exposed to blood appeared very discriminating between compatible and noncompatible materials. The hemostatic capacity of blood exposed to noncompatible materials (assessed by binding of active thrombin) reduced markedly after one hour incubation of the material. The plasma substitutes did not affect hemostasis significantly. However, a blood dilution of 40%, as in cardiopulmonary bypass, increased the time required for closure of the measuring cell by a platelet plug exponentially. Local hemostatic agents could be selected according to their capacity to enhance platelet plug formation. In addition, ADP mixed with the hemostatic agent was most effective in improving capacity. We conclude that platelet function analysis contributes importantly to screening of materials and plasma substitutes with regard to their interaction with primary hemostasis.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT BLOOD INTERACT RES,9712 KZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,1,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"381 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10016",0094-6176,,,SEMIN THROMB HEMOST,Semin.

A significant change in the pH-dependent binding of each of these metals was observed when the cell material was immobilized. These variations in the impact of metal solution pH could not be explained by the Lewis acidity of the metal ions.

This confirms the preparation of molecularly smooth (roughness less than 1.5 nm), flat RC films and allows us to estimate their thickness as 30.5 and 34.0 nm respectively. Well ordered RC deposition took place only onto the ''front'' side of the substrate, which faces the moving barrier in the Langmuir trough. X-ray reflectivity measurements of LB films of RCs from C. aurantiacus show no Kiessig fringes, independent of the side of the glass plate; this can be explained due to the formation of an unordered protein film during LB deposition.

Summary of Background Data, Bone substitutes would be of great interest for PSA. Previous trials began with two kinds of biomaterials: natural coralline calcium carbonate, and phosphate calcium ceramic. Methods. A lumbar PSA was performed in 11 sheep (coral group) and in 9 sheep (BCP group). Sacrifice and biomechanical tests were performed after 1 year. Results.

The purpose of this study was to develop a rat model in which capsular contracture occurred frequently and to determine whether surface texturing had any effect on the incidence or degree of capsular contracture as determined by in vivo biomechanical analysis of tissue modulus and histological examination of the tissue at the capsule-implant interface. A new sublatissimus implantation site in the rat was developed in an attempt to avoid subpannicular placement, which has been associated with inconsistent results because of contracture despite texturing, and a high rate of implant exposure secondary to trauma. Each rat (N = 43) was implanted with two devices-one smooth-surface 6-ml implant and one textured Biocell 6-ml implant-both with remote ports to allow for biomechanical analysis. Evaluation was carried out at 1, 2, and 3 months (n = 10) and 6 months (n = 5). Biomechanical evaluation of the implants was carried out in vivo and anonymously. The animals were then killed, and sectioning of the overlying capsule-implant interface from the dome of the implant was performed. Histological evaluation was carried out anonymously with regards to the implant type. Capsular contracture developed in smooth-surface devices in 95% of sites; this became evident on biomechanical analysis at 2 months and progressed to 3 months, after which it remained relatively stable. Capsular contracture did not develop in textured devices, but in all cases there was tissue adherence of the capsule to the implant at the interface. Histology confirmed disruption of collagen fiber alignment, increased cellularity and vascularity, and overall thinner capsules around the textured Biocell implants. This rat model provides an inexpensive animal model for further investigation of a difficult clinical problem. In vivo biomechanical analysis to determine tissue modulus has again been shown to be a sensitive method of defining overall soft-tissue contracture around implanted biomaterials.","SURG RES LAB,NASHVILLE,TN; BAPTIST HOSP,INST AESTHET & RECONSTRUCT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN; GRAND RAPIDS AREA MED EDUC CTR INC,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,GRAND RAPIDS,MI",,,,,,,,12,32,33,1,2,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",0148-7043,,,ANN PLAS SURG,Ann.

Since complement activation can play a role in this reaction, we checked in vitro the ability of empty alginate-polylysine microcapsules to activate complement. Human serum was incubated with microcapsules, and complement activation was evaluated by two methods: the complement hemolytic activity (CH50) and the assay of the C3adesArg fragment. The occurrence of complement activation in the presence of microcapsules was suggested both by a CH50 decrease and by high C3adesArg levels despite C3adesArg adsorption to the capsule membrane. Capsule membrane protection against the cytotoxic effects of complement was also tested. No hemolysis occurred when microencapsulated sensitized sheep erythrocytes were incubated with activated complement. In conclusion, the microcapsule membrane can protect cells against activated complement fragments.

Scanning electron microscopy observations of the surface of the seeded ceramic disks revealed that cells attached, spread, and proliferated on the material surface. Soaking in cell-free culture medium showed that no change occurred in the surface structure. However, when cultured with bone cells and observed under a transmission electron microscope, an electron-dense layer was noted initially at the surface of the material, before bone formation occurred. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis demonstrated the presence of calcium and phosphorus in this layer. Progressively, during the following days of culture, active osteoblasts synthetized and laid down an osteoid matrix composed of numerous collagen fibrils arranged either parallel or perpendicularly to the first-formed electron-dense layer. Mineralization initiated on the ceramic surface dispersed then along the collagenous fibrils, leading to a mineralized matrix which surrounded the ceramic particles. These results demonstrate the capacity of apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic to initiate biomineralization in osteoblast cultures and to achieve a direct bond between the surface apatite layer of the bioactive glass-ceramic and the mineralized bone matrix.","UNIV PARIS 07,BIOL ODONTOL LAB,PARIS,FRANCE; OSAKA KYOIKU UNIV,FAC ENGN,SAKYO KU,KYOTO 60601,JAPAN; UNIV PARIS 07,BIOL DEV LAB,F-75251 PARIS 05,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,40,42,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0171-967X,,,CALCIFIED TISSUE INT,Calcif.

These carrier materials function as slow-delivery systems for BMP. By combination of BMP with different carrier materials such as various types of calcium phosphate ceramics, collagen or inactive collagenous bone matrix, and other organic and inorganic carriers, the biomaterial can be adapted to clinical demands in a wide range.

Samples of bone were sandwiched between holders of a different material and using this specimen configuration a new technique was developed to test the fracture toughness of the bone interlayer. The effects of different specimens sizes and holder materials were investigated empirically. Using finite element analysis a correction factor was determined to account for the finite thickness of the interlayer and the analytical solutions governing the test specimen were accordingly modified. Bulk compact tension specimens of bone were tested for comparison. Bath wet and dry bone were evaluated and the fracture surface morphology characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate no statistically significant differences between the fracture toughness values obtained from the compact tension and sandwich specimens. The application of this technique to the testing of interfacial bonding between bone and biomaterials is discussed.

In SEM, macrophages with membrane fusion and cytoplasmic spreading were noted on the surfaces of implanted rubber fragments. Specimens of the spleen from animals with implants showed light 3-10-mu m structures that were not observed in those without implants. EDX revealed the presence of silicon both in the rubber fragment and in the spleen of the implanted animals. Both light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed a large number of particles inside giant cells of the spleen.

To accomplish this objective, proper fixation, processing techniques, instrument quality control, and laboratory safety practices should be followed at all times. This paper reviews the methodology that has become standard practice in our laboratory for the evaluation of bone/implant interfaces. A regimen of fluorescent bone markers was used after implant placement to study rates of bone remodeling. At sacrifice, the tissue was perfused or immersed in an aldehyde or alcohol fixative. Implants were retrieved en bloc, radiographs made, and tissues embedded in plastic. Tissue implant blocks were cut longitudinally into 300-400 mu m thick wafers with a low speed saw equipped with a diamond blade. The wafers were glued to plexiglass slides and hand ground to approximately 25 mu m. Wafers were photographed with an epi-fluorescence microscope; radiographs were made in an X-ray cabinet; and the sections were stained for light microscopy evaluation. Various histomorphometric methods can be used to determine some variables of tissue remodeling around the implants from photomicrographs. Specimens prepared in this fashion can also be evaluated with a scanning or transmission electron microscope. These combined techniques provide a comprehensive approach for the evaluation of the bone/implant interface.","UNIV IOWA,COLL DENT,DEPT PROSTHODONT,IOWA CITY,IA; UNIV IOWA HOSP & CLIN,DEPT OTOLARYNGOL & PROSTHODONT,IOWA CITY,IA","KRIZAN, ME (reprint author), UNIV IOWA,HOSP DENT,COLL DENT,DIV ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG,N442 DENT SCI BLDG,IOWA CITY,IA 52242, USA.",,,,,,,31,6,6,0,1,NATL SOC HISTOTECHNOLOGY,BOWIE,"4201 NORTHVIEW DR, STE 502, BOWIE, MD 20716-1073",0147-8885,,,J HISTOTECHNOL,J.

A chemico-physical and biological characterization was carried out on these ''bioartificial materials'' made of synthetic and biological polymers. The morphological and chemical properties of the films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The transport properties of these films were tested in liquid systems to evaluate their possible use in dialysis and/or haemodialysis. The biocompatibility was investigated by a haemocompatibility test based on the contact activation of plasma prekallikrein. No particular interaction between the two components was observed. The results of the permeation tests were compared with those obtained using commercial products such as Cuprophane and poly(acrylonitrile) membranes. These tests indicate that the permeability of the blends decreases as the content of the synthetic polymer increases.

The mechanisms involved in this process are only partly understood. STUDY DESIGN: Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) were grown on control polystyrene culture ware and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The binding of monoclonal antibodies against the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and the E-selectin by adherent HSVEC was determined by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were cocultured with HSVEC adherent to ePTFE and leukocyte binding was determined with and without the addition of a protein kinase C inhibitor. RESULTS: HSVEC adherent to ePTFE constitutively bound anti-ICAM-1 antibodies, which were attenuated by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7. HSVEC adherent to ePTFE bound significantly greater numbers of leukocytes than those on control (58 versus 41 percent, p<0.05). Incubation with H-7 decreased leukocyte binding to HSVEC significantly (p<0.005). Coculture of PBL with HSVEC adherent to ePTFE caused a tenfold increase in binding of anti-E-selectin antibodies (p<0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PBL binding to HSVEC adherent to ePTFE is, at least in part, ICAM-1 and E-selectin dependent.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT SURG,DIV GEN SURG,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,AMER COLL SURGEONS,CHICAGO,"54 EAST ERIE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60611",1072-7515,,,J AM COLL SURGEONS,J.

However, we recently proposed and realized a new strategy to design a bioactive material, on which biosignal molecules such as cell-growth-factor proteins and cell-adhesion-factor proteins were immobilized. The immobilized biosignal molecules were not only bioactive without being incorporated into the cell, but also more active than free (soluble) ones. In this review, some evidence to demonstrate that the effect of immobilized biosignal is based on biospecific interactions with cellular receptors is shown. In addition, the explanation for the strong effect of the biosignalling, some efforts to further enhance the effect, and various applications of the biosignal molecules-immobilized biomaterials are described.

PEU inhibited stronger than silicone, and furthermore the monomer of the soft segment of PEU showed the highest inhibitory activities among the constituents. As for the additives, three chemicals among eight antioxidants showed stronger inhibitory activities than BHT, a tumor promotor.

Polymers containing spiroorthocarbonates (SOCs) show promise in this respect, but their toxicology in copolymerized materials has not been explored. In this study, the in vitro toxicology of these materials in homopolymer form and in two trial non-shrinking epoxy co-polymers was evaluated for cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT test to measure the lethality effect on mouse L929 cells. Mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames-Salmonella Test. For comparison, commercial composite and adhesive materials as well as several other materials of current interest in dentistry were also evaluated. Epoxy resin samples containing 5% of either T/T SOC or Dp SOC reduced the cytotoxicity (TC50) from approximately 400 to 800 mu g/200 mu l. The epoxy-spiro copolymers had more favorable TC50 values than the commercial product Super-Bond. They showed TC50 values on the order of 35% greater than Super-Bond and 45% less than Scotchbond 2, the latter two being materials currently used in the clinic. These two comparatives demonstrated dose response curves with lower doses at maximum cell kill values than the spiro materials. The epoxy formulations all showed weak mutagenesis, but this is attributed to the epoxy formulation and not the SOCs. Although considerable toxicology is yet be conducted, these in vitro results suggest that biocompatible copolymer formulations for spiroorthocarbonates are a developmental reality.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108; MIDWEST RES INST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64110","YOURTEE, DM (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,SCH PHARM,TOXICORE LABS,2411 HOLMES ST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108, USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [P01 DE09696, R01 DE08450]",,,17,5,8,0,2,P J D PUBLICATIONS LTD,WESTBURY,"PO BOX 966, WESTBURY, NY 11590",1078-0297,,,RES COMMUN MOL PATH,Res.

The biological interaction between these materials and blood was studied by in vitro and ex vivo methods. Silicone rubber tubes were copolymerized with acrylamide and N-vinylpyrrolidone by radiation-grafting techniques. The irradiation was performed with gamma-rays from a Co-60 source at a constant dose rate (0.2 kGy/h) for various time intervals (4-15 h). To evaluate the antithrombogenicity of the grafted tubes, the surface adsorption of I-125-albumin and I-125-fibrinogen was studied. All graft copolymers show a preference for albumin, and the degree of preference appears to correlate with antithrombogenic tendency. In the ex vivo experiment with animals, tubes were implanted in the carotid artery of dogs and the blood flow in the graft copolymers was detected with an ultrasonic flow meter. The blood flow rate in the ungrafted implants decreased more rapidly (stopped completely after 15 to 210 min) compared to the flow rate in the grafted ones (decreased slowly from 38 to 35 ml/min and 70 to 60 ml/min). There was a direct relationship between both methods in the study of blood compatibility of the materials. The results suggest that the graft copolymers can be used as biomaterials for long-term use in cardiovascular systems.","EFEI, INST CIENCIAS, DEPT CIENCIAS, BR-37500000 ITAJUBA, BRAZIL; IPEN CNEN SP, BR-05508900 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL; INCOR, INST CORACAO, BR-01246903 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,0,ASSOC BRAS DIVULG CIENTIFICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE MEDICINA, SALA 21, 14049 RIBEIRAO PRETO, SAO PAULO, 00, BRAZIL",0100-879X,,,BRAZ J MED BIOL RES,Brazilian J.

These polymers were evaluated with respect to their possible use as radiopaque implant biomaterials-that is, materials that are visible in a noninvasive manner using routine X-ray absorption imaging techniques. Polymer A is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 1 (80 and 20 mol%, respectively). Polymer B was prepared from MMA, 1, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) (mel ratio 65:20:15, respectively). Compound 1 was synthesized from 4-iodophenol and methacryloyl chloride. The resulting polymers were characterized with GPC, DSC, NMR, and by measuring both the advancing and receding contact angles. Thrombogenicity of the polymers was determined by an in vitro thrombin generation test procedure. The maximum concentration of free thrombin was 76 +/- 1 nM for polymer A, and 64 +/- 3 nM for polymer B. The lag times (i.e., time onset of thrombin generation) were 392 seconds for polymer A and 553 seconds for polymer B. For PVC-T, which is known as a passive material, a lag time of 583 seconds was found. This indicates that polymer B is comparable to PVC-T, and more passive than polymer A. Polymer A exhibited minor activation of platelets. Polymer B did not induce platelet activation at all. The polymers exhibited, even as fibers with a diameter of ca. 0.3 mm, good radiopacity with routine imaging X-ray techniques in the clinic. It is argued that polymers A and B-which actually represent a whole family of radiopaque polymeric biomaterials-exhibit promising properties with respect to applications as construction materials for a new generation of endovascular stents.

Using a computer-assisted cell counting method, it was shown that the membrane thickness was a stable parameter that poorly correlated with the other histomorphometric parameters except fibrocyte distance parameters. Macrophages were significant in number only in the short term and were always located at the implant-tissue interface. At 4 weeks, the period corresponding to which macrophages disappeared, fibrocytes were found nearer the interface than at earlier periods and did not migrate for up to 52 weeks, although their densities decreased to 50% of their initial values. Therefore, it can be histomorphometrically confirmed that 1) the presence of an implant induced delay in the healing process; 2) the immune system was not usually involved in the response to bulk metals; and 3) at early time periods, the presence of PMN cells was correlated to the long-term number of macrophages. On the contrary, the histomorphometric findings suggested that around the tested materials, a large number of macrophages did not induce an immediate or a delayed fibrocyte proliferation. If one considers that a low fibrocyte surface density is related to activated cells surrounded by a matrix high in collagen content, then the large number of macrophages induced the stimulation of collagen synthesis by the fibrocytes already included in the membrane. Accordingly, in the short-term, a high fibrocyte density and few macrophages may be a criterion for testing biocompatibility.

However, with rare exceptions, only IOLs designed for adults are currently available. These lenses may be difficult to insert into small eyes. Since the pediatric crystalline lens is smaller than that of adults and because the capsular bag does not continue to grow after lensectomy, it is worthwhile to determine the biomaterials, designs, and sizes that may be appropriate for pediatric implantation. In a study of 50 pediatric eyes obtained postmortem, we have documented an estimated growth curve for the developing crystalline lens between birth and 16 years of age. Ninety percent of crystalline lens growth occurs during the first two years of life. Based on these data and this study using the Miyake posterior view analysis of implanted standard and prototype IOLs, we recommend the following: Clinical trials of capsular IOLs, downsized to approximately 10.0 mm diameter, are appropriate for children under two years of age. Capsular IOLs are defined as flexible open-loop, one-piece, all poly(methyl methacrylate), modified C-loop designs made specifically for in-the-bag placement. Because the rapid growth phase of the lens is complete by the age of two, we believe that downsizing the IOL is not necessary after this age unless axial length measurements indicate an unusually small eye. Standard flexible 12.0 mm to 12.5 mm diameter capsular IOLs can be safely implanted. Such lenses could be tolerated throughout life, obviating the need for later IOL exchange.",,"WILSON, ME (reprint author), MED UNIV S CAROLINA,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,STORM EYE INST,CTR INTRAOCULAR LENS RES,CHARLESTON,SC 29425, USA.",,,,,,,0,57,60,0,0,AMER SOC CATARACT REFRACTIVE SURGERY,FAIRFAX,"4000 LEGATO RD, SUITE 850, FAIRFAX, VA 22030",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Four interrelated properties of biomaterials (chemical composition, surface energy, surface roughness, and surface topography) affect mesenchymal cells in vitro. Attachment, proliferation, metabolism, matrix synthesis, and differentiation of osteoblast-like cell lines and primary chondrocytes are sensitive to one or more of these properties. The nature of the response depends on cell maturation state. Rarely do differentiated osteoblasts or chondrocytes see a material prior to its modification by biological fluids, immune cells and less differentiated mesenchymal cells in vivo. Studies using the rat marrow ablation model of endosteal wound healing indicate that ability of osteoblasts to synthesize and calcify their extracellular matrix is affected by the local presence of the material. Changes in the morphology and biochemistry of matrix vesicles, extracellular organelles associated with matrix maturation and calcification, seen in normal endosteal healing, are altered by implants. Moreover, the material exerts a systemic effect on endosteal healing as well. This may be due to local effects on growth factor production and secretion into the circulation, as well as to the tact that the implant may serve as a bioreactor.

The model proposes a reaction-diffusion mechanism for multiple proteins, involving interactions between diffusive-convective protein transport from the bulk solution and competitive adsorption and displacement kinetics-on the surface. The resulting equations in time and space were solved numerically with a finite difference approach. Using a simulated dilute plasma solution consisting of albumin, immunoglobulin-gamma, and fibrinogen at their physiological proportions, the phenomenon of sequential protein adsorption and displacement on the surface(known as the Vroman effect), was shown. Explanations were obtained for several other phenomena observed by biomaterials researchers studying protein adsorption. The model also allows the study of how the modification of surface parameters can determine adsorption behavior. This study not only demonstrates the complexity of the adsorption process but also shows that it can be quantified by comprehensive models.

We have exploited differently modified polystyrenes, specific component-depleted sera, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to leukocyte integrins to ask what adhesion mechanisms mediate human blood monocyte adhesion to different surfaces in vitro. Preliminary findings are that monocyte interactions with fluorinated, siliconized, nitrogenated, and oxygenated surfaces are reduced by 50-100% when complement component C3-depleted serum is used for adsorption; reductions vary with material surface properties. Adhesion is restored on all surfaces when C3-depleted serum is replenished with purified C3. Monocyte adhesion to serum-adsorbed surfaces is inhibited by mAbs to the leukocyte integrin beta subunit, CD18 (mAbs 60.3 and MHM23), and partially inhibited by a mAb to the a submit, CD11b (mAb 60.1), suggesting adhesive interactions between adsorbed C3bi (the hemolytically inactive form of the C3b fragment) and the leukocyte integrin CD11b/CD18. However, adsorbed fibrinogen reduces the effectiveness of these mAbs, indicating that alternative adhesion mechanisms may operate depending on the propensities of critical adhesion-mediating components to be adsorbed onto different surfaces.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL33849],,,43,133,134,0,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Membrane materials were the uncharged regenerated cellulose, the synthetic polysulphone (PS), a positively charged diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-C), the negatively charged carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and acrylonitrile copolymer (AN). The experimental system involved perfusion with human fresh venous blood through different modules containing the materials in the form of hollow fibre membranes. Extracellular and intracellular aspects of blood reactions after the first contact with the materials were investigated in Ficoll-separated granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Investigations were done by release reactions of platelet activating factor (PAF), oxygen radical (O-2(-)), leukotriene B-4, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6). The intracellular activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was done by mRNA transcription of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG). From the set of parameters, release reactions were only measurable for PAF, PGE(2) and O-2(-) if a second stimulus (phorbol myristate acetate, lipopolysaccharide, zymosan and calcium ionophore) was used after blood-membrane interaction. Although the extent of the release reaction was weak, negatively charged membranes were, in general, more active. All dialysers exhibited the same increase in beta 2-MG mRNA transcription, suggesting that all blood-contacting membranes initiate the gene expression of beta 2-MG at the same level. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-8 mRNAs were demonstrated in the AN and CMC membranes rather than the other materials, which exhibit a lower transcription than the tubing set. As has been found, an enhanced generation of PGE(2) for both CMC and AN membranes supports, therefore, the concept of an effect of the negative charges of the materials in the gene expression of cytokines. However, this initiation does not lead to the generation of cytokines, even after stimulation with pyrogens.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; HANNOVER MED SCH,DEPT NEPHROL,KONSTANTY GUTSCHOW STR 8,D-30623 HANNOVER,GERMANY",,,,,,,,44,11,11,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,969,980,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90077-9,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600003,7530999.0,,,,2019-02-25

The breaking stress for each was determined by means of tensile tests in which a constant strain rate was applied, and a tensile test with graduated stress and relaxation defined the elastic limit, i.e. the point beyond which deformation becomes irreversible. The study of the stress-strain curve during this elastic period enabled us to obtain the mathematical function that governs these reversible deformations, which shows excellence of fit (R(2) > 0.98). The prime derivative at each point of the resulting functions is the elastic modulus, the best parameter for comparing the elasticities of the suture threads. Since breaking stress alone does not suitably define the mechanical quality of a suture, we propose the use of other parameters during the elastic period, such as percentage of elongation at a point 10 times lower than the elastic limit (safety coefficient of 10), and tensile stress and elastic modulus at the said point, which are more reliable in the assessment of the resistance and elasticity of these threads.","CLIN PUERTA HIERRO, SERV BIOSTAT, E-28035 MADRID, SPAIN; ESCUELA SUPER TECN INGN IND, DEPT STRUCT MECH, E-28006 MADRID, SPAIN; INST NACL ESTADIST, E-28046 MADRID, SPAIN","PAEZ, JMG (reprint author), CLIN PUERTA HIERRO, SERV EXPTL SURG, SAN MARTIN PORRES 4, E-28035 MADRID, SPAIN.",,,,,,,16,18,18,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,981,984,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90078-7,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600004,7841295.0,,,,2019-02-25

The structure and properties of collagen fibres are defined by the magnitudes of electrostatic and hydrophobic attractive forces between neighbouring collagen molecules within collagen fibres. The structure and mechanical properties of collagen fibre dispersions were studied by dynamic theological measurements and by polarized microscopy. Rheological measurements were performed over pHs ranging from 6 to 9 and over temperatures ranging from 283 to 298 K. At higher pHs, the fibre dispersions were found to possess more rigid fibres and stronger inter-fibre attractive forces. This response is argued to result from changes in the ionization of amino acid side chains, which result in larger net-electrostatic attractive forces. Raising the temperature caused fibres to rigidify through enhanced hydrophobic attractive forces. Gels formed by lower pH-higher temperature fibre dispersions possess different properties than gels formed at higher pHs and lower temperatures.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BERKELEY,CA 94720; CELTRIX PHARMACEUT INC,SANTA CLARA,CA 95052","ROSENBLATT, J (reprint author), COLLAGEN CORP,2500 FABER PL,PALO ALTO,CA 94303, USA.",,,,,,,35,66,66,3,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,985,995,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90079-5,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600005,7841296.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the present study, machined, electropolished and anodically oxidized implants were prepared, surface characterized and inserted in the cortical bone of rabbits (7 wks and 12 wks). SEM, scanning Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed no differences in surface composition but marked differences in oxide thickness, surface topography and roughness. Light microscopic morphology and morphometry showed that all implants were in contact with bone, and had a large proportion of bone within the threads. The smooth, electropolished implants were surrounded by less bone than the machined implants with similar oxide thickness, (4-5 nm) and the anodically oxidized implants with thicker oxides (21 nm and 180 nm, respectively) after 7 wks. These studies show that a high degree of bone contact and bone formation can be achieved with titanium implants which are modified with respect to oxide thickness and surface topography.

For kinetic and thermodynamic reasons, surfaces are different from the corresponding bulk of the material, and contain reactive (unsaturated) bonds, which in turn lead to the formation of surface reactive layers (e.g., surface oxides on metals) and adsorbed contamination layers. The encounter with the biological environment leads to further surface reactions modifying the surface, and to the adsorption of water, ions, and biomolecules, which are continuously exchanged.

It already occurs in living systems where the dielectric and conductive properties of biomaterials are vital in sustaining activity. The transverse and lateral properties of interfaces, including the effects of molecular ordering, are considered and it is suggested that the advent of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies provides a significant opportunity for nano-metric dielectric studies. An important feature, suggested for future exploitation, is the cross-coupling in interfaces of force fields arising from electrical, mechanical, chemical and entropic potential gradients. Application of these concepts to biology and to the behavior of polymer gels which may lead to development of muscle-like actuators and transducers are considered.

The novel systems combine rhBMP-2 with dry powder microparticles of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The mixture of rhBMP-2 with PLGA microparticles is added to an aqueous solution of biopolymer to yield a semisolid paste. The biopolymers tested include autologous blood clot, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and sodium alginate cross-linked with calcium ion. Insoluble collageneous bone matrix was also studied as a control. Test articles were made at 0-, 10-, and 30-mu g doses of rhBMP-2 and implanted in 8-mm-diameter rat carvarial defects (which will not heal if left untreated). The animals were examined 21 days after implantation by radiography, radiomorphometry, histology, and histomorphometry. All tested materials containing rhBMP-2 restored radiopacity and normal contouring to the calvarial defects. Samples without added rhBMP-2 yielded only soft tissue within the defects. Histology showed restoration of inner and outer bone tables plus marrow constituents. The PLGA microparticles were significantly resorbed at the 21-day time point. Although small differences between delivery systems were evident at 0- and 10-mu g rhBMP-2 doses, all test articles performed essentially equivalently at the 30-mu g dose. Thus, novel delivery systems for rhBMP-2 offer the promise of combining the intrinsic bioactivity of the osteoinductive protein with pharmaceutically acceptable biomaterials.

The polyurethanes were selected to reflect variations in the hard-segment chemistry, soft-segment chemistry, and polyurethane hydrophilicity resulting from combinations of hydrophobic/hydrophilic soft segments. All materials were characterized using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, size exclusion chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The material surfaces were examined both before and after incubation with enzyme and control solutions using scanning electron microscopy. Biodegradation assays were carried out at 37 degrees C using cholesterol esterase (CE) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) under optimal pH conditions for each enzyme. The hydrolytic enzyme (CE) was effective in releasing degradation products that contained hard-segment components from some of the polyurethanes. HPLC analysis of products for a polyesterurethane synthesized with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) suggested that the bulk of the incorporated radiolabeled TDI was still covalently bonded within the cleaved chain segments of the original polymer and was not released as pure toluene diamine (TDA). The data suggest that urethane linkages in the soft-segment domains of phase separated polyetherurea-urethanes may be more prone to cleavage by CE than are the urea/urethane groups in the hard-segment domains. This could be related to the nature of the hard-segment domain structures. The oxidative enzyme (HRP) was not able to induce liberation of radiolabeled segments from either the polyether or polyester-based polyurethanes.

Whether promoting cell adhesion or selectively inhibiting cell-cell aggregation mediated by integrin cell surface receptors, RGD-containing peptides can be rationally designed to incorporate both stability and integrin specificity. Synthetic peptides containing this sequence have been linked to biodegradable biopolymers and introduced for the enhancement of dermal and corneal wound healing. By accelerating the healing reaction using RGD-containing peptides, the quality of regenerated tissue seems to be improved, the extent of fibrosis restricted, and the risk of microbial infection may be reduced. Controlling the degree of fibrosis that often accompanies the healing of wounds and the reaction of tissue to foreign materials can also be achieved by natural antagonists of fibrogenic activity of TGF-beta animal models of kidney fibrosis. These advances in the biotechnology of wound healing and tissue regeneration eventually will have an overall impact on the quality of health care.

We have employed self-assembled lipid microstructures in the development of a number of biomedical material applications. The blood substitute, liposome encapsulated hemoglobin, is being investigated for the in vivo delivery of hemoglobin without many of the inherent toxicities associated with the delivery of free hemoglobin. This investigation is currently focused on demonstrations of efficacy in stressed animal models and on the safety of administering this material in models of sepsis. The synthetic modification of phospholipids to include photopolymerizable moieties such as diacetylenes has resulted in the spontaneous self-assembly of a hollow microcylinder which we are investigating for the controlled release of growth factors in soft tissue regeneration. Self-assembled monolayers are also being explored for the ability to surface modify biomaterials for improved cell adhesion. Photolithographic techniques have been combined with monolayer deposition to fabricate coplanar patterns of cell adhesion and inhibiting moieties. This results in the ability to spatially control the adhesion of cells to biomaterial surfaces. These cell patterns can form the basis for understanding two- and three-dimensional cellular events on the biomaterial surface and for the fabrication of improved cell-based biocompatible surfaces.

During the last few years solid progress has been made in the area of tissue and organ regeneration. This new approach is based on the discovery that certain simple chemical analogs of extracellular matrices synthesized by graft copolymerization of a glycosaminoglycan onto type I collagen can induce synthesis of physiologic tissue in lesions which otherwise heal spontaneously by synthesis of scar tissue. This approach offers serious potential advantages over the alternatives listed above since the graft ''grows out'' of host tissue.

Recent advances in cellular and molecular biology of the growth and differentiation factors have set the stage for a symbiosis of biotechnology and biomaterials. Recent advances permit one to enunciate the rules of architecture for tissue engineering of bone and cartilage. The purification and cloning of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth factors such as platelet derived growth factors (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I) will allow the design of an optimal combination of signals to initiate and promote development of skeletal stem cells into cartilage and bone. Successful and optimal bone and cartilage formation is a synergy of inductive and conductive strategies governed by biomechanics, optimal load bearing, and motion. BMPs function as inductive signals. Biomaterials (both natural and synthetic) mimic the extracellular matrix and play a role in conduction of bone and cartilage. Examples of biomaterials include hydroxyapatite, polyanhydrides, polyphosphoesters, polylactic acid, and polyglycolic acid. The prospects for novel biomaterials are immense, and they likely will be a fertile growth industry. Cooperative ventures between academia and industry and technology transfer from the federal government augur well for an exciting future for clinical applications.

In the case of polymeric elastomers, these iatrogenic effects are likely intermediated by absorbed host proteins that spontaneously bind to the device surface, promoting both bacterial adherence and thrombotic events. We earlier attempted to produce biomaterial surfaces that would selectively bind host albumin because albumin-coated surfaces were known to diminish both coagulation and bacterial adherence. To this end, an albumin-binding high molecular weight dextran:Cibacron blue adduct was bulk incorporated into polyetherurethane (Keogh et al., J Biomed Mater Res 1992;26:441). The modified material bound albumin selectively and reversibly and showed evidence of enhanced biocompatibility. However, similar to 30% of the surface of this material was evidently unmodified and still capable of exerting the above adverse effects. In the present work, we have covalently surface-modified polyetherurethane with sequential additions of acrylamide, amino-propylmethacrylamide, dextran, and Cibacron blue. This derivatized polyurethane preferentially and reversibly binds albumin, even from complex mixtures of proteins such as plasma. Furthermore, this material inhibits the clotting of nonanticoagulated whole human blood (for >16 hours at room temperature), perhaps by virtue of binding and activation of antithrombin III by the sulfonic acid residues on the surface-immobilized Cibacron blue. Finally, such surfaces, especially when bearing bound albumin, diminish the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a pathogen frequently associated with device-centered infections. We conclude that similar albumin-affinity surfaces may hold promise for the development of more biocompatible materials for implantation and blood contact applications.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EXPTL PATHOL, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA; MEDTRONIC INC, MINNEAPOLIS, MN USA",,,,,,,,37,54,56,0,11,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

In order to better understand how the bioavailability of these HBGFs can take part in the regulation of the wound healing processes, we have studied the healing effect of various chemically substituted dextrans (CMDBS) selected for their affinity for HBGFs, alone and in association with HBGFs. The CMDBS was obtained by substitution of methylcarboxylic (CM), benzylamide (B) and benzylamine sulfonate (S) groups in proportion of 83%, 23% and 13% respectively for CMDBS K that we have further used (Mauzac et al., 1985 Biomaterials. 6: 61-63). CMDBS K could 1: potentiate the biological activity of 1 or 2 FGFs, 2: protect 1 and 2 FGFs against thermal or pH inactivation, 3: protect a and b FGFs against proteolytic degradation (Tardieu et al., 1992 J. Cell. Physiol. 150: 194-203). CMDBS K was tested alone in cutaneous and bone wound healing models and for its ability to stabilize FGFs. Rats were punched and skin regeneration was studied by morphometric and histological analysis. The wounds (6 mm diameter) were filled with collagen plaster alone or soaked with CMDBS. CMDBS K in collagen plaster was able to induce a remarkable effect both on the kinetics and on the quality of the restored skirt. These results suggest that endogenous growth factors naturally released during the regeneration process could be trapped, protected and released by CMDBS. Taking note of the ubiquitous distribution of FGFs and their ability to stimulate a wide range of target cells, we have looked at the effect of CMDBS K in a calvarian bone defect healing. Adult rats were trephined (3 mm diameter) and healing of their defects were studied after 21 days. Only those treated with CMDBS show significant new bone formation and filling of defects. In conclusion, biopolymers could be designed to mimic some of the mechanisms regulating the bioavailability of growth factors and hence be used as wound healing agents.","UNIV PARIS 12,CRRET,ETUD CROISSANCE REPARAT TISSULAIRE LAB,F-94010 CRETEIL,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 13,RECH MACROMOLEC LAB,VILLETANEUSE,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 05,PHYSIOPATHOL OSSEUSE LAB,MONTROUGE,FRANCE",,,"Meddahi-Pelle, Anne/B-7821-2013",,,,,10,37,38,0,7,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0344-0338,,,PATHOL RES PRACT,Pathol.

Two tanning protocols were used for the membranes, a new one involving microwaving and glutaraldehyde treatment (NEWGA), and the other, a conventional method using glutaraldehyde treatment at room temperature (OLDGA). Untreated membranes (NONGA) were also implanted. Sections of the implants were examined by light microscopy and with the confocal laser scanning microscope focusing on neovascularization and incorporation of the implant. At 64 days, the smooth sides of NEWGA and OLDGA implants were not well incorporated, with scarring subjacent to the surface and dystrophic calcification of that side of the membrane. At the same time, the rough sides of the NEWGA and OLDGA were not calcified with a giant cell reaction around the porcine collagen. The best incorporation was found in the NONGA membranes with no dystrophic calcification, excellent neovascularization of all layers, and complete remodeling at day 64. After 5 months, the completely remodeled NONGA membrane still could be identified, and the NEWGA and OLDGA membranes were calcified with a giant cell reaction having a dense fibrous capsule. It is concluded that if cross-linking is deemed necessary, the microwave cross-linking method is advisable because in the early stages there is less reactive inflammation around it, and the implant surfaces should be rough with an open structure, making calcification of crosslinked collagen unlikely.

Ellipsometry experiments of the simultaneous adsorption of HSA and either IgG or fibrinogen revealed a preferential adsorption of the latter proteins. This is seen not only from the total adsorbed amount, but also from the adsorbed layer thickness and from the buildup of the adsorbed layer. However, in sequential adsorption experiments, where HSA was first allowed to adsorb, followed by rinsing and addition of either IgG or fibrinogen, the additional adsorption is quite limited. Consequently, when HSA is allowed to adsorb on its own at hydrophobic surfaces, it is not removed by either IgG or fibrinogen to any larger extent. Furthermore, preadsorbed HSA was not exchanged by HSA added after adsorption and rinsing, implying that the mechanism behind this effect is an ''irreversible'' adsorption of HSA at hydrophobic surfaces, possibly originating from a surface-induced conformational change of HSA at these surfaces. Analogous findings were obtained with both methylated and HMDSO-treated surfaces, using both ellipsometry and TIRF.

Furthermore, 0.25 x 10(6) S. aureus were needed to induce a persistent specific inflammatory reaction with high concentrations of lymphocytes, i.e. mainly plasma-cells, at 3 weeks. The results indicate that this model functioned well to obtain the wanted information.

From immunologic studies it is known that inflammatory reactions can be modulated by use of (anti) growth factors or anti-inflammatory drugs. Before this can be employed the role of individual factors (humoral and cellular) involved in the inflammatory reaction against biomaterials has to be studied. In this part of the study the role of macrophages is studied with and without depletion by use of the liposomes-mediated macrophage suicide technique. Crosslinked dermal sheep collagens were used as biodegradable test materials. The results showed that macrophage depletion increases vascularization, and decreases the infiltration of granulocytess into the collagens. The foreign body reaction, i.e. the infiltration of macrophages and giant cells was significantly inhibited, resulting in a strongly delayed degradation time of the biomaterials. However, macrophage depletion did not inhibit attraction of fibroblasts and even resulted in increased formation of autologous rat-collagen, which improved the biocompatibility and the function of the biomaterials as a tempory scaffold.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,CELL BIOL & ELECTRON MICROSCOPY LAB,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,36,14,14,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine variations in the calcium concentration in the culture medium due to calcium release from the pretreated copolymers. Bone marrow cells were cultured on the copolymers for 2 and 3 weeks. Differences in formation rate and mineralization of bone nodules were analysed using LM and TEM techniques. Formation of bone nodules was observed after 2 weeks on non-treated copolymers. However,no mineralization in these bone nodules could be detected during the 3 weeks of this experiment. Addition of calcium ions to the copolymers initially increased the calcium concentration of the culture medium and led to formation of mineralized nodules after 2 weeks. The two precalcified copolymers had different effects on the calcium concentration of the culture medium. Instead of nodules, two or three continuous cell layers were formed and mineralization was observed after 2 weeks. Longer culture periods resulted in more mineralization in close contact with the copolymer surface. Based on the results of this experiment we conclude that the pre-operative addition of calcium ions or calcium phosphate to PEO/PBT copolymers stimulates mineralization in bone marrow cell cultures, which is an indication for better bone-bonding characteristics in vitro",,"GAILLARD, ML (reprint author), LEIDEN STATE UNIV,BIOMAT RES GRP,RIJNSBURGERWEG 10,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,"van Blitterswijk, Clemens/0000-0003-2371-4615",,,,33,5,5,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Human tissue adjacent to commercially pure titanium fracture fixation plates was obtained during routine removal of the plates after 1.5 years of implantation. Tissue samples of 20 patients were examined with both techniques. For monoclonal staining the following antibodies were used: HAM 56 (macrophages), propyl-4-hydroxylase (fibroblasts), CD 20 (B-lymphocytes), CD 2 (T-lymphocytes), CD 25 (activated T-lymphocytes), CD 4 (T-helper/inducer cells), CD 8 (T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells). For the visually controlled evaluation, we observed connective tissue cells (fibrocytes, fibroblasts) 709 +/- 19/mm(2) (mean +/- SEM per mm(2)), macrophages 4.0 +/- 0.9/mm(2) and lymphocytes 48.9 +/- 15/mm(2) With image analysis we found fibroblasts 223 +/- 23/mm(2), macrophages (HAM 56) 112 +/- 16/mm(2), T-lymphocytes (CD2) 100 +/- 10/mm(2), activated T-lymphocytes (CD 25) 49 +/- 6/mm(2). No B-lymphocytes were observed in the tissue samples. The results for macrophages (p = 0.0001) and lymphocytes (p = 0.0001) are statistically significantly higher using the image analysis. The antibody staining method in combination with an image analysis is to be recommended because of the time saved and the more precise identification of cells. Whenever no specific antibodies are available for the structure to be analysed, as in many animal studies, the visual method should be applied.","AO ASIF RES CTR DAVOS,CH-7270 DAVOS,SWITZERLAND; UNIV LIVERPOOL,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778",,,,10,1,1,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Macrophages are one of the cell types involved in both these responses. Initially macrophage infiltration is necessary to phagocytose cellular and other debris which result from implantation of a device. Wound healing can then follow. If, however, phagocytosis cannot be completed the macrophages may become highly activated resulting in a chronic inflammatory response. In this paper we examine the activation of human peritoneal macrophages, cultured on a range of materials, by transmitted and reflected light microscopy. The cells were stained for non-specific esterase (NSE), a macrophage marker and indicator of activation. The results showed that cells adhered to all materials tested, except for polyvinyl chloride. Polypropylene caused the greatest degree of macrophage activation, while hydroxyapatite and polytetrafluoroethylene caused the least activation. Macrophages cultured with metal phagocytosed some of the material. We conclude that this technique gives a good indication of the activated state of these cells and can be used in the assessment of the biocompatibility of materials with respect to the immune system.","ROYAL NATL ORTHOPAED HOSP,IRC BIOMED MAT,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND","MARTIN, M (reprint author), ROYAL NATL ORTHOPAED HOSP,INST ORTHOPAED,BROCKLEY HILL,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) underwent splenectomy or sham operation 7 days prior to the intraperitoneal implantation of rubber drain fragments (7 cm(2)). Bacterial translocation was measured 2 days after rubber drain implantation. The incidence of bacterial translocation was significantly higher in the group with intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation plus sham splenectomy than in the groups with sham splenectomy plus sham implantation, splenectomy plus sham implantation or splenectomy plus rubber drain implantation. An increase in ileal permeability of I-125-human serum albumin was induced by intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation and ameliorated by splenectomy. Splenectomy also improved the impaired intestinal motility induced by intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation. Histological examination revealed a preserved normal mucosal architecture in splenectomized rats. Thus, splenectomy reduced the rate of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal biomaterial implantation.

The black color of the resulting materials indicates the presence of polypyrrole while collagen was verified by amino acid analysis of the hybrids. Collagen incorporation into the hybrid was found to be a function of pyrrole concentration used in the polymerization. When the concentration of pyrrole was high, the collagen loading was low and vice versa. This inverse relationship was also found in the hybrids' electrical conductivity. A 26% collagen content in the hybrid gave a conductivity of 1.4 S cm-1 while a 4% collagen gave a higher value of 62.4 S cm-1. Thermogravimetric data suggest that the two polymers exist in the hybrid as a blend. The nature of the interaction of the components in the hybrid is believed to be strong since collagen could not be extracted despite denaturation with sodium dodecylsulfate.","NATL UNIV SINGAPORE,DEPT CHEM,SINGAPORE 0511,SINGAPORE",,,,,,,,38,12,13,0,3,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

We have recently developed an in vitro test system to evaluate platelet/biomaterial interactions in whole blood. The system consists of a parallel plate flow cell and epifluorescent video microscopy (EVM). A glass coverslip coated with a polymer was incorporated into the flow cell, and blood was perfused using a syringe pump via a polymer-coated PVC tubing connected to the flow cell. Whole human blood was anticoagulated with heparin (2 U/ml), and the platelets were labeled with the fluorescent dye mepacrine (5 mu M). This system permitted real-time and dynamic observations of platelet/biomaterial interactions in whole blood under a defined flow condition. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this system, two different segmented polyether-poryurethanes (SPEUs), PU-PTMG(650) and PU-PTMG(2000), were chosen as test polymers. Surface characteristics verified with electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and contact angle measurements showed similar results in both SPEUs. Blood was perfused at a wall shear rate of 200 s(-1) for 20 min. Excitation light was applied for 2 s at 1 min intervals. The real-time image was then analyzed at each time point for the percentage of surface area of platelet coverage. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) levels were also measured before and after each run. PU-PTMG(650) showed a significantly higher number of adhered platelets than PU-PTMG(2000) at each time point. beta-TG levels of PU-PTMG(650) were also higher than those of PU-PTMG(2000), which is comparable to the results of EVM. Thus, this EVM system has been proven to be an excellent and highly sensitive in vitro analytical method for evaluating platelet/biomaterial interactions.","TERUMO CO LTD,CTR RES & DEV,INST BIOMED SCI,NAKAI,KANAGAWA 25901,JAPAN; WASEDA UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,TOKYO,JAPAN; TOKYO WOMENS MED COLL,TOKYO 162,JAPAN",,,,,,,,27,17,17,1,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

An effective approach for developing a clinically applicable biomaterial is to modify the surface of the material which already has excellent biofunctionality and bulk properties. This review article focuses on the surface modification of polymers by grafting techniques, which have long been known in polymer chemistry but are not yet widely applied to biomaterials. A grafted surface can be produced primarily either by graft polymerization of monomers or covalent coupling reaction of existing polymer molecules onto the substrate polymer surface. The major surface properties that should be modified include two kinds of biocompatibility. One is the surface property that elicits the least foreign-body reactions and the other is the cell- and tissue-bonding capability. In addition, physiologically active surfaces with, for instance, selective adsorbability may be required.

The effect of the extraction of lipids from the tissue employed in porcine valves is assessed in a model of subcutaneous implantation in rats. Tissue from aortic and pulmonary porcine valves was treated with chloroform-methanol and 0.625% glutaraldehyde and was implanted into young rats for periods of 21 and 60 d. The calcium accumulated was then quantified by atomic absorption. The effectiveness of this treatment is demonstrated by the detection of much lower calcium values than in the control group. For aortic valve tissue, the values obtained were 40.5 and 188.1 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight of tissue for implantation times of 21 and 60 d, respectively, versus 5.48 and 1.4 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight of tissue for the same tissue treated with chloroform-methanol, ihe values obtained with pulmonary valve tissue were very similar: 72.46 and 108.06 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight tissue versus 0.67 and 0.80 mu Ca2+/mg dry weight tissue for implantation periods of 21 and 60 d, respectively.

Cells which trafficked to the matrix blocks were recovered and characterized for surface phenotype using iluorescently labelled antibodies and flow cytometry (fluorescence activated cell sorting). Temporal information of the differential recruitment of cells was determined. The basic pattern of recruitment in response to the hydrogels was established and mimicked that seen in a local inflammatory response. Neutrophils (PMN) were rapidly recruited (1 d) followed by macrophages and lymphocytes (1-3 d). Cell surface phenotype studies included the determination of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, Mac-1(+) cells, and immunoglobulin bearing cells. Microscopic analysis revealed numerous activated PMNs and monocyte derived foamy macrophages. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry of frozen sections of the block revealed that macrophages, CD3(+) and natural killer tells were all recruited to the interior of the block. Ultrastructural analysis (transmission electron microscopy) showed highly activated macrophages, with abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles. Cells which remained on the surface of the matrix block were CD44 positive migratory cells. Electron microscopic evidence showed foamy macrophages with a varying degree of involvement with the hydrogel material. Surface scanning electron microscopy revealed numerous fibroblast-like cells coating the surface of the block. We suggest that these methods may be used to address the inflammatory response elicited with a variety of implanted materials such as hydrogels, silicones, ceramics and metals. Furthermore, this model has been useful in determining cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors under similar conditions.","USN,MED RES INST,WOUND REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM,BETHESDA,MD 20889","SPARGO, BJ (reprint author), USN,RES LAB,CTR BIOMOLEC SCI & ENGN,CODE 6900,WASHINGTON,DC 20375, USA.",,,,,,,14,19,20,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,AUG,1994.0,15,10,,,,,853,858,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90042-6,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PC347,WOS:A1994PC34700019,7986951.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the present paper we show that vitrification is indeed necessary. However, dextran, which exists as a glass at a higher temperature than does trehalose and thus might be expected to stabilize liposomes more effectively, preserves DPPC liposomes only when extremely large quantities of the dextran are added. Dextran does not stabilize egg PC liposomes and, in fact, inhibits the stabilizing effects of trehalose. Dextran also does not depress T(m)in the dry phospholipids and shows no interaction with the polar headgroup, as assessed by infrared spectroscopy. Trehalose, by contrast, depresses T(m)in dry egg PC by about 60 degrees C and depresses vibrational frequency of the phosphate in the polar headgroup to the frequency seen in the hydrated lipid, an effect we ascribe to hydrogen bonding between the sugar and the polar headgroup. We conclude that while vitrification may be required it is not in itself sufficient to preserve freeze-dried liposomes.

Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes and the liver was observed in animals from groups 2 and 3, but significantly increased in group 4 with a concomitant elevation of serum levels of TNF and IL-6, as compared with group 1. Histological examination revealed a more pronounced inflammatory reaction in the peritoneum and distal ileum in group 3 than in groups 2 and 3.

The resulting polymers had weight average molecular weights ranging from 120,000-450,000, and their chemical structure was confirmed by elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The polycarbonates were evaluated as degradable biomaterials. Their surface properties were determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and contact angle measurement. The degree of surface hydrophobicity was related to the length of the alkyl ester pendent chain. The tensile properties were dependent on the chemical structure of the polymers: For thin, solvent cast film specimens, the tensile modulus varied from 1.2-1.6 GPa, and the strength at break from 60-220 MPa. The degradation of polymeric films was followed in vitro by measuring changes in mechanical strength for up to 40 weeks, and the decrease in molecular weight and changes in surface chemistry for up to 80 weeks. The length of the pendent chain affected the degradation behavior and strength retention; the polymers with short pendent chains were more readily hydrolyzable. For sterilization, ethylene oxide treatment was less destructive, as judged by molecular weight retention, than gamma-irradiation. Spin-cast films of all tested polycarbonates were not cytotoxic toward cultured rat lung fibroblasts. The cell response was influenced by the chemical structure of the polymer. The least hydrophobic polycarbonate (having a short ethyl ester pendent chain) was a more stimulating substrate for cell growth than the more hydrophobic polymers (carrying longer alkyl ester pendent chains).

Where relative toxicity is important, cytotoxicity testing is an effective way of further ranking the potential products. Though cytotoxicity cannot be used to predict precisely in vivo toxicity, used in this fashion it can be successfully incorporated into the selection procedures of a product research and development programme. Four applications of cytotoxicity testing in an industrial research environment will be discussed. Primary screening of metal complexes for potential antitumour activity by evaluating selective cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumour-derived cell lines. The cytotoxicity of a class of novel gold-phosphine complexes with antibacterial activity was assessed against the CHO cell line in order to select compounds with a favourable in vitro therapeutic index.

This has taken the form of many different assessment criteria, some even attempting some form of 'quantitative' grading index. With the complexity of this response and the availability of high performance computer systems it is not sufficient and no longer necessary to describe a tissue response subjectively. The soft tissue response to a number of implanted materials has been analysed using a combination of immunohistochemistry and image analysis to reproducibly stain and count the cells involved in a soft tissue response to implanted materials, as well as measure their position relative to the implanted material. The combination of cell count and pattern of cell distribution revealed that although the magnitude of the cellular responses changes with respect to time the position of cells with respect to an implanted material does not change significantly over time. The position of cells is controlled more by the type of implant material and the change in subject the material is implanted in.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT STAT & COMPUTAT MATH,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND","HUNT, JA (reprint author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778; Abrams, Keith/0000-0002-7557-1567",,,,10,23,24,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER, BAY 15, SHANNON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE CO, CLARE, IRELAND",0921-8912,,,ANAL CELL PATHOL,Anal.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether phagocytosable particles of hydroxyapatite had an adverse effect on bone ingrowth. Bone harvest chambers were implanted bilaterally in the proximal tibial metaphyses of 13 mature rabbits. The bone harvest chamber has a transverse 1-mm wide pore, providing a continuous canal through the chamber for tissue ingrowth. After an initial 6-week period for osseointegration of the bone harvest chambers, the contents of the canal were harvested at 3- or 6-week intervals. Hydroxyapatite particles (diameter, 5 mu) were mixed with a carrier solution, 1% sodium hyaluronate, and implanted in the canal of one chamber in each animal. The contralateral chamber was implanted with the carrier only and served as a control. Histological sections from the tissue harvested from the chambers were evaluated by light microscopy and histomorphometry, and the area of bone ingrowth was measured as a percentage of total area in each section. At 3 weeks there was more bone in the hydroxyapatite sections than in controls; at 6 weeks there was no difference. Hydroxypapatite particles were incorporated within the matrix of new ingrown bone at both time periods. There was no evidence of granuloma formation or inflammation. Previous studies have shown that particles of high density polyethylene and bone cement adversely affect bone ingrowth in this model.

The purpose of this study was to correlate the size and the orientation of image disturbances observed on specific samples of dental materials with their magnetic susceptibility. The measurement of the magnetic susceptibility was performed in the 10(-5) or 10(-6) range using MRI to establish a classification of dental materials. Methods. Cylindrical dental alloy samples incorporating gold, silver, and palladium were placed in a Pyrex beaker filled with distilled water. Images were performed at 0.13 Tesla using two-dimensional Fourier transformation and projection reconstruction at 360 degrees imaging methods. The magnetic susceptibilities were obtained by measuring distances between spots having the highest intensity on the image. Results. Avery discriminating classification may be established on MRI criteria. This method permits one to determine the dia- or para-magnetic character of the dental materials tested. Only palladium-based alloys have been detected to be paramagnetic with kappa > 0. One of the silver-based alloys did not induce detectable distortion because its susceptibility was very close to that of distilled water. Based on this MRI data, the use of this material may be recommended for applications that may be subjected to MRI evaluation. Significance. With the increasing use of MRI as a diagnostic tool, it is useful to establish a classification of prosthetic biomaterials compatible with MRI.","UNIV LYON 1,LAB RMN,F-69372 LYON 08,FRANCE","BEUF, O (reprint author), UNIV LYON 1,FAC ODONTOL,ETUD SURFACES & INTERFACES ODONTOL LAB,RUE GUILLAUME PARADIN,F-69372 LYON 08,FRANCE.",,"BEUF, Olivier/H-6966-2014",,,,,11,17,18,2,2,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

Antibody-treated platelets were added to microtiter wells coated with fibronectin, fibrinogen, vWF, IgG, vitronectin, albumin, or platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Cr-51-labeled platelet adhesion to matrix proteins was expressed as a percentage of that measured on PPP-coated surface. Platelets adhered to fibrinogen, fibronectin, vWF, or IgG immobilized on polystyrene. Limited binding to either vitronectin or albumin was detected. Binding to fibrinogen and IgG was blocked by mAb 10E5. Binding to IgG was also blocked by mAb IV.3. Binding to fibronectin, reduced in the presence of mAb 10E5, mAb BIIG4, or the polyclonal antiserum A108 alone, was further reduced by combined 10E5 and BIIG4 or 10E5 and A108. Neither mAb 10E5 nor 6D1 alone blocked adhesion to vWF; however, the combination of 10E5 and 6D1 significantly reduced platelet adhesion to this matrix, Finally, platelet adhesion to the plasma-coated surface was reduced by mAbs 10E5 and BIIG4. These results indicate that multiple adhesion receptors can mediate platelet adhesion to matrix proteins immobilized on surfaces.

New hard tissue is formed directly on the hydroxyapatite, whereas a characteristic necrotic area appears under Ca(OH)(2). The differing pulpal reactions to these two capping agents suggest differing cell responses. After isolation and selection of human pulp fibroblasts in vitro, the cells were characterized by their morphology, their high alkaline phosphatase specific activity, and their synthesis of type I and III collagens and fibronectin. They were then incubated in the presence of either hydroxyapatite (1 mg/ml) or Ca(OH)(2) (0.8 mg/ml). With Ca(OH)(2), the cells exhibited dramatical alterations in morphology, DNA synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity and protein synthesis, in accordance with the necrosis observed in vivo. With hydroxyapatite, phagocytic activity of pulpal fibroblasts toward hydroxyapatite particles (<10 mu m) was seen. As a consequence, DNA synthesis was affected. This inhibitory effect was not due to cell damage, as demonstrated by increased [H-3]-proline and [H-3]-leucine incorporation by the cells. There was also an inhibitory effect of hydroxyapatite on alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that the pulp fibroblasts were not in a differentiation stage. In conclusion, compared to the effects of Ca(OH)(2) on human pulp fibroblasts, these data are consistent with the biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite previously described in vivo and testify to the occurrence of a biological response elicited by this synthetic biomaterial.","INST BIOL,INSERM,CJF 9011,F-44035 NANTES,FRANCE","ALLIOTLICHT, B (reprint author), FAC CHIRURG DENT,PL A RICORDEAU,F-44035 NANTES,FRANCE.",,"GREGOIRE, Marc/G-2867-2013","GREGOIRE, Marc/0000-0003-3868-0198",,,,48,25,29,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0003-9969,,,ARCH ORAL BIOL,Arch.

All of these surfaces were covered with their respective oxides formed upon exposure of the metals to air. Quantitative analysis of the number of cells bound per unit area indicates that S. epidermidis (RP12) exhibits greatest adhesion to pure V surfaces. When exposed to surfaces having controlled spatial variations in chemical composition on the 10 mu m scale (microfabricated samples), the bacteria preferentially populate V islands versus Ti or Al substrata. In the case of the biphasic Ti6Al4V alloy, the bacteria tend to adhere to V-rich, mixed phase regions and phase boundaries. These findings demonstrate that enhanced and preferential adhesion of S. epidermidis (RP12) occurs on V surfaces in TI-Al-V metal systems and suggest that bacterial interactions are influenced by surface oxide composition.","MED SCI RES INST,HERNDON,VA 22071; JAMES MADISON UNIV,HARRISONBURG,VA 22801; CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL,S-41296 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN",,,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [AR26957]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM35939],,,31,19,20,1,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUN,1994.0,15,8,,,,,628,634,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90214-3,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,NV145,WOS:A1994NV14500010,7948583.0,,,,2019-02-25

The respective biomaterials were positioned in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber, and exposed to flowing blood for 5 min at wall shear rates characteristic for veins (100/s), medium sized (650/s) and moderately stenosed arteries (2600/s). Blood-material interactions were morphologically quantified as platelet-surface adhesion, thrombus volume and fibrin deposition. Platelet adhesion to Dacron was highest at the lowest shear rate (13%) and decreased with increasing shear (4% at 2600/s). In contrast, platelet adhesion to PTFE was shear rate independent (17-19%), and significantly higher than the adhesion to Dacron at 2600/s (P< 0.05). A hallmark of the platelets adherent to PTFE and Dacron was the large percentage of platelets not spread out on the surface. This indicates that both materials were poor platelet activators, even though immunostaining demonstrated the adsorption of the platelet adhesive proteins von Willebrand factor and fibronectin. Adsorption of fibrinogen was also prevailing on both materials. Virtually no thrombi formed on Dacron, while a few small platelet thrombi were observed on PTFE. Less than 1 % of the Dacron and PTFE surfaces were covered by fibrin, irrespective of the shear rate. Thus, Dacron and PTFE interact differently with flowing non-anticoagulated human blood, and Dacron is apparently the least thrombogenic material.","NYCOMED BIOREG AS,UNIV OSLO,N-0317 OSLO,NORWAY",,,,,,,,31,32,36,1,6,RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH",0957-5235,,,BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN,Blood Coagul.

One of the potential difficulties with absorbable implants is the possible toxicity of the polymeric degradation products especially if they accumulate and become concentrated. Accordingly, material evaluation must involve dose-response toxicity data as well as mechanical properties and degradation rates. In this study the toxicity and rates of degradation for six polymers were determined, along with the toxicity of their degradation product components. The polymers studied were poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), two samples of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) having different molecular weights, poly(ortho ester) (POE), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(hydroxy butyrate valerate) (5% valerate) (PHBV). Polymeric specimens were incubated at 37-degrees-C in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 37-degrees-C) and sterile deionized water. The solutions were not changed during the incubation intervals, providing a worst-case model of the effects of accumulation of degradation products. The pH and acute toxicity of the incubation solutions and the mass loss and logarithmic viscosity number of the polymer samples were measured at 10 days, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Toxicity was measured using a bioluminescent bacteria, acute toxicity assay system. The acute toxicity of pure PGA, PLA, POE, and PCL degradation product components was also determined. Degradation products for PHBV were not tested. PGA incubation solutions were toxic at 10 days and at all following intervals. The lower molecular weight PLA incubation solutions were not toxic in buffer but were toxic by 4 weeks in water. The other materials did not produce toxic responses during the 16-week exposures. The degradation products components in order from most toxic to least toxic are: lactic acid (PLA), epsilon-caproic acid (PCL), glycolic acid (PGA), cyclohexane dimethanol (POE), propionic acid (POE), 1,6 hexane diol (POE), pentaerythritol dipropionate (POE), and pentaerythritol (POE).

Albumin molecules were functionalized by introducing double bonds using glycidyl acrylate. The functionalized albumin was covalently attached to various biomaterial surfaces such as polypropylene, polycarbonate, and poly(vinyl chloride) by gamma-irradiation. Surface-induced platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on the albumin-grafted surfaces was examined using computer-enhanced video microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The amount of the grafted albumin was dependent on the gamma-irradiation dose and the concentration of albumin used for adsorption. The grafted albumin molecules remained on the surface even after exposure to blood for prolonged time periods. This approach was used to graft albumin to polymeric materials of an oxygenator. The albumin grafting resulted in a substantial improvement in blood compatibility as compared to control oxygenators. The covalent grafting of functionalized albumin by gamma-irradiation obviates the need for premodification of chemically inert polymer surfaces. It is useful for albumin grafting to various biomaterial surfaces.

The efficacy of a lubricated cystoscope was evaluated by an in vivo test simulating cystoscope operation. The maximal and the total resistance force on the cystoscope model were found to decrease with the surface lubrication. Histological study revealed that urethral damage caused by rubbing with the cystoscope model was reduced by this lubrication technique.

A four-step detergent and enzymatic extraction process has been developed to remove cellular components from bovine pericardial tissue. The process results in an acellular matrix material consisting primarily of elastin, insoluble collagen, and tightly bound glycosaminoglycans. Light and electron microscopy confirmed that nearly all cellular constituents are removed without ultrastructural evidence of damage to fibrous components. Collagen denaturation temperatures remained unaltered. Biochemical analysis confirmed the retention of collagen and elastin and some differential extraction of glycosaminoglycans. Low strain rate fracture testing and high strain rate viscoelastic characterization showed that, with the exception of slightly increased stress relaxation, the mechanical properties of the fresh tissue were preserved in the pericardial acellular matrix. Crosslinking of the material in glutaraldehyde or poly(glycidyl ether) produced mechanical changes consistent with the same treatments of fresh tissue. The pericardial acellular matrix is a promising approach to the production of biomaterials for heart valve or cardiovascular patching applications.

In the first step the films were made hydrophobic by exposure to a tetrafluoromethane plasma. In the second step hydrophilicity was gradually increased by exposure to an argon plasma. XPS analysis of these films demonstrated that the first step resulted in the incorporation of fluor into the film surface (approximately 50 At.-%). In the second step fluor was almost completely removed from the surface, while the surface oxygen concentration increased from 5 to 20 At.-%. The wettability of the modified films, as characterized by water contact angle measurements, increased as a function of the argon treatment time. The advancing/receding contact angles (Wilhelmy plate method) decreased from 128/83 to 50/2 degrees respectively. In vitro adhesion of granulocytes and lymphocytes to the modified surfaces was studied under static conditions as a function of time. For both types of leukocytes it was found that the number of cells which adhered to the surface within a certain incubation time increased when the surface became more hydrophilic. The number of adherent granulocytes was about 2-3 times higher than the number of adherent lymphocytes. The number of adherent cells which could be predicted from the relationship between leukocyte adhesion and the wettability of the substrates within the series of homologous surfaces corresponded with the number of adherent cells to control surfaces (untreated polyurethane and Teflon).

Stabilization of collagen was performed with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde at acid pH, in the absence or presence of 0.7 M NaCl to control collagen swelling. For each condition, some samples were further treated at neutral pH. These test samples were compared with samples treated with glutaraldehyde at neutral pH and with samples of Omni-flow vascular prosthesis. The effectiveness of the stabilization was examined by amino acid analysis, to assess the extent of modification, isometric tension analysis, to evaluate the extent of crosslinking, compliance and accelerated fatigue testing, to evaluate mechanical properties, and by a rat subcutaneous model to evaluate tissue response and propensity to calcification. The data indicated that effective crosslinking could be achieved at low pH and that this can be increased slightly by the presence of NaCl. At low pH, the extent of calcification was low compared to samples treated at pH 7. Subsequent treatment at pH 7 of samples given an initial low pH glutaraldehyde (GA) treatment generally did not alter shrinkage temperatures although the extent of lysine modification and calcification did increase. In general, a more inflammatory response was observed in samples tanned at low pH, although this was not as severe as responses to untreated tissue implants.

To visualize the cell layer on opaque surfaces, a fluorescent staining method has been developed. The measurements show statistically significant differences between material classes, with the highest degree of adhesion about twice that of the lowest degree of adhesion. The greatest adhesion was observed with metallic materials which exhibit a shear stress to erode cells from the material surface of about 5.65 x 10(-3) N cm(-2). The tensile stress of adhesion (about 2.15 x 10(-2) N cm(-2)) was similar for most materials. The interpretation of the results of jet impingement testing and their relation to in vivo cell and soft tissue adherence to biomaterials merits further investigation.","AO,RES INST,DAVOS,SWITZERLAND","BUNDY, KJ (reprint author), TULANE UNIV,SCH ENGN,NEW ORLEANS,LA, USA.",,"O'Connor, Kim/H-3145-2012",,,,,6,6,6,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

When combined with a biocompatible liquid medium, the material easily flowed through small-gauge needles. When injected beneath the facial skin in rats, a profound macrophage response was initially seen at 30 days accompanied by fibroblast proliferation and new collagen formation. By 1 year, a quescient, noninflammatory cellular response with extensive intermaterial collagen deposition was evident. No adverse reactions were seen in the contralateral facial sites, which were injected with only the liquid medium. These preliminary findings suggest good tissue compatibility of this composite biomaterial and provide further evidence of the significant regulatory role of the macrophage in the tissue response to implanted biomaterials.","INDIANA UNIV,DEPT ORAL PATHOL,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202","EPPLEY, BL (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,MED CTR,DIV PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,702 BARNHILL DR,ROOM 2514,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202, USA.",,,,,,,22,13,13,0,1,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",0148-7043,,,ANN PLAS SURG,Ann.

However, the survival rate of patients with acute hepatic failure remains at approximately 30% and has not improved as expected. Current advances in biotechnology have opened the way for the development of a biological artificial liver, which is called the hybrid artificial liver because it consists of both biological and artificial materials. Isolated hepatocytes have been investigated for use in various types of hybrid artificial liver. In addition, the role of biomatrices, microcarriers, and the microencapsulation technique has been studied with respect to long-term maintenance of hepatocellular function and development of high-density culture systems for hepatocytes. Before clinical application of hybrid artificial liver support systems becomes possible, many problems have to be resolved, including large-scale preparation and long-term preservation of biomaterials, high-density and stable immobilization of biomaterials on artificial materials, control of immunological hazards, biocompatibility, safe transportation and sterilization of biomaterials, and the high cost.

The beta-sheet structure is stable at very low concentrations in water and at high temperatures. Various pH changes at 1.5, 3, 7, and 11 had little effect on the stability of the beta-sheet structure. The beta-sheet structure was not altered significantly even in the presence of 0.1% SDS, 7 molar guanidine hydrochloride, or 8 molar urea. One of the structural characteristics of the EAK16 is its ionic self-complementarity in that ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds between Glu and Lys can form readily between two oligopeptide beta-sheet structures. This structural feature is probably one of the factors that promotes its extreme stability. This is the first example of such an extended ionic self-complementarity in a protein structure. EAK16 and its related peptides may have applications as useful biomaterials. It also offers a good model for studying the mechanism of beta-sheet formation. Because the oligopeptide can self-assemble to form a membranous structure, it may have relevance to origin of life research.

Of particular interest is the study monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the implanted cages containing biomaterials, as macrophages may initiate a wide spectrum of responses upon interaction with a foreign material. In this study, the authors propose a technique using subcutaneous tissue cages in conjunction with cytofluorimetric analysis of exudate leukocytes to evaluate the monocyte/macrophage cell activation in response to different materials. The studies reported here used several materials (thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers) as the challenging agent, to demonstrate whether polymers, chemically different from each other, could differentially activate macrophages to carry out their proinflammatory role more effectively. The materials tested included: poly(etherurethane ureas) (PEUU A'), poly(etherurethane ureas) with a surface active additive, Methacrol(R), (PEUU C'), polymethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyetherimide, (PEI), and polyetheretherketone, (PEEK). For all the tested materials, the maximum numbers of exudate cells and of Ia-positive macrophages were found on day 7, although the entity of the cell increase was associated with the material used for the implant. Similarly, the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages varied according to the specific polymer present in the cages after 7 days. By day 14 the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages decreased with individual exudates showing 19-32% Ia-positive cells depending on the different type of material. Only in the case of PDMS did the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages remain the same as compared with control empty cage macrophages.

This study investigated the role of the host protein fibronectin in promoting adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis to metallic surfaces representing materials used for orthopaedic devices. Pure human fibronectin was adsorbed in vitro onto coverslips (0.8 x 0.8 cm) of stainless steel, pure titanium, or titanium-aluminum-niobium alloy. In vitro bacterial adhesion was promoted more strongly by the metallic surfaces coated with fibronectin than by albumin-coated controls for two strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis. Furthermore, with the fibronectin-coated coverslips, bacterial adhesion to titanium alloy was significantly greater than adhesion to stainless steel. Adhesion of the three staphylococcal strains was promoted more strongly by coverslips explanted from the subcutaneous space of guinea pins and tested under similar conditions than by albumin-coated controls. Incubation of either in vitro fibronectin-coated or explanted metallic coverslips with anti-fibronectin antibodies produced a significant decrease in staphylococcal adhesion. These results suggest that the presence of fibronectin on the surface of implanted metallic devices is an important determinant of colonization of orthopaedic biomaterials by staphylococci.","UNIV HOSP GENEVA,DEPT MED,DIV INFECT DIS,CH-1211 GENEVA 14,SWITZERLAND; UNIV HOSP GENEVA,DEPT SURG,ORTHOPAED CLIN,GENEVA,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,22,49,49,0,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Angle-dependent x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements indicated that EDS was immobilized on glass as a fractional hydrophilic monolayer, and ODDMS and DMS were bound as patchy amorphous hydrophobic multilayers. Neither surface coverage nor thickness of the overlayer seemed to be as important as surface chemistry, or charge, in guiding mammalian cell distribution. These results are consistent with the concept that mammalian cells attach to and are guided by positively charged surfaces.

In this study the function of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) crosslinked with carbodiimide (ENDSC) as repair material for abdominal wall defects in rats was compared with that of commercial hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked HDSC. The results indicate that early after implantation both ENDSC and HDSC functioned well as a matrix for cellular ingrowth. However during further implantation HDSC soon degraded resulting in herniations, while ENDSC showed a delay in the degradation time of at least 20 weeks. ENDSC thereby enabled collagen new-formation and functioned as a guidance for muscle overgrowth.

In this work, the adsorption of plasminogen to silylated silica glass materials has been investigated with the objective of providing data for the development of a profibrinolytic or clot lysing surface for blood-contacting applications. The adsorption of plasminogen from Tris buffer to silica glass, lysine modified silica glass, and its sulfonated silica glass precursor has been investigated. The isotherms (25-degrees-C) suggest high affinity, Langmuir type adsorption. Adsorption capacities are in the order sulfonated silica > lysinized silica > unmodified silica. Estimates of the apparent affinity constants based on the Langmuir equation indicate that the affinity of plasminogen is greater for the lysinized surface than for either the silica glass or sulfonated silica glass. Experiments on the adsorption of plasminogen to the sulfonated and lysinized silica glass in the presence of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), known to interfere with plasminogen binding to lysine, were also carried out. Adsorption plateau values for the sulfonated surface with and without EACA in the buffer were the same. For the lysinized surface, adsorption was reduced in the presence of EACA. Desorption experiments against Tris buffer showed that for the lysinized and sulfonated surfaces, 70-80% of the protein was irreversibly bound, with slightly higher reversibility on the lysinized surface. It is concluded that the mechanisms of adsorption of plasminogen to the lysinized surface and sulfonated surface are different, and that the lysine binding sites of plasminogen may be utilized in its interactions with the lysinized surface.

Light of visible blue wavelengths, 400-500 nm, has been applied at normal angles to 0.2-5.0 mm sections of human dentine and representative ceramic, polymer-ceramic composites and hybrid glass-.polyalkenoate materials. The integrated optical transmission has been determined for each material section. The data have been converted to absorbance values and analysed to check for mathematical conformity to the Beer-Lambert Law. It is found that conformity (typically, P < 0.01) to the linear Beer-Lambert Law is only attained by making a substantial correction for the intensity of light reflected from the surface of aesthetic biomaterials. This is otherwise expressed by distinguishing between true and apparent absorbance. From linear regression of apparent absorbance with section thickness, the intercept depends upon the logarithm of the surface-reflection ratio. This factor ranges from 30% to 90% in the materials investigated. It follows that there is a high degree of inefficency in the transmission of visible light into and through aesthetic biomaterials for the purposes of photoactivation using existing technology. Means by which this limitation and inefficiency may be reduced are discussed.

The silicone-containing elastomers studied included two thermoset amorphous silica reinforced dimethyl methylvinyl siloxane-based polymers which were extruded as Silastic(R) RX-50 Medical Grade Tubing (RX-50) and Silastic(R) Medical Grade Tubing H.P. (HP). They also included three experimental thermoplastic silicone-urea urethane copolymers received as X7-4074 (SP-1), X7-4037 (SP-2), and X7-4943 (SP-3). The RX-50 tubing material showed less thrombus deposition compared to the silicone-urea urethane copolymers. This suggests that the blood-contacting response of a silicone elastomer is strongly affected by the incorporation of the urea urethane segments. Among the silicone-urea urethane copolymers, the SP-3 material showed higher levels of platelet and fibrinogen deposition than the SP-1 and SP-2 materials, whereas the SP-1 and SP-2 samples had similar levels of deposition. These results indicate that the blood-contacting properties of the silicone-urea urethane copolymers were influenced more by the molecular weight of the polydimethylsiloxane than by the type of diol used in the urea urethane segments. The maximal platelet deposition on the poly(vinyl alcohol)-coated silicone was approximately an order of magnitude greater than those on the silicone-containing elastomers indicating that the PVA coating was more thrombogenic.","UNIV DELAWARE,COLL ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; DOW CORNING CORP,MIDLAND,MI 48686; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,"Lin, Jui-Che/C-8230-2012","Lin, Jui-Che/0000-0003-4436-655X",,,,16,0,0,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Bone repair in the drilled hole may be affected by bone damage attributed to drilling, thus influencing the bone response to biomaterials. The drilling parameters (the speed of rotation and irrigation) were investigated histologically. Three holes were drilled in each rabbit tibia with different conditions; three speeds (200, 500 and 5000 r.p.m.) and the use of central irrigation or not. Rabbits were killed immediately, 3 days, 2 weeks or 4 weeks post-operatively. India ink was injected in several rabbits just after drilling to investigate the extent of local ischaemia. The drilling quality was evaluated with regard to hole geometry, initial thermal damage and later bone healing process. For 500 or 200 r.p.m. the initial thermal damage, shown by the degree of ischaemia, was less than for 5000 r.p.m. drilling, but the hole edge was not always cleanly cut. This uneven cut edge was considered not to influence the bone-healing process. Drilling at 200 r.p.m. introduced a lower degree of circularity. The subsequent bone formation was retarded by 5000 r.p.m. drilling, presumably due to thermal damage and vascular obstructions, The irrigation was effective in reducing the ischaemic area. These results suggest that a speed of about 500 r.p.m. may be recommendable for intraosseous implantation of biomaterials. The central irrigation system is considered effective in reducing the ischaemic area.","UNIV PARIS 07,FAC MED LARIBOISIERE ST LOUIS,CNRS,UA 1432,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","OHASHI, H (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,10,10,0,6,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The implantation site is assumed to be one of the factors that influence the bone response to biomaterials. The aim of this study was to investigate the bone-healing process in drilled cortical defects at different sites with respect to time. Sheep metatarsus was implemented, since it is a long straight bone with four flat faces. Thus, the different drilling sites were obtained by changing the longitudinal level (proximal, middle and distal) and bone aspect (anterior, lateral and posterior). Metatarsi were obtained at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months post-operatively and with non-decalcified sections the newly formed bone area was measured using a microscope connected to an image analyser. The rate of bone formation was higher in the anterior aspect (P < 0.05). The new bone did not form concentrically from the hole edge towards the centre, and the principal direction of bone growth was different between the anterior and the posterior aspects (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference with respect to the longitudinal axis. These results indicate that the implantation site must be considered when analysing the bone response to biomaterials implanted in cortical defects.","UNIV PARIS 07,FAC MED LARIBOISIERE ST LOUIS,CNRS,UA 1432,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","OHASHI, H (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,8,1,1,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

In this study, the contact system, in which the activation of factor XII and plasma kallikrein is included, is highlighted. This article describes a simple chromogenic assay to determine the Hageman Factor fragment (HFf, or factor XIIf) and kallikrein activity invitro. The assay is based on conversion of Z-Lys-Phe-Arg-pNA.2HCl to which human factor XIIf and kallikrein appeared to have a high affinity. To discriminate between the serine proteases factor XIIf and kallikrein to cleave this substrate, aprotinin was added to one of two complementary samples. In this in vitro study, standardized disks from glass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polytetrafluoro ethylene (PTFE), and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) were studied for their capacity to generate factor XIIf and kallikrein in plasma. Kaolin was used as positive control. On glass disks the highest and on HDPE the lowest generation of factor XIIf and kallikrein were found, both with a ratio of 1:1. On PDMS and on PTFE disks protease activities were intermediate, but with a factor XIIf and kallikrein activity ratio of 1:2 and 1:4, respectively. Apparently because of the hydrophobic surface character of PDMS and PTFE, these surfaces absorb or fail to produce the factor XIIf. This assay appeared to be discriminative even for materials that are considered mild activators of the contact system and can therefore be used asa standard method to qualify biomaterials. NOTE: Factor XIIf (mel wt. 28,000) is designated in the literature as HFf, beta-factor XIIa, or factor XII(LMW) and factor XIIa (mel wt. 80,000) as HFa; factor XIIa(HMW) or alpha-factor XIIa. To avoid the unfashionable use of beta-factor XIIa or alpha-factor XIIa, we chose in this study the use of factor XIIf and factor XIIa, according to the article by R. A.

In vitro, the four DSC versions were found to be noncytotoxic or very low in cytoxicity. After subcutaneous implantation in rats, hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked DSC (HDSC) seldom induced an increased infiltration of neutrophils or macrophages, as compared with normal wound healing; whereas new formation of collagen was observed. DSC crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GDSC) followed by reaction with NaBH4 shortly after implantation showed an increased infiltration of neutrophils with a deviant morphology. Furthermore, a high incidence of calcification was observed, which may explain the minor ingrowth of giant cells and fibroblasts, and the poor formation of new rat collagen. Acyl azide-crosslinked DSC (AaDSC) first induced an increased infiltration of macrophages, and then of giant cells, both with high lipid formation. AaDSC degraded at least twice as slowly as HDSC and GDSC, finally leaving a matrix of newly formed rat collagen. Samples crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (ENDSC) induced the same mild cellular reaction as HDSC; whereas, similar to AaDSC, the degradation rate was slow and an-optimal rat collagen matrix was formed. Of the crosslinked DSC samples, ENDSC seems most promising for tissue regeneration.

White New Zealand rabbits received intraperitoneal implants of different biomaterials for repair of defects created on the abdominal wall. The following biomaterials were used: polypropylene, polyester, expanded polytetraflueroethylene, polypropylene mesh/polypropylene sheeting (polypropylene mesh covered with polypropylene sheeting on the peritoneal side), polypropylene/silastic, polypropylene/polyglactin, polypropylene/polyglycolic acid, and polypropylene/fibrin. All biomaterials evaluated caused adhesions to the intestines except for polypropylene mesh/polypropylene sheeting and polypropylene mesh/silastic composites. Because adhesion of the intestine to the biomaterial is the first stage of biomaterial-related intestinal fistula, its prevention is logical for the elimination of this complication.

Because neutrophils mediate host defense against infection, the effect of biomaterials on neutrophil superoxide release and the mechanism of that effect were investigated using three materials commonly employed in surgical practice. The graft materials were expanded polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyurethane and woven dacron. Polystyrene, a commonly used laboratory support vessel, was also studied. Both polystyrene and polyurethane were activating, but serum inhibitable, whereas PTFE was nonactivating, and woven dacron was not activating unless serum was present. The signaling mechanisms used by these materials demonstrated time and material dependency. Pertussis toxin inhibition of G protein-dependent activation had little or no effect on biomaterial induced activation, whereas FMLP-induced activation of the same biomaterial-associated cells was inhibited. Protein kinase C inhibition with staurosporine greatly inhibited polystyrene-induced activation, but had only a partial effect with polyurethane and even less effect with the activation associated with serum-treated woven dacron. These studies demonstrated that biomaterial contact-induced neutrophil activation differed from that described for cells in suspension, and showed that activation mechanisms on one material cannot be extrapolated to mechanisms on other materials.

The ion chemistry of macrolides, as determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), is different for ions produced as metallated than those formed as (M + H)+ species. An explanation for these differences is the location of the charge. For protonated species, the charge is most likely situated on a functional group with high proton affinity, such as the dimethylamino group of the amino sugar. The alkali metal ion, however, is bonded to the highly oxygenated aglycone. As a result, the collision-activated dissociation spectra of protonated macrolides are simple with readily identifiable fragment ions in both the high and low mass regions but no fragments in the middle mass range. In contrast, the cationized species give complex spectra with many abundant ions, most of which are located in the high mass range. The complementary nature of the fragmentation of these two species recommends the study of both by MS/MS when determining the structure or confirming the identity of these biomaterials.","UNIV NEBRASKA,MIDWEST CTR MASS SPECT,LINCOLN,NE 68588; SCHERING PLOUGH RES INST,KENILWORTH,NJ",,,,"MacMillan, Denise/0000-0002-8424-6651",,,,46,18,18,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",1044-0305,,,J AM SOC MASS SPECTR,J.

However, wider use has been limited in good part by economic factors, some of which are related to the line-of-sight nature of the beam implantation process. Plasma source implantation (or plasma immersion ion implantation) is intended to remove some of the limitations imposed by directionality of beam systems and also to help provide economies of scale. The present paper will outline relevant technologies and areas of expertise that exist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in relation to possible future needs in materials processing. Experience in generation of plasmas, control of ionization states, pulsed extraction, and sheath physics exist. Contributions to future technology can be made either for the immersion mode or for the extracted beam mode. Existing facilities include the High Power Test Facility, which could conservatively operate at 1 A of continuous current at 100 kV delivered to areas of about 1 m2. Higher instantaneous voltages and currents are available with a reduced duty cycle. Another facility, the High Heat Flux Facility can supply a maximum at 60 kV and currents of up to 60 A for 2 s on a 10% duty cycle. Plasmas may be generated by use of microwaves, radio-frequency induction, or other methods and plasma properties may be tailored to suit specific needs.

In both cases, sensitive and, even more important, selective analytical tools for the determination of individual components are mandatory. However, investigation of complex and often diffuse (bio)chemical systems requires a different analytical approach aimed at the detection of a wide range of compounds rather than a selective analysis of compounds. This requirement is especially true if no prior knowledge exists of the kind of compounds involved in the properties of such systems. The analysis of macromolecular systems or complex matrices consisting of chemical components with strongly diverging physico-chemical properties can often hardly be performed through separation and determination of individual components. Examples of such matrices are bioreactor mixtures, microorganisms, cells of biological origin, body fluids, plant tissues, raw materials for food production, food products, dietary fiber, soil, humic substances, and fossil deposits (1-5). Especially the macromolecular part of such samples contains compounds that are highly involatile, with molecular weights far beyond the mass range of mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometry requires ions in vacuum. This process involves formation of ions from volatile compounds (generally El and Cl processes, or desorption of ions into the gas phase, for example by field desorption (FD) (6, 7) or charged aerosol droplets (thermospray, electrospray, ion spray) for nonvolatile compounds (8). Compounds of medium volatility and relatively high thermostability, usually in the medium molecular weight range, can be analyzed with thermal desorption techniques, such as direct probe mass spectrometry (DP-MS) (3). Apparently, these techniques are not appropriate for direct mass spectrometric analyses of the intact high-molecular-weight and heat-labile compounds of the complex matrices described above. For such samples, thermal degradation techniques (pyrolysis) can be performed to generate more volatile compounds of lower molecular weight that are amenable to mass spectrometric analysis (analytical pyrolysis). Therefore, many analytical profiling methods of (bio)macromolecular matrices are based on analysis of thermally-degraded matrices. Generally, application of such degradation techniques results in mixtures of high complexity. Therefore, advanced analytical equipment is needed to analyze the mixtures generated. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) (4, 9-12), pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC), and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) (5, 13, 14) are the techniques most widely applied in the field of analytical pyrolysis. They offer a powerful approach in that a great variety of compounds can be measured in one analysis and usually limited sample preparations are required. Generally, only small amounts of sample (typically 10-200 mug) are needed (1-5). Important applications are fingerprinting for characterization and differentiation of polymers, biomaterials, and microorganisms using pattern recognition methods (4, 5, 15), and identification of individual compounds in pyrolysates for obtaining insight into the structure of the original (bio)macromolecules (3, 4, 16-18). In the fingerprinting approach, differentiation is frequently based on statistical evaluation rather than on chemical interpretation of differentiating components (15). However, in most applications of this kind, at least global indications are obtained of relevant chemical compounds on which differentiation is based. Comparison of the techniques most widely used in analyses of this type, Py-GC and Py-MS, shows that dedicated Py-MS equipment offers a number of potential advantages (4, 9, 19), such as a high sample throughput, the potential of handling compounds differing to a large extent in polarity and molecular weight (4, 12), the suitability of MS data to computer handling for data analyses, good reproducibility, and a better long-term stability. However, for the identification of a large number of individual compounds in pyrolysates, for example, extended series of isomeric or homologous compounds, Py-GC/MS (5), Py-GC/(HR)MS (14, 17), and Py-GC/MSMS (20) are the techniques of choice, as long as volatile compounds are encountered. Serious limitations are the condensation of nonvolatile, relatively high-molecular-weight, and polar compounds on the inner wall of the glass linear and column and the relatively long analysis times. Recent developments in pyrolysate analysis embrace the application of tandem mass spectrometry (Py-MSMS) (18, 21-25), Py-GC/MSMS (20), and (off-line Py) fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry (FAB/MSMS) (11). Py-MSMS is a powerful method for identifying molecular species directly in pyrolysates and has successfully been applied to the characterization of thermal decomposition products of polymers (21, 23), biopolymers (18, 24), bacteria (22), and algae (25). It is interesting to note that some recent reports show an apparent tendency to characterization of microorganisms using only well-defined chemical marker components (26, 27). The application of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical chromatography (SFC) to high-molecular-weight and polar compounds from pyrolysates has been reported recently (28, 29). In general, the approach requires off-line pyrolysis and pyrolysate derivatization preceding HPLC or SFC separation (29), but some initial results of on-line pyrolysis under SFC conditions with subsequent SFC analysis (Py-SFC) have been reported (28). Especially in SFC analysis of polar compounds, derivatization is required to reduce the polarity (30). Also, the direct monitoring of volatile compounds becomes increasingly important. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS), applying hollow-fiber capillary membranes or membrane sheets, in combination with (tandem) mass spectrometry has recently been developed for the monitoring of mixtures of relatively volatile organic compounds in aqueous solutions, for gas analysis, and for in vivo studies of the formation of low-molecular-weight compounds. These techniques are applied to monitor small molecules in fermentation broths (fermentor control), to study microbial physiology, and for in vivo analysis of blood gases (31, 32). Flow injection/membrane introduction devices have been applied to bioreactor monitoring (33). Because data acquired from (bio)chemical matrices are mostly very complex, data analysis techniques are necessary for an effective evaluation of the analytical output. Already in an early stage of direct mixture analysis, in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the first applications of data preprocessing and pattern recognition techniques were mentioned (4, 34). Data analysis techniques will be discussed in another section of this review. In this article, we will selectively review the use of direct mass spectrometric profiling for the analysis of complex (bio)chemical systems with an emphasis on applications in which pattern recognition techniques have been applied to the evaluation of the resulting profiles. Application of chromatographic separation techniques to mixture analysis is mentioned only occasionally in this review. The direct analysis of polymers by mass spectrometry has been reviewed separately in this journal (3) and, therefore, will not be discussed in this article.",,"TAS, AC (reprint author), TNO,NUTR & FOOD RES INST,POB 360,ZEIST,NETHERLANDS.",,"feng, andrew/F-8487-2014",,,,,148,10,10,3,51,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0277-7037,,,MASS SPECTROM REV,Mass Spectrom.

By applying this correction, we determine a set of values for stress-time which, when compared with those obtained with a non-sutured sample, reveal a significant fall in this ratio and, thus, a decrease in the durability.

Undecalcified sections were examined histologically at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 wk intervals. Resorbable materials (TCP and NC) were totally resorbed by 24 wk. DHA, PHA and HA showed very limited resorption, although there were multinucleated giant cells in contact with PHA and SPHA. There was no histologically detectable bone formation in contact with or near any of the biomaterials tested. However, several particles of NC, and sometimes of PHA, were surrounded by a dense, mineralized matrix.

In this study the contribution that serum fibronectin (Fn) or vitronectin (Vn) make to the attachment and spreading of cells cultured from explanted human bone (bone-derived cells) during the first 90 min of culture was determined for metallic and ceramic surfaces. The requirement for Fn or Vn for attachment and spreading of bone-derived cells onto stainless steel 316 (SS), titanium (Ti) and alumina (Al2O3) and to polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) was directly tested by selective removal of Fn or Vn from the serum prior to addition to the culture medium. Attachment and spreading of bone-derived cells onto SS, Ti and Al2O3 surfaces were reduced by 73-83% when the cells were seeded in medium containing serum from which the Vn had been removed. Cell attachment and spreading on these surfaces when seeded in medium containing Fn-depleted serum (which contained Vn) were not reduced to the same extent as in the medium containing Vn-depleted serum. The bone-derived cells failed to attach to the surfaces to the same extent when seeded in medium containing serum depleted of both Vn and Fn. Our results show that for human bone-derived cells, the attachment and spreading of cells onto SS, Ti and Al2O3 as well as PET during the first 90 min of a cell culture attachment assay are a function of adsorption of serum Vn onto the surface.","CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,SYDNEY LAB,N RYDE,NSW 2113,AUSTRALIA; BROWN UNIV,RHODE ISL HOSP,DEPT ORTHOPAED,PROVIDENCE,RI 02903","HOWLETT, CR (reprint author), UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PATHOL,POB 1,KENSINGTON,NSW 2033,AUSTRALIA.",,"Evans, Margaret/B-3261-2011","Evans, Margaret/0000-0003-3078-1576; Walsh, William/0000-0002-5023-6148",,,,50,136,137,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1994.0,15,3,,,,,213,222,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90070-1,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,MZ910,WOS:A1994MZ91000009,7515290.0,,,,2019-02-25

The nature of the blood response involving interactions of systems, pattern and extent of change, patient status and the influence of the whole device contribute to the complexity. Recognising these, the profile of the blood response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), with respect to type of device, mode of blood flow, duration of the procedure and patient status, has been evaluated by monitoring contact phase activation [Factor XII-like activity (FXIIA)], fibrinolytic activity [Fibrin degradation products (X-FDP's)], complement activation (C3a, C5a), leucocyte activation [Granulocyte elastase (GE)] and platelet and white cell imaging. FXIIA, X-FDP's, and GE rose gradually during CPB, with levels remaining elevated post-operatively for up to 48 h. In contrast, C3a levels rose sharply with no significant elevation in the post-operative period, while C5a did not show significant changes during bypass. The use of pulsatile perfusion resulted, in lesser activation of the parameters, although these were significantly less only for GE. The alterations in FXIIA, X-FDP's, C3a and GE correlated positively with the duration of CPB, with this effect pronounced in the post-operative period for FXIIA, X-FDP's and GE. However, these changes had no apparent influence on clinical outcome and the majority of patients had uncomplicated post-operative recoveries. With respect to the use of bubble/membrane oxygenators, platelet and white cell deposition and the patterns of change for FXIIA and C3a were similar in the two groups. The investigation has enabled a broad perspective of biocompatibility in CPB relevant to the clinical application of biomaterials.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,WOLFSON CTR,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT CARDIAC SURG,GLASGOW,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT MED,GLASGOW G31 2ER,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,26,17,17,0,3,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The animals were sacrificed at 1, 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Undecalcified histologic sections were prepared, evaluated qualitatively, and quantified with the aid of an image analysis system. The percentage of bone contact was determined morphometrically for all PEO/PBT proportions; for the 70/30 ratio, the percentage of calcification of the material surface and of bone-bonding (defined as a continuum at the light microscopic level between calcification within the material surface and bone tissue) were also assessed. PEO/PBT copolymers possess hydrogelic properties, and a direct relation has been established between water-uptake and PEO content. The swelling behavior of all PEO/PBT substrates resulted in a high degree of bone contact (over 95%) at early stages. From the 12-week survival time onward the 70/30 revealed higher percentages of bone contact (over 80%) when compared with the other ratios (60/40, 55/45, 40/60, and 30/70). This difference was statistically confirmed 1 year postoperatively. The materials with the higher PEO contents showed the highest amounts of calcification, which is reflected by the rate of bone-bonding (70% of bone-bonding for the 70/30 at 52 weeks). Calcification and bone-bonding were not observed for 40/60 and 30/70 proportions. The quantitative results confirmed the relation between PEO content, water-uptake, calcification, and bone-bonding. It was furthermore demonstrated that PEO/PBT copolymers initially establish a high degree of bone contact, whereas the bone-bonding properties, especially of the 70/30, accomplish a long-term implant fixation.

Recently, we described an efficient cross-linking process via the formation of acyl azide groups on methylated carboxyl groups of collagen using hydrazine and nitrous acid (referred to here as the hydrazine method). In this report, we propose a simpler, faster way to prepare acyl azide groups and to cross-link collagen-based biomaterials, using diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) as a reagent. After determining the optimal conditions of cross-linking with DPPA, we compared the efficiency of this protocol with that using hydrazine and with the classical glutaraldehyde treatment. In order to validate and quantitate the extent of reaction, the degree of crosslinking was determined by the measure of the free primary amino group content of the samples. Treatment of native bovine pericardium with 0.5% DPPA for 24h led to efficient cross-linking, corresponding to a 50% decrease in the free primary amino group content of the sample and raising its thermal stability from 62.8 up to 81.3 degrees C. In comparison, the thermal stabilities of glutaraldehyde or hydrazine-treated pericardium were 85 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 83.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Similar decreases in free primary amino group content and increases in thermal stability were obtained for collagen films treated with DPPA, glutaraldehyde, or hydrazine. These results were corroborated by resistance to bacterial collagenase digestion: DPPA-treated pericardium had a resistance to collagenase digestion similar to that of glutaraldehyde- or hydrazine-treated pericardium. Residual DPPA content was measured by determining the phosphorus content: the concentration of phosphorus in tissue treated with 0.5% DPPA was not significantly different from that of untreated tissue. Treatment by DPPA thus appears to be an efficient, rapid method for cross-linking collagen-based biomaterials.

In an attempt to optimize the fixation process, experiments were carried out with two types of collagen (native collagen membrane and synthetic collagen sheet) to study the effect on crosslinking of temperature, GA concentration and fixation time. Secondly, stimulation of GA diffusion was studied and finally, a procedure of low T-presoaking followed by brief exposure to high temperatures was investigated. As a measure of the degree of crosslinking the shrinkage temperature (T(s)) was determined. Temperature (20-degrees-C or 45-degrees-C), concentration (0.1% or 1.0%) or fixation time (4 or 24 h) were found to be positively correlated with the T(s) of the collagen sheets. Whereas untanned collagen exhibits a T(s), of around 60-degrees-C, short-term (1 or 5 min), high-temperature (50-degrees-C) fixation with a 0.1% GA solution caused the shrinkage temperature to increase to 72-degrees-C and 85.1-degrees-C, respectively. Fixation with 0.01% GA for 5 min at 50-degrees-C appeared equally effective as 1 min with 0.1% GA (T(s) = 70-degrees-C). Microwave irradiation showed to be slightly more effective in enhancing the crosslinking process compared with conventional heating. Surprisingly, at any combination of temperature, concentration and fixation periods of 4 h or 24 h, an increased T(s) towards the central regions of the collagen was observed. Soaking the samples at 20-degrees-C (1 h) or at 0-degrees-C (3 h) with subsequent short-time heating to 45-degrees-C caused an almost equal rise in T(s) throughout the collagen samples and is therefore recommended for preparing implantable tissues.","LEIDEN CYTOL & PATHOL LAB,2312 SP LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS","RUIJGROK, JM (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV,DEPT BIOMAT,BLD 55,RIJNSBURGERWEG 10,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,19,36,36,0,9,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The contact structure and the reaction of the contact associated contractile cytoskeleton were studied using fibres of different flexibility/mobility: butyl-S-Sepharose (S), Polysulfone (PS) and Polyurethane (PU). Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical investigations were carried out to obtain information on the influence of tension on (1) the structure of the focal contacts; (2) the constricting cytoskeleton known to retract adherent collagen or fibrin fibres and (3) the cable-like bundles of actomyosin as observed in the clot. Fibre network from S spheres and 0.3 mm thick frozen sections of PS or PU were incubated with citrated PRP or with washed platelets at 37 degrees C for 6 to 30 min while stirring for contact or activation with ADP or thrombin. Flexible fibres of the BM were found in deep invaginations of the plasmalemma associated with the constricting cytoskeleton. Focal contacts (mediated by fibrinogen as shown immunocytochemically) with fibres which were fixed in the texture or inflexible (PU) induce cable-like bundles of micofilaments containing myosin. These bundles pass across the cytoplasm and connect the contacts with the fibres or with Other platelets, as demonstrated by computer-assisted 3-dimensional reconstruction. The model used indicates that retraction is possible as long as fibres are mobile and that cable-like bundles occur when the locomotion of platelets is blocked by immobile fibres. The interaction of platelets with textured BM reflects the situation during collagen or fibrin condensation. The findings may contribute to an understanding of platelet reactions on textured surfaces in grafts.",,"MORGENSTERN, E (reprint author), UNIV SAARLAND, W-6650 HOMBURG, GERMANY.",,,,,,,43,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0953-7104,1369-1635,,PLATELETS,Platelets,FEB,1994.0,5,1,,,,,29,39,,10.3109/09537109409006038,,,,11,Cell Biology; Hematology,Cell Biology; Hematology,MW092,WOS:A1994MW09200005,21043741.0,,,,2019-02-25

The process can be initiated by intraluminal contamination and colonization of the peritoneal cavity as well as by bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, including catheters and exit site dressings. The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which two pathogenic organisms could adhere to three biomaterial surfaces, and the extent to which dextrose concentration influenced the binding and survival. Using a 24-hour in vitro assay, it was found that the Staphylococcus aureus strain consistently adhered significantly better than the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate, and only the adhesion of the latter was decreased with higher concentrations of dextrose in dialysis solutions. Electron microscopy demonstrates that within this short time period, bacterial biofilms had begun to form on the catheter surfaces.","UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT UROL SURG,LONDON,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT UROL SURG,TORONTO M5S 1A1,ON,CANADA; MONTANA STATE UNIV,CTR BIOFILM ENGN,BOZEMAN,MT 59717","REID, G (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT MICROBIOL & IMMUNOL,SLB 328,LONDON N6A 5B8,ON,CANADA.",,,,,,,20,16,16,0,1,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0250-8095,,,AM J NEPHROL,Am.

A mathematical model expressing the removal rate as a function of pertinent parameters was developed. The parameters included superficial air velocity, bubble size, bubble rising velocity, surfactant diffusion coefficient, and concentration. The model indicated that surfactant removal can be described as a first-order process whose rate increases with the diffusion coefficient, the superficial air velocity and the surfactant concentration in the bulk solution, but decreases with bubble size and bubble rising velocity. Based on the assumption of a completely mixed reactor within a section of a foam fractionator, a simplified model for foam fractionation under batch operation conditions was also presented. This simplified model provides a theoretical basis according to which the diffusion coefficient of surfactants can be determined and the model itself can be verified with experimental data.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT AGR & BIOL ENGN,ITHACA,NY 14853; CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN,ITHACA,NY 14853","CHEN, SL (reprint author), LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803, USA.",,,,,,,33,15,15,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0144-8609,,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

In the present study, we have used morphological techniques to examine the tissue response to titanium implants, and (immuno)cytochemistry to identify and characterize the organic moieties present at the bone-implant interface. Miniature titanium screws were implanted into rat tibiae. Animals were sacrificed at 1 day to 5 months post-implantation and tissues were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy, lectin-gold cytochemistry for glycoconjugates, and protein A-gold immunolabeling for non-collagenous bone and plasma proteins. Other rats were injected with H-3-proline, 4 days prior to sacrifice, to examine bone matrix deposition. New bone formation was observed soon after implantation, first as cancellous bone, which then remodeled relatively quickly into more compact bone. Radioautography confirmed bone matrix deposition in the vicinity of the implant. The presence of osteoblasts, osteoid or mineralized matrix against the implant surface indicates that bone deposition can occur both toward, and at the surface of, and then away from, the implant. Tissue components at the bone-implant interface included cells, cell debris and/or organic material with a variable appearance and thickness. A portion of the implant surface was covered with a layer (cement line/lamina limitans) rich in glycoconjugates that was intensely immunolabeled for osteopontin and alpha(2)HS-glycoprotein. Osteocalcin, fibronectin and albumin showed no preferential accumulation at the bone-implant interface. In conclusion, based on structural and compositional similarities between cement lines in bone and the bone-titanium interface, the host response to biomaterials may be similar to those osteogenic processes occurring at natural bone interfaces.","MCGILL UNIV,FAC DENT,MONTREAL H3A 2B2,PQ,CANADA; MCGILL UNIV,DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL,MONTREAL H3A 2B2,PQ,CANADA","NANCI, A (reprint author), UNIV MONTREAL,FAC DENT,CP 6128 CTR VILLE,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,PQ,CANADA.",,,,,,,60,64,65,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,1,,,,,1,30,,,,,,30,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PG257,WOS:A1994PG25700001,,,,,2019-02-25

For reasons of automation, to facilitate standardization and aid reproducibility, more objective evaluation of cytotoxic effects by quantitative methods would be preferable. In this study, three quantitative methods for cytotoxicity testing were compared with a reference method based on the examination of cell morphology. The influence of extracts of negative and positive control materials on HeLa cells was evaluated using quantitative parameters: number of cells (protein determination), viability (MTT-test), and DNA synthesis (incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine). The tests were performed according to the British Standard BS 5736 Part 10. Results were compared with those of morphological observations (reference method). Protein determination and MTT-test showed reproducible results and a good relationship with the results obtained by examining the morphology of cells. Although incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was the most sensitive test, it did not give sufficiently reproducible results as specified in BS 5736, Part 10. The main advantage of the presented tests is that they all can be performed in microtiter plates using optical density as parameter, which means that the assays can easily be automated.","UNIV MAINZ KLINIKUM, INST PATHOL, MAINZ, GERMANY","DEKKER, A (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN KLINIKUM, INST PATHOL, D-52057 AACHEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,16,37,41,0,6,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,101,112,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000001,,,,,2019-02-25

The aim of this work was to extend an organ culture method previously developed on vascular endothelium to trabecular bone. Trabecular bone cells from chick embryos and humans were comparatively grown on a control material (Thermanox(R)) and on a stainless steel 316L substrate. Two different cell types were observed around human bone explants: adherent fusiform osteoblastic cells, and non-adherent round bone marrow cells. All adherent cells were positive for alkaline phosphatase. Human cells synthesized type I collagen, osteopontin and fibronectin. Type III collagen, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein could not be detected in human cells by immunocytochemistry. Chick embryo cells synthesized type I and type III collagen and fibronectin. Type II collagen could not be detected in any species. Human cell layers were more extended and exhibited a greater number of cells than chick embryo layers. The growth parameters of chick embryo cultures displayed higher variations than human cultures. A preliminary comparison of cell growth on Thermanox(R) and on a stainless steel 316L substrate showed that human and chick embryo osteoblastic cells had similar behaviour on both materials. In conclusion, this organotypic culture method could be applied to both human and chick embryo trabecular bone. It allowed the growth of cells having the phenotype of immature osteoblasts. The culture method needs further improvement for cytocompatibility analysis.","UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELL EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE; HOP LARIBOISIERE,INSERM,U349,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","ANSELME, K (reprint author), INST CALOT,INST RECH MALAD SQUELETTE,RUE DR CALOT,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE.",,,"Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,27,12,12,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,113,123,,,,,,11,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000002,,,,,2019-02-25

To allow investigation of the interfacial area between the cells and the metallic substrates, these materials were removed by an electrodissolution process. With such samples, a remaining titanium oxide layer was observed in close apposition with the bottom of the cell sheet. This layer was discontinuous, variable in thickness, and contained large amounts of carbon but no calcium. Contamination of the cell layer by titanium, due to the electrochemical process, was detected by electron energy loss spectrometry. The presence of mineralized matrix was demonstrated in the nodules formed by the cells on every type of specimen, but was never found in direct contact with the substrates. The thin layer of extracellular material ensuring the linkage with the substrates was not mineralized. Matrix-mediated contacts were composed of patches of collagenous material or fibrillar non-organized material. Fibronectin was detected on the substrates by fluorescence microscopy after mechanical detachment of the cell layer. The absence of a mineralized interface appears to be related to the surface properties of the substrates, but also to the cell origin. This might reflect the in vivo case of osteointegration failure, when the tissue is composed of a layer of non-mineralized connective tissue in contact with smooth materials.","ECOLE CENT LYON,TECHNOL SURFACES LAB,CNRS,URA 855,F-69130 ECULLY,FRANCE; ECOLE CENT LYON,MAT MECAN PHYS LAB,CNRS,URA 447,F-69130 ECULLY,FRANCE","BOUVIER, M (reprint author), FAC ODONTOL LYON,DEV & PATHOL TISSUS DENT LAB,CNRS,UPR 412,RUE GUILLAUME PARADIN,F-69372 LYON 8,FRANCE.",,,,,,,43,11,11,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,135,142,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000004,,,,,2019-02-25

In this review, we have summarized the results of our studies aimed at understanding the regulation of endosteal bone formation and osteoblasts. We have developed histological studies on the effects of minerals and systemic factors on endosteal osteoblasts using the model of the rodent caudal vertebrae. The cellular responsiveness to hormones and growth factors was also studied in vitro using endosteal osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse caudal vertebrae. in vivo studies showed that the osteoblastic function is directly affected by phosphate, magnesium, and strontium, which may have important implications on the interactions between biomaterials and bone cells. Systemic agents were shown to have direct effects on endosteal bone formation and osteoblast function, and indirect effects through changes in bone resorption. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that hormones (vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, testosterone, estrogens) and growth factors (epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth factor P) regulate directly and indirectly the proliferation and differentiation of endosteal osteoblastic cells, and play a major role in the induction of vertebral bone formation. Further studies on the osteoblast biology in the endosteum are required to improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the formation of new bone at the interface between osteoblasts and biomaterials.",,"MARIE, PJ (reprint author), HOP LARIBOISIERE, INSERM, U349, 6 RUE GUY PATIN, F-75010 PARIS, FRANCE.",,,,,,,99,9,10,0,2,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,143,154,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000005,,,,,2019-02-25

Specifically in cardiopulmonary bypass, blood is exposed to a large material surface area, which induces an inflammatory reaction and bleeding disorders. It has been attempted to counteract these adverse effects of extracorporeal circulation by employing biocompatible materials, by pharmacological treatment of the patients, and by surface coating of the blood-contacting area. On reviewing the research field related to blood activation by cardiopulmonary bypass, it is concluded that the whole surgical procedure has to be taken into account.

This paper critically reviews recent data in this area and discusses the mechanisms involved in the reactionary and reparative processes and during the induction of odontoblast differentiation in vitro. When trying to compare primary and reparative dentinogenesis, two parameters, independently of the molecular basis of the induction, appeared to be of major importance: they concern the regulation in time and space of both the induction and the competence of the target cells.","DENT SCH BIRMINGHAM, DEPT ORAL PATHOL, BIRMINGHAM, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND; DENT SCH, DEPT DENT PATHOL & THERAPEUT, GR-54006 THESSALONIKI, GREECE","LESOT, H (reprint author), FAC MED STRASBOURG, MED BIOL INST, 11 RUE HUMANN, F-67085 STRASBOURG, FRANCE.",,,,,,,112,66,68,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,3,,,,,199,218,,,,,,20,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QF980,WOS:A1994QF98000001,,,,,2019-02-25

Since slight differences in purity, chemical composition and crystal structure of calcium phosphates can have significant effects on cell behaviour, the calcium phosphate component of the foils was analysed by X-ray diffraction. Some aspects of cellular activity in relation to the zeta potential and interfacial tension of the different surfaces were determined. Primary bovine osteoblasts were grown on the surfaces and growth and differentiation were examined. The results show that the late of cell attachment was faster on surfaces with lower surface tension. The highest indicator for differentiation was found on the biocomposite with the lowest zeta potential. Scanning electron microscope investigations showed good attachment and growth of osteoblast-like cells on all materials. It is concluded that different material properties have distinct influences on cell reactions, the zeta potential being more important than interfacial tension for differentiation.","UNIV MUNSTER,CELL BIOL LAB,D-48129 MUNSTER,GERMANY; GESELL GESUNDHEIT & UMWELTFORSCH MBH,D-65933 FRANKFURT,GERMANY; UNIV WURZBURG,DEPT EXPTL DENT,D-97070 WURZBURG,GERMANY",,,,,,,,41,12,12,1,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,3,,,,,263,274,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QF980,WOS:A1994QF98000005,,,,,2019-02-25

The goal of the study was to provide a quantification technique for standardization of the coating process. The samples were placed in a dynamic active vision system to measure three-dimensional coordinates on the surface. Surface fractal dimension was assessed over a range of scales, using the variation method. The results show that fractal dimension is a valuable parameter for the determination of surface roughness and for the study of bioadhesion.","UNIV MONTREAL,FAC PHARM,MONTREAL,PQ H3C 3J7,CANADA",,,,"Dubuc, Benoit/0000-0002-9481-3154",,,,28,4,4,0,2,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,4,,,,,379,386,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QP351,WOS:A1994QP35100007,,,,,2019-02-25

Material coated with albumin may be ''passivated'' and unlikely to trigger either thrombogenic or inflammatory responses whereas implants preincubated with plasma may attract large number of phagocytes. In an effort to understand the basis of inflammatory responses to biomaterials, we have employed implants made of polyester terephthalate. This review briefly summarizes our recent progress in determining the importance of adsorbed proteins in the attraction of phagocytic cells to device surfaces. Our initial hypothesis was that spontaneous adsorption of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was critical in later inflammatory reactions. Although samples of Mylar film, preincubated with purified IgG and implanted in mice did, as expected, prompt the accumulation of large numbers of phagocytes shortly after implantation, so also did uncoated material implanted in severely hypogammaglobulinemic mice (with severe combined immune-deficiency), implying that surface adsorption of IgG was not a necessary precedent to phagocyte responses. However, we subsequently observed that material preincubated with plasma promoted phagocyte recruitment whereas implants pre-coated with serum did not. The critical plasma component is evidently fibrinogen; not only does fibrinogen coated material attract phagocytes but uncoated material implanted in hypofibrinogen-emic mice fails to elicit an inflammatory response (unless pre-coated with fibrinogen). This pro-inflammatory effect of adsorbed fibrinogen suggests an interesting connection between two of the major iatrogenic effects of implanted and blood contact biomaterials: thrombosis and inflammation.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,ALBANY,NY 12208",,,,,,,,44,33,33,1,8,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,4,,,,,429,436,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QP351,WOS:A1994QP35100012,,,,,2019-02-25

Three important questions that pertain to surgical implants are (1) What are the mechanisms that cause abnormal inflammatory responses in the absence of infection and result in interface cellular disorganization and device failure? (2) What causes host defenses to be compromised to the extent that normal flora organisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis, with little or no virulence potential, can cause life-threatening infections at the implant-host interface? (3) What is the nature of surface regions of biomaterials that facilitate bacterial adherence? Pathogenic strains of S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus have an affinity for biomaterial surfaces and are capable of initiating infection. Binding may be nonspecific and gluelike rather than a receptor-ligand event as for S. aureus and matrix proteins. This study indicates bacterial binding to sites of higher vanadium concentration at grain boundaries and mixed phases in titanium alloys. Repeated macrophage priming by biomaterial particulates results in the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, macrophage exhaustion, and adjacent tissue damage. A cytokine cascade is also initiated. A self-perpetuating enlarging immune-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone develops about implants, which features tissue cell damage, increased susceptibility to infection, and results in septic or aseptic failure of the implant. These effects are clearly exemplified by fibrosis about breast implants and osteolysis at the interface of total joint replacements.",,"GRISTINA, AG (reprint author), MED SCI RES INST,HERNDON,VA 22071, USA.",,,,NIADDK NIH HHS [AM 26957]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM 35939],,,35,166,169,0,12,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

The electrochemical behavior of these biomaterials is of interest for a variety of reasons. The corrosion resistance of an implant material influences its functional performance and durability and is a primary factor governing biocompatibility. Among the aspects affecting biocompatibility are the amounts and farms of released corrosion products and their disposition in the body after release. Electrochemical principles are very useful for understanding the factors affecting corrosion resistance and also form the foundation for many biosensors that measure the concentration of various chemical entities (including released corrosion products and naturally occurring substances). Many electrochemical measurement techniques have been used to study biomaterials for years (e.g., polarization curve measurement), while others (such as polarography and AC impedance methods) have been applied more recently. This work focuses on four main topics. The first is the nature of the body's environment as it affects in vivo electrochemical phenomena, that is, the chemical, mechanical, biological, and bioelectrical phenomena that affect the behavior and performance of biomaterials. The second deals with methodology - the techniques used for corrosion measurement and concentration determination, the appropriate environment (laboratory, cell culture, in vivo, etc.), and experimental problems encountered. The third topic treated is the knowledge accumulated regarding the performance of implant alloys in various applications, for example, the forms of corrosion to which they are susceptible, etc. Finally, improvements that may come about in the future regarding both materials and testing methodology are considered.",,"BUNDY, KJ (reprint author), TULANE UNIV, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70118 USA.",,,,,,,1672,83,83,0,26,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",0278-940X,1943-619X,,CRIT REV BIOMED ENG,Crit.

In the design and development of formulations to achieve this goal, the formulation scientist must consider the clinical indication, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and physicochemical stability of the drug. The development of a stable formulation is a necessary step for each new protein or peptide therapeutic. The degradation pathways and their impact on stability should be systematically analyzed and competing degradation rates must be balanced to arrive at the most stable formulation possible. Several routes of administration should also be considered and future development of new formulations may expand the number of potential options. Formulations for each route of administration may be unique and, therefore, have special requirements. In the case of depot formulations, there are many potential matrices, each of which has distinct characteristics that affect its interactions with the drug and its behavior in vivo. The formulation characteristics may have a dramatic impact on the in vivo stability of the drug as well as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The optimization of formulations, the routes of delivery, the design of depot systems, and the correlation between physicochemical stability and in vivo behavior are discussed in detail with recent examples. For new biotechnology-derived drugs including nucleic acids (DNA vectors and antisense RNA) to reach commercialization, all of the issues involved in the design and development of a drug formulation must be considered at an early stage of the overall development process.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","CLELAND, JL (reprint author), GENENTECH INC, S SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94080 USA.",,"Sanguansri, Luz/B-6630-2011","Sanguansri, Luz/0000-0003-1908-7604",,,,103,26,26,1,1,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,,0-8412-2959-7,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

The preservation of proteins during freezing and drying is fundamentally different for each process. Protection of labile proteins during freezing appears to be due to the same thermodynamic mechanism that accounts for solute-induced stabilization in nonfrozen aqueous solution. Namely, preferential exclusion of the solute leads to stabilization of the native state of the protein. Protection of proteins during drying by sugars is due to the sugar hydrogen bonding to the dried protein and serving as a water replacement. Recovery of enzyme activity after freeze-drying and rehydration correlates directly with the maintenance of the native protein structure in the dried state. Sugars protect labile proteins by inhibiting lyophilization-induced unfolding. Finally, certain polymers (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone). protect freeze-dried multimeric enzymes during freeze-drying and rehydration. These compounds cannot serve as ''water replacements'' in the dried state. Rather they inhibit the freezing- and drying-induced dissociation. The fully polymerized oligomers are more resistant to these stresses.","AMGEN INC,AMGEN CTR,THOUSAND OAKS,CA 91320","CARPENTER, JF (reprint author), UNIV COLORADO,HLTH SCI CTR,SCH MED,DENVER,CO 80262, USA.",,,,,,,33,51,51,0,11,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0097-6156,,0-8412-2959-7,ACS SYM SER,,,1994.0,567,,,,,,134,147,,,,,,14,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,BB32M,WOS:A1994BB32M00009,,,,,2019-02-25

In this perspective, the consideration of biological membranes at a molecular level requires detailed knowledge of the preferred conformations of the triglycerides in their various polymorphic forms. In this context, we adapted a molecular modeling approach, which allows the simulation the three-dimensional structure of the different polymorphic forms (alpha, beta', and beta) valid for any triglyceride. Their conformational analysis is based on molecular mechanics calculations, as follows: First, a large number of isolated molecular structures were generated in asystematic structure-tree analysis. For their generation, atomic charges within the Mulliken scheme, calculated at the ab initio RHF-LCAO-MO-SCF level (6-31G), were considered. The lowest-energy conformers were, next, correlated with experimental data (NMR, powder X-ray diffraction) in order to select alpha, beta', or beta structures. Then, in a second step, these selected conformers were assembled, in head-to-tail dimers in order to form a monolayer. For this step, the use of potential-derived atomic charges is known to be more suitable. In this study, we consider triglycerides derived from the predominant fatty acids, i.e., stearic, elaidic, and oleic acids.

The D-H-D polymer product was characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13-NMR). D-H-D was physisorbed on polyethylene (PE) from aqueous solution, and the adhesion stability and resistance to protein adsorption was examined under static and dynamic flow conditions, using a modified rotating disk system. Modified surfaces were characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and by water contact angles. Under applied shear stresses of up to 73 dyn cm(-2), the adhesion of D-H-D on PE was sufficient to inhibit desorption by water (>90% D-H-D on PE was retained) and 5% SDS surfactant solution (approximately 83% D-H-D retained), as determined by ATR-FTIR. Under similar shear stress conditions, albumin adsorption on D-H-D modified PE was reduced by over 90%, and protein adsorption from fresh human plasma was reduced by approximately 70% compared with unmodified PE. The results are discussed in terms of interfacial forces, and the suitability of this approach for studying protein-surface interactions and for developing a novel class of protein-resistant biomaterials.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106","MARCHANT, RE (reprint author), CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-40047],,,50,42,44,1,16,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The adhesion of HPL was shown to be dependent not only on the wettability but also on the protein preadsorbed. Vitronectin expressed not only a higher extent of adhesion under static conditions but also a stronger interaction with HPL, indicated by the low detachment under shear stress. The flow experiments also demonstrated that FN adsorbed on octadecyl glass may undergo conformational changes because HPL could be easily removed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that HPL on both FN-and VN-coated glass spread well whereas particularly on FN-coated octadecyl glass less cell spreading was observed; moreover, some round cells were detected. The typing of adherent HPL by immunofluorescence microscopy showed that on FN- and VN-coated glass about 70% of all HPL were T-cells (CD 3+). However, on octadecyl glass, particularly on VN, a smaller percentage of CD 3+cell was observed. The testing for the beta(1) integrin-the receptor for FN and the alpha(v) integrin-the receptor for VN demonstrated that about 70% of all cells on FN-coated glass were positive for the beta(1) integrin. On VN-coated glass, however, only 5% of HPL were positive for the beta(1) integrin. Although on VN a high adhesion and strong binding of HPL was observed, no presence of the alpha(v)integrin was detected.","BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,CENT LAB BIOPHYS,BU-1113 SOFIA,BULGARIA","GROTH, T (reprint author), HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH MED,BIOMAT RES UNIT,TUCHHOLSKYSTR 2,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,37,24,24,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Isolated human blood neutrophils were allowed to interact with the polymer surface and the chemiluminescence response of the cells was recorded as a measure of oxidative activation. The polymers represented surfaces that differed markedly with respect to charge, hardness, and wettability. We found that all polymers stimulated the chemiluminescence response in neutrophils differently; when preincubation with human serum albumin (HSA) there was a general reduction of the chemiluminescence response particularly on one of the positively charged surface 1, 2-diamino-cyclohexane (DACH). Addition of a soluble stimulus, the chemoattractant formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP), to the cells caused a dramatic increase in the response on one of the hydrophobic surface hexamethylene-isiloxane (HMDSO). However, there was also a pronounced reduction in the response on polymers with acrylic acid (AA). The response was normalized after addition of HSA. Taken together, the chemiluminescene response of the neutrophils interacting with the polymer surfaces differed with regard to the type of surfaces. When HSA and FMLP were added a larger difference in the response was found. Our results showed that the activation of human neutrophil granulocytes influenced by different polymer surfaces, followed unspecific different patterns which were someway related to the specific characteristics of the polymer and from this point we came to similar conclusions made by Kaplan et al. (J. Biomater. Res. 28, 377 (1994)), that it is difficult to extrapolate any activation mechanisms from one material to another. The reproducibility of the reaction patterns, the importance of neutrophil activation, and the relative simplicity of the method indicates, however, that the mechanisms of neutrophil activation at biomaterial surface is well worth further research.","LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL IMMUNOL & INFECT DIS,LINKOPING,SWEDEN; INST SURFACE CHEM,S-11486 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","NIMERI, G (reprint author), LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT PHYS & MEASUREMENT TECHNOL,APPL PHYS LAB,INTERFACE BIOL GRP,S-58183 LINKOPING,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,28,4,4,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

On the one hand, leukocyte affinity tau(s)(leu) (number of deposited leukocytes mm-2 s-1) was not significantly different between IUPAC.PVC (tau(s)(leu) = 1.2-2.5) and PRM.PDMS (tau(s)(leu) = 1.5-3.4) and the fibrinogen adsorption rate varied from 33 to 48.10(-5) mug mm-2 s-1 for both these materials. On the other hand, platelet affinity tau(s)(plat) (number of deposited platelets mm-2 s-1) was significantly different (p < 0.05) for IUPAC.PVC and PRM.PDMS (tau(s)(plat)PVC = 683 +/- 200 > tau(s)(plat)PDMS = 327 +/- 80). Scanning electron micrographs of adherent platelets, red cells and leukocytes after blood contact ex vivo were performed after each experiment.

The diphenols were a homologous series of three desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters (ethyl, hexyl, octyl) which had previously been used in the synthesis of mechanically strong and tissue-compatible polycarbonates. The diacids (succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid) were selected among compounds that were known to be of low systemic toxicity. By using different diacids as comonomers, the flexibility of the polymer backbone could be varied while the desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters provided pendent chains of various length. Some of the thermal and mechanical properties of the five polymers could be correlated to their chemical structure: the glass transition temperature decreased from 53 to 13 degrees C, and the tensile modulus (measured at room temperature) decreased from 1500 to about 3 MPa when the length of the aliphatic diacid in the polymer backbone and/or the length of the alkyl ester pendent chain was increased. The presence of an arylate bond in the polymer backbone introduced a hydrolytically labile linkage into the polymer structure. Under physiological conditions in vitro all polymers degraded: thin films retained only about 30-40% of their initial molecular weight (M(w)) after 26 weeks of storage in phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Release studies with p-nitroaniline as a model drug indicated that a diffusion controlled release process occurred. The rate of p-nitroaniline release could be correlated with the glass transition temperature of the polymer.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ",,,,,,,,29,49,49,0,7,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Infrared spectra showed the presence of amide groups, including those cases where the volatile compound ('monomer') did not contain oxygen. The performance of the surfaces in cell attachment correlated with the surface hydrophilicity and the nitrogen content, although for the latter a fair degree of scatter indicated that a more complex relationship applies. All these surfaces supported the attachment and growth of human cells. Generally, amide plasma polymers were best but the individual monomer and the plasma parameters also played a role. From comparisons of the various surfaces, it is suggested that the amide group is the main promoter of cell attachment in nitrogen-containing plasma surfaces.","CSIRO, DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN, N RYDE, NSW 2113, AUSTRALIA","GRIESSER, HJ (reprint author), CSIRO, DIV CHEM & POLYMERS, PRIVATE BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA.",,"Griesser, Hans/E-5628-2011","Griesser, Hans/0000-0003-1072-7863",NCRR NIH HHS [RRO1296],,,61,158,160,1,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Platelets were labeled with In-111-oxine. The least thrombogenic material was Avcothane 51 elastomere. The only effective treatment for reduction of platelet deposition on the six materials was 5 mg/kg BW/day of acetylsalicylic acid. The dose used in group 3 only decreased the deposition of platelets on three of the six materials studied.

This finding directly supports the hypothesis that hydrated silica plays an important role in biologically active hydroxyapatite formation on the surfaces of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics, which leads to bone-bonding. Gel-derived titania is also a hydroxyapatite inducer because of its abundant TiOH groups. These results provide further insight into the unique osseointegration of titanium and its alloys. It is suspected that gel-derived titania develops an apatite layer by taking calcium and phosphate from the body fluid, thus producing bone-bonding. Although sufficient A1OH groups may remain in the alumina gel, they do not serve to initiate apatite generation when immersed in SBF. This phenomenon explains the fact that an intermediate fibrous tissue is usually found to separate the alumina implant from bone. One may infer that both abundant OH groups and negatively charged surfaces of gel-derived silica and titania are important for hydroxyapatite induction. Material which possesses and/or develops both a negatively charged surface and abundant OH groups in a physiologically-related fluid is most likely to be an efficient apatite inducer. Such materials are suitable candidates to serve as bone-bonding biomaterials.

In this study, two methods of in vitro enzyme degradation and a method for the separation of the degradative products by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) are reported. In the first method two dental adhesives, Scotchbond and Scotchbond II, and two dental composites, Heliomolar and P-50, were evaluated. These materials were incubated with four different enzymatic preparations for periods of up to 72 h. The enzymes were Lipase, esterase, and Liver enzyme extracts from both mouse and rat. Chloroform soluble products extracted from the aqueous phase were examined by HPTLC for decomposition products resulting from enzyme activity. The second method was similar, but analyzed the aqueous fraction directly without chloroform extraction. In this method five dental restorative materials, P-50, P-30, Scotchbond II, Silux, and Silux plus, were incubated with a nonspecific porcine liver esterase. In addition to the polymerized biomaterials, monomers containing methacrylic acid units were also hydrolyzed with esterase and analyzed by ion chromatography to establish the sensitivity of the enzyme simulator. Each biomaterial presented thin-layer zones not present before enzymatic action. These experiments provide support that aqueous enzymatic action may facilitate the hydrolytic weakening of polymeric biomaterials.

Present-day biomaterials being biocompatible when in bulk form, a host reaction consequent upon untoward effects of the implants as such is not expected. Thus, osseointegration, i.e., the direct apposition of bone to the surface of a foreign material at the light microscopical level, occurs, under favorable biomechanical circumstances, irrespective of the chemical composition of the implant. Osseointegration is a multifaceted phenomenon. First and foremost, it evolves when an initially rigid fixation of the component is surgically attained. Interfacial motions are associated with resorption of the bony bed, macrophagic activation and production of wear particles, the close bone-implant apposition is lost and the formation of an interfacial membrane (IM) ensues. The histological features of the IM coincide with the context of its formation and evolution. The quiescent IM is composed of a thin layer of fibrous tissue and its occurrence is compatible with the biofunctionality of the implant. The aggressive or lytic IM (LIM) develops when tissue-irritating, small, irregularly shaped and edgy breakdown products are deposited at the interface. The thick LIM consists of an inflamed fibrous tissue, scattered within which are myriad granulomas, and its surface facing the implant displays a synovial-like aspect. The mono-and polykaryonic macrophages, constituting the granulomatous response, ingest and abut on the wear particles. Amongst the intermediary substances of inflammation elaborated by the lymphocytes and macrophages of the LIM, factors which stimulate the osteoclasts play the pivotal role in as much as progressive bone resorption is associated with progressive growth of the IM and, hence, with incremental interfacial motion, interfacial deposition of wear particles and inflammatory-granulomatous response. The ensuing vicious circle culminates in aseptic loosening of the arthroplasty. The morphological features of the LIM, though characterized by a stereotypical reaction pattern, are, in their details, closely linked with the nature of the diverse components of the composite joint replacement. The histological appearances of the bone-implant interface of stable and loose arthroplasties, the tissular reactions to polymethylmethacrylate, polyethylene, polyacetal, metals and hydroxyapatite as well as the characteristics of cemented acid cementless porous-coated, press-fit and hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses are described.","BNAI ZION MED CTR, DEPT PATHOL, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL; BNAI ZION MED CTR, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL","BOSS, JH (reprint author), TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL, FAC MED, BRUCE RAPPAPORT INST RES MED SCI, CTR IMPLANT SURG, POB 4940, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL.",,,,,,,265,36,37,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

OPs initiate chondroblastic differentiation in pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, followed by the synthesis of new bone by endochondral ossification. OPs have the ability to induce healing of osteoperiosteal defects in several animal models, supporting a possible therapeutic role in the reconstruction of bone defects. OPs are responsible for the osteoinductive capacity of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) implants, which may also prove to be clinically useful. Preliminary studies using purified, naturally occurring human osteogenic proteins in the clinical management of non-unions have reported promising results. A prospective, randomized clinical trial is currently underway, comparing recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1) to autograft in the treatment of tibial non-unions.

A prospective study addressing these factors was therefore undertaken over an 11 month period. 51 patients presenting with significant capsular contracture, suspected prosthesis rupture or unrelieved implant-induced anxiety underwent revisional breast surgery after biochemical, haematological and immunological screening. Of these 51 patients (83 breasts), 14 (19 breasts) had ruptured implants (23% incidence). These were all smooth prostheses belonging to a cohort manufactured more than 10 years ago; their mean in situ duration being 12 years vs. 5.5 years for the intact group (p = 0.0024; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). There were no systemic complications from implant rupture and the mean blood silicon level was normal. One patient with pre-existing pernicious anaemia had elevated autoantibodies. The mean ESR in the ruptured implant group was 6 mm/hour. It is concluded that rupture of breast implants is not as uncommon as hitherto thought and is strongly correlated with their in situ duration. In this study implant gel leakage was not associated with serious systemic effects.","ST LUKES HOSP, DEPT RADIOL, BRADFORD BD7 1DP, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","MALATA, CM (reprint author), ST LUKES HOSP, DEPT PLAST SURG, BRADFORD BD7 1DP, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,69,29,29,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

First, genetic engineering techniques have been used in conjunction with silane-based self-assembly systems to construct close-packed protein monolayers on optical substrates. The resulting structures have been characterized with immunological and surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy techniques. Recombinant DNA techniques have also been used to study the role of electrostatic forces in protein-protein interactions and may be used to gain control over the assembly of multicomponent protein thin films. In addition to these assembly considerations, protein engineering techniques can be used for a second purpose: the manipulation of optical and ET properties of heme proteins. Control over the heme absorption transition energies, redox potentials, and redox center composition can be realized through a combination of genetic engineering and protein. chemistry techniques.

The surface of all currently available biomaterials stimulate, microscopically or macroscopically, the host biological system when in direct contact. As a result, complement activation, blood coagulation, thrombus formation, encapsulation, and calcification take place. It has been shown that surface modification by grafting techniques can markedly reduce such stimulation, thus improving the interfacial biocompatibility of currently used biomedical polymers.

We report here the design, synthesis, and characterization of recombinant protein polymers based on multimers of 15 amino acid consensus sequences approximating the more complex natural protein. Spontaneous fibrillar aggregate formation in the genetically engineered analogs has been confirmed by various methods and the propensity of such aggregates to phase separate into liquid crystalline arrays has been observed.

These phenomena often involve an increase in chemokinesis and cellular secretory activity, usually expressed in antimicrobial activity. Once activated, the cells can move quickly towards the source of the stimulus, where they produce and release great amounts of enzymes (e.g. proteases, hydrolases, lysozyme) and reactive oxygen metabolites (e.g. O2-., H2O2, OH.). This study has examined the ability of surfaces of selected biomaterials to influence neutrophil morphology and locomotion. The surface of two films derived from hyaluronic acid derivatives were compared with that of glass. The two hyaluronic acid derivatives, despite having a similar chemical structure, were shown to interact with human neutrophils in different ways. A hyaluronic acid ethyl ester stimulated the whole population of neutrophils to take up a non-spherical morphology (polarize) and to move with a velocity similar to that of N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine-stimulated cells on a glass surface. In contrast, only 44% of the examined cells on the surface of hyaluronic acid benzyl ester were polarized and their mean speed was only slightly higher with respect to that found with non-stimulated cells on glass. Moreover, while on the benzyl ester and on glass a correlation between neutrophil circularity (i.e. the shape of the cell) and cell speed was found, the ethyl ester did not show any correlation.","UNIV LIVERPOOL, DEPT CLIN ENGN, POB 147, LIVERPOOL L69 3BX, ENGLAND; FIDIA RES LABS, DIV ADV TECHNOL, I-35031 ABANO TERME, ITALY",,,"Campoccia, Davide/K-5348-2018; Hunt, John/G-6366-2012","Campoccia, Davide/0000-0002-3336-0219; Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778",,,,14,18,18,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,DEC,1993.0,14,15,,,,,1135,1139,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90156-V,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,MP264,WOS:A1993MP26400004,8130317.0,,,,2019-02-25

Cell membrane integrity can be determined by different tests depending upon the cell membrane permeability to various markers. To measure the degree of cell damage, we have chosen to compare the release of two markers in the supernatants: enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, which we wanted to compare to that of radioactive chromium preincorporated in cells, the latter being validated by a standard), from three cell types: cells from a fibroblastic cell line (3T3 Balb/c) and human differentiated endothelial cells and osteoblasts, exposed to injurious agents and to biomaterials of classical use. The labeling procedure as well as the incubation periods performed, were carried out according to a standard. Cell labeling efficiency ranged from 4 to 10%. The biomaterials tested provoked no or slight cell membrane damage. After linear regression analysis, we found high correlation coefficients between chromium release and LDH release. Thus, the determination of LDH activity, which is easy to manipulate, could be a satisfactory test to evaluate cell membrane integrity in contact with biomaterials and a prerequisite stage before the more sophisticated chromium-51 release test.

Characterization by contact angles, surface spectroscopy, and ellipsometry verified that these model surfaces could be repeatedly prepared with good consistency for routine use to study biomolecule adsorption onto model surfaces.

These structural differences imparted different amphiphilic characters that led to measurable differences in the adsorption of these peptides to liquid-vapor interfaces. The adsorption to model surfaces was studied using ESCA, radiometry, and concentration-dependent contact angles. ESCA and radiometry measured irreversible biomolecules adsorption whereas the contact angle method measured steady-state adsorption.

Therefore, predegraded poly(L-lactic acid) (P-PLLA) and nontreated PLLA (N-PLLA) particles, both having diameters not exceeding 38 mu m, were injected intraperitoneally in mice. P-PLLA particles were obtained by 25 kGy gamma-irradiation of N-PLLA particles. N-PLLA and P-PLLA particles were injected using an 0.3% ethanol/0.90% saline solution intraperitoneally to the mice. We also studied the release of the absorbed ethanol as a possible model for the release of low molecular weight, potentially toxic products. As control, nondegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles and the carrier solution were used. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 days, the cells of the abdominal cavity were harvested to study the effect of phagocytosis of polymer particles on phagocytic cell morphology and viability. Studies with transmission electron microscopy indicated that, upon injection of particles in the peritoneal cavity, macrophages demonstrated signs of cell damage, cell death, and cell lysis due to phagocytosis of a large amount of P-PLLA particles. The morphology of the cells that had phagocytosed the N-PLLA and PTFE particles did not differ substantially from those of control animals in which only the solution was injected. Also, in the controls, hardly any cell death and no debris was observed. When the PLLA particles were injected as a suspension in a 0.3% ethanol/0.90% saline solution, no difference was observed between N-PLLA and P-PLLA. After phagocytosis, both cause cell damage, sometimes leading to cell death. The highest numbers of necrotic cells were observed on day 2. The effects could be caused by the (peak) release of degradation products from P-PLLA fragments or by the release of the absorbed ethanol when the 0.3 ethanol/0.9 saline solution was used to administer the particles. In conclusion, it can be stated that cell damager sometimes leading to cell death, may be caused by phagocytosed poly(L-lactic acid) particles.

Early interactions between implants and inflammatory cells are probably mediated by a layer of host proteins on the material surface. To evaluate the importance of this protein layer, we studied acute inflammatory responses of mice to samples of polyester terephthalate film (PET) that were implanted intraperitoneally for short periods. Material preincubated with albumin is ''passivated,'' accumulating very few adherent neutrophils or macrophages, whereas uncoated or plasma-coated PET attracts large numbers of phagocytes. Neither IgG adsorption nor surface complement activation is necessary for this acute inflammation; phagocyte accumulation on uncoated implants is normal in hypogammaglobulinemic mice and in severely hypocomplementemic mice. Rather, spontaneous adsorption of fibrinogen appears to be critical: (a) PET coated with serum or hypofibrinogenemic plasma attracts as few phagocytes as does albumin-coated material; (b) in contrast, PET preincubated with serum or hypofibrinogenemic plasma containing physiologic amounts of fibrinogen elicits ''normal'' phagocyte recruitment; (c) most importantly, hypofibrinogenemic mice do not mount an inflammatory response to implanted PET unless the material is coated with fibrinogen or the animals are injected with fibrinogen before implantation. Thus, spontaneous adsorption of fibrinogen appears to initiate the acute inflammatory response to an implanted polymer, suggesting an interesting nexus between two major iatrogenic effects of biomaterials: clotting and inflammation.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EXPTL PATHOL, A81, 47 NEW SCOTLAND RD, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA",,,,,,,,87,331,333,1,37,ROCKEFELLER UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"950 THIRD AVE, 2ND FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10022 USA",0022-1007,1540-9538,,J EXP MED,J.

The individual polymorphs were prepared and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy, and physical appearance. The FTR spectra of the two polymorphs showed distinct differences which result from ''crystal splitting'' effects. A series of 13 different mixtures of polymorph A and B was prepared by geometric mixing and their FTR spectra statistically analysed by factor analysis programming. Predictions of the A/B polymorphic composition of mixtures were made and compared with the theoretical values. The results demonstrate that FTRS combined with factor analysis programming may be successfully applied to the in situ monitoring of the A/B polymorphic nature of a chlorpropamide sample.","COURTAULDS RES, COVENTRY CV6 5RS, ENGLAND; UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, DEPT CHEM, SOUTHAMPTON SO9 5NH, HANTS, ENGLAND; UNIV NOTTINGHAM, DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI, NOTTINGHAM NG7 2RD, ENGLAND",,,,"Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,15,45,45,0,10,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,1573-904X,,PHARM RES-DORDR,Pharm.

One approach involves the covalent attachment of photoisomerizable components such as azobenzene units or thiophenefulgide components. In one of the photoisomer states of the photoactive units, the tertiary structure of the proteins is retained and, consequently, their biological functionalities are switched ''ON''. In the complementary photoisomer state, the structure of the proteins is distorted and its activities are switched ''OFF''. The hydrolytic activities of papain have been photostimulated by covalent linkage of azobenzene units. While trans-azobenzene-modified papain reveals bioactivity towards hydrolysis of N-alpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-nitroanilide (7), cisazobenzene-modified papain is switched ''OFF'' towards the hydrolytic process. Similarly, association of the saccharide 4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (11) to thiophenefulgide-modified concanavalin A is photostimulated. The second approach for controlling the activities of biomaterials involves their immobilization in photoisomerizable polymers. In these systems photostimulated transport of the protein substrates across the polymer matrices triggered ''ON-OFF'' the functions of the encapsulated biomaterial. alpha-Chymotrypsin was immobilized in the series of photochromic copolymers consisting of acrylamide and 1-beta-(methacryloxy)ethyl-3,3'-dimethyl-6-nitrospiroindoline-2,2'-[2H-1]benzopyran(l2), bis(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-(4-vinylphenyl)methyl leucohydroxide (14) or 4-(methacryloylamino) azobenzene (15). The hydrolysis of N-(3 -carboxypropionyl) -L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide (13) by alpha-chymotrypsin is controlled by the permeability properties of 12 across the different photoisomer states of the respective polymers.","HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,FARKAS CTR LIGHT INDUCED PROC,IL-91904 JERUSALEM,ISRAEL","WILLNER, I (reprint author), HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,INST CHEM,IL-91904 JERUSALEM,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,13,23,24,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0923-1137,,,REACT POLYM,React.

Genetic engineering methods can be used to modify the chemical composition of the storage compounds in many plant species. This will create opportunities to expand the uses of biomaterials as renewable and environmentally more benign alternatives to some uses of petrochemicals. Many of the most promising opportunities, in this respect, involve relatively minor modifications of the chemical composition of plant oils. The introduction of a single functional group into a fatty acid may create new industrial uses for the fatty acid and, therefore, significantly increase the value of the oil. Because different species of higher plants accumulate at least 210 different kinds of fatty acids, the genetic resources are available to support the production of a wide variety of modifications of agricultural oilseed species by genetic engineering.

The effect of hydrophobic forces on the rheology of concentrated dispersions of collagen fibers was studied by dynamic rheological measurements over temperatures ranging from 283 to 308 K. The results are interpreted in terms of the associated relaxation time spectra and the theory of Kamphuis et al. for concentrated dispersions. Increases in fiber rigidity are seen from a progressive decrease in the slope of the linear log G' (or G'') vs. log omega data recorded for these dispersions as temperature is increased. A molecular interpretation of this result was obtained by treating collagen fibers as a liquid crystalline phase of rigid-rod collagen molecules that have phase-separated from aqueous solution. Hydrophobic forces affect the volume fraction of water that is present in the phase-separated fibers, which, in turn, affects the rigidity of the fibers. Distinct yielding behavior (in the nonlinear viscoelastic region) occurs at temperatures above 293 K and reflects a gel transition. Thermal gelation of collagen dispersions is proposed to proceed through hydrophobically driven mechanisms of increased fiber rigidity and enhanced interfiber attractive forces.

Samples were taken at days 7, 14, and 21 after implantation. As early as day 7, osteogenesis and resorption were observed at the surface of the biomaterials, inside the macropores. Resorption of both newly formed bone and calcium-phosphate biomaterials was associated with two types of multinucleated cells. Giant multinucleated cells were found only at the surface of the biomaterials; they showed a large number of nuclei, were TRAP negative, developed no ruffled border, and contained numerous vacuoles with large accumulation of mineral crystals from the biomaterials. Osteoclasts exhibited TRAP positivity and well-defined ruffled border. They were observed at the surface of both newly formed bone and biomaterials, around the implant, and inside the macropores. In contact with the biomaterials, infoldings of their ruffled border were observed between the mineral crystals, deeply inside the microporosity. The microporosity of the biomaterials (i.e., the noncrystalline spaces inside the biomaterials) increased underneath this type of cell as compared with underneath giant cells or to the depth of the biomaterials. These observations demonstrate that macroporous calcium-phosphate biomaterials implanted in bone elicit osteogenesis and the recruitment of a double multinucleated cell population having resorbing activity: giant multinucleated cells that resorb biomaterials and osteoclasts that resorb newly formed bone and biomaterials.","UNIV ANGERS, SERV COMMUN MICROSCOPIE ELECTRON, ANGERS, FRANCE; FAC CHIRURG DENT, RECH TISSUS CALCIFIES & BIOMAT LAB, NANTES, FRANCE","BASLE, MF (reprint author), FAC MED ANGERS, HISTOL EMBRYOL LAB, RUE HAUTE RECULEE, F-49045 ANGERS, FRANCE.",,"Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,43,80,82,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0171-967X,1432-0827,,CALCIFIED TISSUE INT,Calcif.

Complex devices such as total joint replacement and the total artificial heart represent combinations of polymers and metal alloys for system and organ replacement. The major barrier to the extended use of these devices is bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, which causes biomaterial-centered infection, and the lack of successful tissue integration or compatibility with biomaterial surfaces. Adhesion-mediated infections are extremely resistant to antibiotics and host defenses and frequently persist until the biomaterial or foreign body is-removed. The pathogenesis of adhesive infections is related, in part, to preferential colonization of ''inert'' substrata whose surfaces are not integrated with healthy tissues composed of living cells and intact extracellular polymers. Tissue integration is an interesting parallel to microbial adhesion and is a desired phenomenon for the biocompatibility of certain implants and biomaterials. Tissue integration requires a form of eukaryocytic adhesion or compatibility with possible chemical integration to an implant surface. Many of the fundamental principles of interfacial science apply to both microbial adhesion and to tissue integration and are general to and independent of the substratum materials involved. interactions of biomaterials with bacteria and tissue cells are directed not only by specific receptors and outer membrane molecules on the cell surface, but also by the atomic geometry and electronic state of the biomaterial surface. An understanding of these mechanisms is important to all fields of medicine and is derived from and relevant to studies in microbiology, biochemistry, and physics. modifications of biomaterial surfaces at an atomic level will allow the programming of cell-to-substratum events, thereby diminishing infection by enhancing tissue compatibility or integration, or by directly inhibiting bacterial adhesion.","INST KNOXVILLE,KNOXVILLE,TN","GRISTINA, AG (reprint author), MSRI,2190 FOX MILL RD,HERNDON,VA 22071, USA.",,,,,,,53,83,83,4,11,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

From biomaterials development to biomedical power sources, the supporting industry and spin-off benefit was broad indeed. Young people were seeking careers in biomedical engineering and science. The National Institutes of Health was supporting artificial heart research at $10 to $12 million dollar levels. Groups at Andros, Inc. (now Baxter Novacor) and Stanford, Thoratec, Penn State and the Hershey Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic and the Division of Artificial Organs, the University of Utah, the Texas Heart Institute and the Baylor College of Medicine, Thermal Electron Corporation, and many more were the source of research and breakthrough development of pumps and systems for artificial hearts. We reported on performance criteria for an artificial heart pump at the First Biomechanics Symposium in 1973 [1]. By the beginning of the decade of the 90's, thousands of presentations had been made and manuscripts written reporting significant progress in the development of artificial heart pumps and systems. The Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health was supporting an artificial heart contract research and development program at a level of $6 million dollars in 1991 [2].

The SECM operates as an aqueous electrochemical cell under bipotentiostatic control with a microelectrode and sample independently biased as working electrodes. Microelectrode current and position is recorded as it is scanned very near a metallurgically polished planar sample surface. To date, the SECM has imaged metallic biomaterials surfaces in oxygen reaction rate imaging (ORRI) and ion release and deposition imaging (IRDI) modes. In ORRI, sample and microelectrode are biased at sufficiently negative potentials to reduce absorbed oxygen. As the microelectrode scans areas of active oxygen reduction, localized diffusion fields with decreased oxygen solution concentrations are encountered and resultant decrements in microelectrode current are observed. In IRDI mode the sample is positively biased and the microelectrode is negatively biased. The microelectrode detects anodic dissolution products with highest currents being observed over the most active areas. Performance of the SECM has been evaluated on Ni minigrids, gamma-1 Hg-Ag dental amalgam crystals, and sintered beads of Co-Cr-Mo alloy which represent significantly different geometries and corrosion processes to help demonstrate the potential of this instrument. The SECM is a valuable tool for imaging microelectrochemical processes on the surfaces of metallurgically polished metallic biomaterials samples and a wide variety of other surfaces of biological interest where charge transfer reactions occur. The SECM allows selective biasing of metallic biomaterials surfaces and Faradaic reactions can be selectively imaged while the surface is in the active, passive, or transpassive state.

For example, polyetherurethane elastomers used as cardiac pacemaker lead insulation have developed surface defects after implantation. This phenomenon, termed ''environmental stress cracking,'' requires intimate contact between polymer and host phagocytic cells, suggesting that phagocyte-generated oxidants might be involved. Indeed, brief exposure of polyetherurethane to activated human neutrophils, hypochlorous acid, or peroxynitrite produces modifications of the polymer similar to those found in vivo. Damage to the polymer appears to arise predominantly from oxidation of the urethane-aliphatic ester and aliphatic ether groups. There are substantial increases in the solid phase surface oxygen content of samples treated with hypochlorous acid, peroxynitrite or activated human neutrophils, resembling those observed in explanted polyetherurethane. Furthermore, both explanted and hypochlorous acid-treated polyether-urethane show marked reductions in polymer molecular weight. Interestingly, hypochlorous acid and peroxynitrite appear to attack polyetherurethane at different sites. Hypochlorous acid or activated neutrophils cause decreases in the urethane-aliphatic ester stretch peak relative to the aliphatic ether stretch peak (as determined by infrared spectroscopy) whereas peroxynitrite causes selective loss of the aliphatic ether. In vivo degradation may involve both hypohalous and nitric oxide-based oxidants because, after long-term implantation, both stretch peaks are diminished. These results suggest that in vivo destruction of implanted polyetherurethane involves attack by phagocyte-derived oxidants.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,A-81,47 NEW SCOTLAND AVE,ALBANY,NY 12208; UNIV MINNESOTA,BIOMED ENGN PROGRAM,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT SURG,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; MEDTRONIC INC,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55432",,,,,,,,29,99,99,0,4,ROCKEFELLER UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"1114 FIRST AVE, 4TH FL, NEW YORK, NY 10021",0021-9738,,,J CLIN INVEST,J.

They are described in terms of a relationship betwen a relative stiffness R(T,M) defined as the ratio between a modulus or storage modulus at a temperature T, and moisture M, and its magnitude in the glassy state. The relationship, in turn, is expressed by the model R(T,M)= 1/(1+exp [(T-T-c(M))/a(M))] where T-c(M) is a critical temperature identifying the transition temperature range and a(M) a constant representing the relationship's slope. The proposed model correctly accounts for the downward concavity of the stiffness vs temperature relationship at the transition onset. Published data on biosolids indicate that T-c(M) can be described by a single exponential decay term, and so most probably also a(M). Incorporation of these terms into the model enables the creation of realistic three-dimensional maps of the relative stiffness-temperature-moisture relationship at and in the neighborhood of the glass transition region. In principle, the same method can also be used to describe the effect of plasticizers other than water if their influence on T-c and the steepness parameter can be formulated as an algebraic expression.",,"PELEG, M (reprint author), UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT FOOD SCI,AMHERST,MA 01003, USA.",,,,,,,15,53,53,0,14,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,BERLIN 33,"C/O SPRINGER-VERLAG, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, 1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY",0035-4511,,,RHEOL ACTA,Rheol.

Yet the majority of these parameters did not allow a clear decision. Only the correlation between implant and tissue provided some interesting hints: Since bone cement guarantees immediate primary stability it is qualified especially for anchoring endoprostheses in patients who will put weight on their artificial joint right after the implantation. A fixation without bone cement could be favoured if new formation and preservation of bone have priority over primary stability. From this derives the following recommendation for practical purposes: Endoprosthetic components should be anchored without cement in patients younger than 70 and in revisions, while bone cement may be used in patients over the age 70.",,"WILLERT, HG (reprint author), UNIV GOTTINGEN,ORTHOPAD KLIN,ROBERT KOCH STR 40,D-37075 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,3,3,0,0,FERDINAND ENKE VERLAG,STUTTGART,"POSTFACH 30 03 66, D-70443 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0044-3220,,,Z ORTHOP GRENZGEB,Z.

Ultimate bond strength (UBS) in carbon fiber/polysulfone (CF/PSF) and polyaramid/polysulfone (K49/PSF) was previously reported to be significantly decreased in two simulated in vivo environments. While UBS is a useful parameter, for orthopedic implant applications the fatigue behavior of the interface is probably a more relevant indicator of long-term composite material performance. In this article, the effects of simulated in vivo environments (saline, exudate) upon the fatigue behavior of the interface of CF/PSF and K49/PSF are reported. The fatigue behavior of both material combinations was linearly dependent on the logarithm of fatigue fife in the dry (control), saline, and exudate environments. Testing either material in saline and exudate resulted in significantly lower fatigue strength than in the dry environment; however, results in the two wet environments were indistinguishable. The CF/PSF interface experienced fatigue failure at approximately 10(5) load cycles at a maximum applied load level of only 15% of its ultimate dry bond strength without indication of an endurance limit being reached. These results raise some important questions regarding the durability of CF/PSF composite in load bearing orthopedic applications.

In this hypothesis, the growth factors and bone cells are involved in the mechanim as follows: first osteoclasts activate the growth factors contained in the bone matrix and release them into bone fluid, then the growth factors are transported to the bone surface with fluid flow induced by the mechanical loads applied to the bone, and finally the growth factors transported regulate the activities of osteoblasts which are responsible for bone formation.

As compared with unimpregnated pieces, the adherence of bacteria significantly decreased to phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces that were either unimplanted or implanted for 2 days, but not for 7 days. The supplementation of albumin in the medium reduced the adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, unimpregnated drain pieces, but did not further decrease adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, phospholipid-impregnated brain pieces. Bacterial growth was inhibited after incubation in nutrient broth supplemented with phospholipids. The incidence of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal drain implantation did not differ between phospholipid-impregnated and unimpregnated drain pieces. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a large amount of biofilm and fibrous deposition on the surface of the implanted, phospholipid-impregnated rubber drain pieces. Thus, phospholipid impregnation of rubber drains reduces bacterial adherence and inhibits bacterial growth, without influencing the incidence of bacterial translocation.","LUND UNIV,DEPT SURG,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,ELECTRON MICROSCOPY UNIT,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,"Bengmark, Stig/0000-0003-1809-8889",,,,21,11,11,0,1,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0300-9130,,,RES EXP MED,Res.

In a canine ex vivo series shunt experiment, very low platelet deposition was observed on these materials and those platelets which were adherent remained unspread. In contrast to this, large amounts of fibrinogen, of the order of a monolayer or greater, were deposited on these surfaces in this ex vivo experiment. This led to the hypothesis that perhaps the deposited fibrinogen did not retain its platelet-adhesive activity. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that these materials exert their antithrombotic effects through the adsorbed protein layer. Protein adsorption kinetics and isotherms on these sulphonated polyurethanes are determined. Multilayer protein adsorption or absorption into the hydrogel-like materials is found for each of the proteins studied, and the greatest amounts of protein are seen on the most highly sulphonated polyurethanes. Further, the blood-contacting response of these materials is investigated after pre-conditioning with either fibrinogen, fibronectin or albumin. When these materials are pre-adsorbed with either fibrinogen or fibronectin, a very thrombogenic response was observed, which suggests that the platelet-adhesive activity of these proteins is not being reduced. Pre-adsorption of albumin did not improve the thromboresistance of these surfaces.","UNIV DELAWARE,COLL ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-24046, HL-47179]",,,37,15,15,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,SEP,1993.0,14,11,,,,,834,844,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90005-M,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,LX408,WOS:A1993LX40800005,8218737.0,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro evaluation can be performed in the presence of human serum by means of techniques described in the literature and reviewed in this paper. Certain physical and chemical parameters involved in complement activation by materials have to be assessed: the chemical composition of the surface, surface area in contact with serum, temperature and duration of contact, and ionic environment with emphasis on divalent ions. Concerning materials evaluation, the adsorption of complement proteins or protein fragments has to be determined in addition to activation. Following screening tests using CH50 determination, activation of both classical and alternative pathways leading to formation of C3 convertases and formation of C5 convertase should be assessed. An example of the determination of the complement-activating capacity of two hydroxylated materials is presented and guidelines for in vitro evaluation are proposed.

Bacterial adhesion was quantified by adhesive coefficient, the percentage of bacteria transported to the surface that becomes adherent. The results showed that surface modification by adsorption of plasma proteins reduced the adhesion of S epidermidis as compared to the bare polymer surface. This surface modification was not sufficient to eliminate completely bacterial adhesion, even at the highest physiologic shear stress level. S epidermidis did adhere strongly to polyethylene surface modified by platelets. This is readily evident as approximately 50% of the adherent S epidermidis were bound to contact-activated platelets which occupied only 4% of the surface area. Adhesive coefficients to platelets were significantly greater than to the protein-adsorbed polyethylene surface by at least one order of magnitude (P less-than-or-equal-to .01) across the range of physiological shear conditions investigated. These studies show that it is biologic surface modification by contact-activated platelets, and not plasma proteins, which mediates S epidermidis adhesion to polyethylene.

Because most polymeric biomaterials accumulate a surface layer of protein immediately after implantation, these adverse reactions may stem from secondary interactions between the host and this surface layer of adsorbed proteins. Using polyester terephthalate (the polymer from which both Dacron and Mylar are produced) as a model, we have explored the hypothesis that surface-adsorbed immunoglobulin might mediate subsequent inflammatory responses. We find, as have others, that immunoglobulin G (IgG) does spontaneously adsorb to polymer surfaces, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, polymer implants precoated with IgG do activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in vitro and also attract substantial numbers of phagocytes (especially polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages) when implanted in mice. However, when implants are placed in mice having a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (and, consequently, almost undetectable levels of serum IgG), a near-normal influx of phagocytic cells ensues. Thus, spontaneously-adsorbed surface IgG does not appear to be o necessary precedent to inflammatory responses directed against implanted biomaterials.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL A81,47 NEW SCOTLAND AVE,ALBANY,NY 12208; UNIV MINNESOTA,GRAD PROGRAM BIOMED ENGN,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; UNIV MINNESOTA,DIGHT LABS,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; CHILDRENS HOSP OAKLAND,RES INST,OAKLAND,CA",,,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI25008],,,45,110,110,0,5,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

Shot-peening has been applied to biomaterials (especially titanium and its alloys) to improve their fatigue strength. It is well known that shot-peening causes surface roughening. The effects of surface roughness on wettability are not well documented. Therefore, in the present study, the effects of shot peening on the initial contact angle and changes in it as a function of time, were investigated. In addition, the spontaneous half-cell potential of all tested biomaterials were measured to correlate the wettability phenomenon to initial surface chemistry. Pure titanium and its alloys, including Ti-6Al-4V and NiTi alloys, AISI Type 316L stainless, Co-Cr alloy, and pure nickel, were mechanically polished, shot-peened and pre-oxidized at 300-degrees-C for 30 min in pure oxygen. It was found that (i) shot-peening homogenized the surface conditions in terms of initial contact angles, (ii) TiO2 oxide shows a higher spreading coefficient, while cubic structure oxides show a lower value, and (iii) the spreading coefficient was correlated to the magnitude of the spontaneous half-cell potential.","BAYLOR COLL DENT,DEPT ORTHODONT,DALLAS,TX 75246; UNIV TSUKUBA,INST MAT SCI,TSUKUBA,IBARAKI 305,JAPAN; MET IMPROVEMENT CO,CTR RES & DEV,PARAMUS,NJ 07652","OSHIDA, Y (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,SCH DENT,DEPT DENT MAT,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202, USA.",,"Miyazaki, Shuichi/A-3113-2012","Miyazaki, Shuichi/0000-0003-3849-4176",,,,19,23,23,0,10,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The lectin Ulex europaeus I (UEA I) has a high affinity for human vascular endothelial cell surface glycoconjugates. Methods: UEA I was covalently bound to polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) with the cross-linking agent 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride to achieve oligosaccharide-mediated endothelial cell attachment to this otherwise nonadherent surface. Results: Experiments with radiolabeled UEA I demonstrated covalent linkage of as much as 1.35 mug/cm2. The lectin binding site is available after the reaction, as demonstrated in experiments a neoglycoprotein. Adhesion studies reveal a 100-fold increase in endothelial cell attachment for the UEA I/polyethylene terephthalate surface (99.7 +/- 29.6 cells/high-power field) when compared with untreated (0.7 +/- 0.5), crosslinking agent (0.4 +/- 0.3), and denatured UEA 1 (1.2 +/- 1. 1) control groups. Five vascular endothelial cell lines adhered to the UEA I/polyethylene terephthalate surface, whereas monocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts did not. Conclusion: These results imply new strategies for endothelialization of prosthetic grafts and promotion of selective cell adherence to biomaterials, with emphasis on carbohydrate interactions. Moreover, this experimental system offers a model for exploring the biologic significance of the endothelial cell-UEA I ligand.",,"OZAKI, CK (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV, NEW ENGLAND DEACONESS HOSP, SCH MED, 21-27 BURLINGTON AVE, ROOM 512, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA.",,"Ozaki, C Keith/A-4937-2013",,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL08730],,,90,8,10,0,1,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

Removal of gas nuclei (denucleation) increases the available surface area of biomaterials for modification and/or cell adhesion, while adhesion molecules provide specific attachment sites. Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) were isolated from fat, fluorescently labeled, and allowed to settle onto expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular patches. Patch treatments included fibronectin alone (F), gas denucleation followed by fibronectin (D/F), denucleation followed by the surfactant tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC) (D/T), denucleation followed by TDMAC followed by fibronectin (D/T/F), or denucleation followed by TDMAC followed by a synthetic polymer with numerous arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequences (D/T/R). After 1 h of incubation, the 45 mm2 patch area covered with microvascular endothelial cells was assessed using computer-aided fluorescence microscopy. Initial graft coverage with D/T (26.2 +/- 2.4 mm2) and D/T/F (25.9 +/- 2.1 mm2) was better than with F (16.8 +/- 2.5 mm) (P < .05). Patches were then exposed to a detachment stress and coverage was again measured. Following stress, coverage was greater with D/T (20.7 +/- 3.4 mm2) and D/T/F (20.7 +/- 2.0 mm2) than with D/T/R (8.4 +/- 1.8 mm2) or F (3.6 +/- 0.9 mm2) (P < .001). Percent retention of cells following stress was better with D/T and D/T/F than with D/T/R, D/F, or F (P < .0001). Scanning electron micrographs were consistent with the qualitative findings. The results indicate that TDMAC alone or with fibronectin increases adhesion of human microvascular endothelial cells to denucleated ePTFE.

In the course of the inflammatory response, the cellular activation triggers expression of a number of enzymes, such as 5'-nucleotidase, which is widely distributed in animal cell membranes as an ectoenzyme. It is now well established that 5'-nucleotidase activity decreases following the contact of inflammatory cells with foreign particles. In this paper we investigate a possible correlation between the enzymatic activities and the dynamic properties of the cell membrane bilayer. Dacron pieces were introduced into rats' peritoneal cavities for a period of 6 h, after which the peritoneal cells were harvested, and various enzyme assays performed, including those for cytoplasmic, lysosomal, and ectoenzymes. In parallel, we studied cell membrane fluidity, using fluorescence polarization of 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH), and cellular ultrastructural alteration resulting from the cell-biomaterial interactions using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Our results show that: 1) macrophages spread around the Dacron fibers with cytoplasmic finger-like projections, but no phagolysosomes, 2) 5'-nucleotidase levels decrease with surgical trauma in comparison with the resident cell exudate, 3) implantation of biomaterials slightly modify the 5'-nucleotidase levels observed in the sham animal, 4) no differences in the anisotropy values indicating that membrane lipid order within the cells could not account for the observed decrease of 5'-nucleotidase activity. Thus, we can suggest that 5'-nucleotidase expression may reflect a particular feature of cell activation without a phagocytic process.

These claims were tested in a cooperative multicenter prospective study of 2,493 inguinal hernia repairs. This study was done to examine the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in primary and recurrent inguinal hernia repaired with synthetic biomaterials. Clinical signs and symptoms of wound infection and the results of each infected repair are reported. The rate of infection was about 1 percent, whether or not biomaterials or antibiotics were used. More than 70 percent of wound infections occurred in patients 60 years of age or older. Removal of biomaterials from the infected wounds was not necessary and generally is not recommended. Recurrence has not occurred in any of the infected repairs. With or without prosthetic repair, the treatment of infected inguinal hernia wounds was relatively simple, of reasonable cost and concluded with a good result.

Here we report the controlled formation of tubular inorganic-organic composites by using self-assembled lipid tubules as templates for the crystallization of inorganic oxides. We use microstructures formed by a sugar-based lipid galactocerebroside, doped with small amounts of an anionic sulphated derivative, to induce nucleation of magnetic and non-magnetic iron oxides. By varying the reaction conditions, we can create either tube-like or lamellar disk-like composites.

The substrate properties of the bilayers for human and rat epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were assessed. Keratinocytes attached and expanded into confluent sheets on both the routine cell culture plastic (TCPS) and the experimental substrates. Morphology of the cells cultured on the biomaterials was found to be comparable with the morphology of those grown on TCPS. In contrast to dense films, porous PEO:PBT copolymer and PLLA appeared poor substrates for fibroblasts. Long-term (in vivo) degradation of the biomaterials was mimicked in vitro to screen the biomaterials for any release of toxic substances.

These procedures consisted of electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis and contact angle characterization surface studies, and protein adsorption, cell culture cytotoxicity, clotting time and haemolysis biocompatibility testing. The polyimide surfaces were invariant from the bulk composition with 60-80% C, 10-20% O and 2-5% N, producing advancing contact angles in the hydrophobic range (80-1000). Consequently, they adsorbed significant amounts of albumin (2-3 mug/cm2) and fibrinogen (0.5-0.8 mug/cm2). The polyimides also displayed an insignificant level of cytotoxicity and haemolysis, and clotting times ranged from 63 to 98% of normal. These clotting times and haemolytic index values were intermediate between the values observed for Teflon(R) and Silastic(R) controls. These factors, along with the strong adherence of polyimides to metal oxide substrates, indicate that polyimide materials are good candidates for further testing as encapsulants for implantable biosensors.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, DURHAM, NC 27706 USA",,,,,,,,29,206,221,2,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUL,1993.0,14,8,,,,,627,635,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90183-3,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,LL696,WOS:A1993LL69600013,8399958.0,,,,2019-02-25

Insoluble polystyrene derivatives bearing isolated sulphonate groups (PSSO3) deplete complement, whereas identical surfaces substituted with both sulphonate and hydroxymethyl groups (PSCH2OH-SO3) are non-activators. Polystyrene sulphonate derivatives possess high adsorptive properties, particularly for serine proteases of the coagulation cascade. Thus, we studied the interactions between polystyrene derivatives and factor D, an enzyme essential for AP activation. C3 was activated when normal human serum (NHS) was incubated with PSSO3, whereas PSCH2OH-SO3 did not induce any specific C3 activation. Both polymers adsorbed factor D from serum, as shown by the loss of haemolytic factor D from NHS incubated with the polymers and by the specific adsorption of radiolabelled factor D. When bound to the polymers, factor D was not functional. The disappearance of factor D was in contradiction to the observed complement activation induced by PSSO3. When other AP components were studied, it was evident that PSSO3 adsorbed factor H even more rapidly and efficiently than factor D. Thus, the net effect was an immediate deregulation of the AP resulting in C3 activation, followed by inhibition of the AP when factor D was finally depleted. Pre-exposure of PSSO3 to NHS prevented any complement activation because the polymer was saturated with factor H, but still adsorbed factor D. Such properties could be beneficial during haemodialysis with membranes for uremic patients who have increased levels of factor D in their serum.","UNIV PARIS 13, RECH MACROMOLEC LAB, CNRS, URA 502, F-93430 VILLETANEUSE, FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 11, CNRS, URA 1218, F-92290 CHATENAY MALABRY, FRANCE","PASCUAL, M (reprint author), UNIV GENEVA, CTR MED, IMMUNONEPHROL LAB 5222, 1 RUE MICHEL SERVET, CH-1211 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,24,18,18,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUL,1993.0,14,9,,,,,665,670,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90065-A,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,LQ251,WOS:A1993LQ25100004,8399963.0,,,,2019-02-25

Table 1 lists the sequence of these events following injury. From the biomaterials perspective, placement of a biomaterial in the in vivo environment involves injection, insertion, or surgical implantation, all of which injure the tissues or organs involved (1,2). The implantation procedure initiates a response to injury, and mechanisms are activated to produce healing (3,4). The degree to which the homeostatic mechanisms are perturbed and the extent of pathophysiologic responses and their resolution are measures of the host reactions to the biomaterial, and they may ultimately determine its biocompatibility and its success or failure as a device or prosthesis. Although it is convenient to consider blood-material interactions separately from tissue-material interactions, it should be kept in mind that the mechanisms involved in both sets of interactions involve both blood and tissue. Furthermore, host reactions are tissue dependent, organ dependent, and species dependent. Obviously, the extent of injury varies depending on the implantation procedure.

The primary focus, therefore, is on surface chemical composition, which can vary instantaneously with processing conditions and environmental changes. The relevance of blood compatibility testing is dependent on the control of applicable variables and an understanding of the state of the biomaterial at the time of testing. An appropriate fabrication protocol includes rigorous planning for and execution of quality control measures in collaboration with those who will design, run, and interpret the actual tests. Adequate documentation, quality monitoring, operator training, and safe laboratory practices contribute to a valid test outcome. Controllable environmental variables include air composition and flow, light composition and intensity, temperature, electrostatic charge, and particulates. To minimize particulate contamination, handling and processing of biomaterials should take place in clean spaces. Substrate effects involving the contact of biomaterials with processing tools, handling implements, or packaging materials must be controlled to minimize mechanical damage or the transfer of contaminants to test specimens. In preparing the test specimen, different primary fabrication processes and subsequent treatments can produce widely divergent properties in the same biomaterial. Therefore a detailed understanding of the physical and chemical consequences of the chosen process (e.g., thermal, solution, reactive, mechanical) is necessary. Secondary procedures such as cleaning, extraction, surface modification, prehydration, and storage will affect important surface and bulk properties of the biomaterial.

A range of physical and biological properties must be evaluated along with the materials' processability in order to fabricate an economical, safe, and effective device. The materials used in cardiovascular devices include a broad range of commercially available materials; however, these materials must meet stringent requirements to be acceptable for use in the body. Specifically, these biomaterials include synthetic polymers, biodegradable polymers, biologically derived materials, bioderived macromolecules, passive coatings, bioactive coatings, tissue adhesives, metal alloys, ceramics, and carbons. Applications for these blood-contacting materials include extracorporeal devices, catheters, and tubing devices, which are inserted into a blood vessel, or permanently implanted devices. In the most basic sense, the materials constituting the device, as fabricated and sterilized, must be nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, nonantigenic, and nonmutagenic. Implanted devices impose a new set of requirements, both biologically and from a materials viewpoint. The effect of a foreign body in the cardiovascular system essentially involves the study of thrombosis and wound healing in the presence of a sterile foreign material in flowing blood. The outcome of this healing process can have profound implications for the success of a device and can be dependent on material properties. The durability of the device will be determined by its fatigue resistance and its resistance to biodegradation. Designs will be increasingly scrutinized for durability by regulatory agencies. Each class of biomaterial for cardiovascular applications is categorized by the material properties. The biologic and physical criteria need to be evaluated in the context of the entire device, its application and duration of use, and how it interfaces with the body.","UNIV TEXAS, DEPT CHEM ENGN, AUSTIN, TX 78712 USA","HELMUS, MN (reprint author), SCHNEIDER USA INC, PFIZER HOSP PROD GRP, 5905 NATHAN LANE, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55442 USA.",,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",,,,62,20,21,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1054-8807,1879-1336,,CARDIOVASC PATHOL,Cardiovasc.

For example, such interactions contribute to anastomotic hyperplasia following insertion of small caliber vascular prostheses and hyperplasia following insertion of intravascular stents. Blood-tissue interactions also probably contribute to restenosis following balloon or other types of angioplasty, saphenous vein bypass grafting, and the accelerated arteriosclerosis that complicates solid organ transplantation. Despite the diverse nature of the inciting interventions, common pathobiological mechanisms may contribute to these tissue reactions. Signals arising from interactions between biomaterials and soluble or formed blood elements can modulate the functions of the cells that comprise the blood vessel wall. In many instances, altered endothelial function may play a primary or contributory role in vascular lesion formation. Migration and inappropriate proliferation of smooth muscle cells also commonly occur during reactions of blood vessels to interventional therapies. Increased accumulation of extracellular matrix materials and, sometimes, remodeling of this matrix often accompany smooth muscle migration and proliferation and participate in the formation of these vascular lesions. Such altered functions of vascular walls and their interactions with blood elements, including the coagulation system, platelets, and leukocytes, contribute to both initiation and progression of vascular lesions produced by cardiovascular interventions. Late in the natural history of these lesions, complications may arise that can yield significant clinical manifestations. Such complications include fissuring, rupture, ulceration, thrombosis and embolism, calcification of lesions and prosthetic devices, microvascular hemorrhage, and aneurysmal dilatation of vessels. These late complications often involve altered vascular cell functions related to interaction with soluble or formed elements of the blood and, when present, implanted biomaterials.","HARVARD UNIV, SCH MED, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA","LIBBY, P (reprint author), BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP, VASC MED & ATHEROSCLEROSIS UNIT, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA.",,,,,,,50,1,1,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1054-8807,1879-1336,,CARDIOVASC PATHOL,Cardiovasc.

The reagents, systems, and technologies are therefore available for a ''reductionist'' approach to the roles of cell adhesion in processes such as the interaction of blood with biomedical materials. Key to the success of this approach is the recognition that the same molecules or families of molecules are responsible for many different processes in organisms that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years. For instance, the alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin receptor that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation and is defective in Glanzmann thrombasthenia in humans is very similar to the receptor that mediates muscle attachment and is defective in fruitflies with the myospheriod phenotype. The challenges to the field of cell adhesion are to understand the events that control the activities of adhesion receptors and ligands, the signals that emanate from ligated receptors, and how the signals are processed to influence behavior when cells encounter surfaces or other cells. To exemplify these issues, this chapter focuses on the alpha(v)beta3 integrin receptor, an adhesive ligand for the receptor, vitronectin; and modulation of cellular adhesion to vitronectin by high-molecular-weight kininogen.

This chapter emphasizes interactions in the blood path, although it is recognized that any device that has contact with internal organs or tissues has contact either directly or indirectly with the blood path. Advances have been made in the evaluation of devices and materials for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The principal methods for cytotoxicity, i.e., direct contact, extract dilution, and agar diffusion assays, have been employed extensively throughout industry, government, and academia. They have been developed into standard methods in developed countries and by international organizations. Future directions will entail refinement of these assays, newer automated methods, and improvements in the understanding and hazard assessment of target cell toxicity. Genotoxicity tests, including mutagenicity and clastogenicity, have had widespread applications in testing pure chemicals. Although the methods have been developed into international standards, there are many deviations and uncertainties in the applications of these standards and the interpretation of data. In particular, there is considerable confusion about the use of these methods for complex mixtures including the extractables from medical devices. There is no convincing evidence that long-term human clinical use of bioprosthetic or prosthetic devices has resulted in irreversible genotoxic effects.

Results indicated that the HA coating on Ti6AI4V lost bond strength when exposed to either a high (>95%) or low (<30%) humidity environment.

These results show that simple biologic assays, such as cell colonization, are not able to distinguish between differences in surface chemistry demonstrated by such a routinely employed surface analysis technique. Thus, there is a need to develop more sensitive biologic assays that provide functional information of a precision that can be correlated with subtle changes in substratum surface chemistry.

For bone repair, their specific function would be to support osteoblast growth, forming a bone-polymer matrix. MC3T3-E1 cells (an osteogenic cell line) were seeded onto polymer matrices and cell adhesion and growth as well as polymer degradation were examined. Both imidazolyl- and ethyl glycinato-substituted polyphosphazenes supported the growth of MC3T3-E1 cells. An increase in the content of the imidazolyl side group resulted in a reduction in cell attachment and growth on the polymer surface and an increase in the rate of degradation of the polymer. In contrast, substitution with the ethyl glycinato group favored increased cell adhesion and growth and also an increase in the rate of degradation of the polymers. Thus, the polyphosphazenes represent a system whereby cell growth and degradation can be modulated by varying the nature of the hydrolytically unstable side chain. This in vitro evaluation suggests that the polyphosphazenes may be suitable candidate biomaterials for the construction of a cell-polymer matrix for tissue regeneration.","HARVARD UNIV,MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPED SURG,BOSTON,MA 02114; PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,UNIV PK,PA 16802","LAURENCIN, CT (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV,MIT,DIV HLTH SCI & TECHNOL,ROOM 141,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139, USA.",,,"Marlow, Maria/0000-0002-0333-5290; Elgendy, Hoda/0000-0002-5573-7419",,,,29,117,122,0,8,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

New methods for tethering DNA molecules to substrates have yielded many excellent AFM images of DNA, even under water. The highest resolution has been obtained with specially sharpened tips, but recent work suggests that this may not be necessary. Control of contamination, and tip-sample interactions (i.e., adhesion) are also important factors. We describe a scheme of magnetic control of AFM cantilevers which should overcome the mechanical instability that places a lower limit on contact force. This should permit active control of interaction forces with the instrument operated in water. We illustrate local force measurements made under water with examples of the measurements of the microelastic properties of bone and of the electrostatic interactions between pairs of colloidal particles. The STM has been used to image small DNA oligomers on a gold electrode in water at high resolution. STM images of DNA bases show that the purines form stacked aggregates with the same base-stacked structure as found in DNA. There is evidence of a connection between the macroscopically measured electrochemical properties of thymine and its STM contrast.

Wettability, observed in the laboratory, may reflect an important in vivo property: the rapidity for extracellular fluids and blood cells to invade the graft and carry bone forming cells.

After two weeks in culture, light- and fluorescence-microscopic and SEM studies revealed significant differences in cell growth. Maximum compatibility was shown by the hydroxyapatite specimen. In the case of commercially pure titanium we found somewhat decreased biocompatibility. Polyethylene was associated with distinct signs of cytotoxicity.

Kinetic profiles of the double-layer capacitance and the polarization resistance were constructed from multiple in vitro and in vivo EIS measurements performed over 60 min at 0 V (reference Ag/AgCI) conditioning potential. The profiles demonstrated that the growth of surface oxides was biphasic, with rapid decrease in the double-layer capacitance occurring within 20 min and reaching steady-state conditions at approximately 40 min.

The biocompatibility of one of the materials most commonly used in the fabrication of xenograft heart valves, bovine pericardium, treated with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde is assessed comparison to a synthetic material, Dacron(R) tricot. An in vitro tissue culture assay, by the agar overlay method, using RC-IAL and Hela cell lines, was applied to treated pericardium and attested the intense toxicity of the treating agents. The subcutaneous grafting of treated pericardium and Dacron(R) was carried out in Wistar rats of 1 to 3 months of age. After the use of the usual histological methods. an evaluation of hematoxylin-eosin stained specimens demonstrated an absence of histocompatibility, mainly as regards for the formaldehyde treated pericardium. Comparatively, the evaluation of implanted Dacron(R) confirmed its perfect biocompatibility. In conclusion, some improvement in xenograft heart valves is necessary, before the surgical implantation procedure takes place.","ESCOLA PAULISTA MED,DEPT MORFOL,BR-04023 SAO PAULO,BRAZIL","PINTO, TDJA (reprint author), UNIV SAO PAULO,FAC CIENCIAS FARM,DEPT FARM,CAIXA POSTAL 30786,BR-05340901 SAO PAULO,BRAZIL.",,,,,,,13,1,3,0,3,REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE SAUDE PUBL DA USP, AV DR ARNALDO 715, 01255 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",0034-8910,,,REV SAUDE PUBL,Rev.

Using supercritical propane, a parent EVAc sample (M(n) = 70 kDa, M(w)/M(n) = 2.4) was separated into narrow fractions with a range of molecular weights (8.7 < M(n) < 165 kDa, 1.4 < M(w)/M(n) < 1.7). Solid particles of Ab were dispersed in matrices composed of different polymer fractions and the rate of Ab release into buffered saline was measured. The rate of Ab release from the EVAc matrix depended on molecular weight: > 90% of the incorporated Ab was released from low molecular weight fractions (M(n) < 40 kDa) during the first 5 days of release, while < 10% was released from the high molecular weight fraction (M(n) > 160 kDa) during 14 days of release. No significant differences in polymer composition, glass-transition temperature, or crystallinity were identified in the different molecular weight fractions of EVAc. Mechanical properties of the polymer did depend on the molecular weight distribution, and correlated directly with Ab release rates. Because it permits rapid and reproducible fractionation of polymers, supercritical fluid extraction can be used to modify the performance of polymeric biomaterials.","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,BALTIMORE,MD 21218","SALTZMAN, WM (reprint author), JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BALTIMORE,MD 21218, USA.",,,,,,,41,35,35,1,8,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-8995,,,J APPL POLYM SCI,J.

After removal of inflammatory tissue the surgeon may be confronted with the need to reconstruct the ossicular chain. Apart from homologous ossicles, implants of different materials have been used for this purpose but often without finding the best solution for the problem encountered. As such, we implanted pieces of human dentin and enamel into the middle ears and mandibles of guinea pigs. After staged placements of the grafts in the animal hosts, specimens were removed and prepared for morphological evaluation by embedding in acrylic without prior decalcification. In a mobile unloaded position within the middle ears, implanted specimens were covered by mucosa and showed no evidence for fibrosis or fixation. A joint-like connection to the bony capsule of the middle ear develops as necessary for a type III tympanoplasty. In a mobile, loaded site with contact to bone, implants were surrounded by connective tissue. In connection with the mucosal envelope, this finding confirms the suitability of the materials for ossiculoplasty. When stable within the mandible, implants were surrounded by new bone formation that originated from the host's tissue only, indicating a favorable result for the obliteration of a mastoid cavity. On the surface of both biomaterials, a cell-mediated resorption could be detected, which was more significant in the mandibular site than in the middle ear. However, the long-term biostability of dentin and enamel seems questionable. The synthetic material hydroxyapatite proved less susceptible to biodegradation when tested under identical conditions in a previous experiment. Apart from this aspect, a tissue reaction similar to that seen with dentin and enamel was encountered with hydroxyapatite in equivalent implantation sites. These findings indicate that hydroxyapatite is a more suitable material for ossiculoplasty.",,"BERNECKER, F (reprint author), KLINIKUM KAISERSLAUTERN,HNO KLIN,FRIEDRICH ENGLELS STR 25,W-6750 KAISERSLAUTERN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0017-6192,,,HNO,HNO,MAY,1993.0,41,5,,,,,250,253,,,,,,4,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,LH654,WOS:A1993LH65400004,8335486.0,,,,2019-02-25

Three weeks after intraperitoneal implantation, the materials were completely encapsulated and the morphological aberration of the peritoneum and spleen disappeared.

Because these receptors are used in normal in vivo hemostatic adhesion, they may also have a role for adhesion onto synthetic surfaces in the vasculature. Platelet adhesion in vitro was examined onto Formvar, glass, and four polyurethaneureas with various soft segment chemistries and surface properties. Platelets were pretreated with RGD peptides before and after adhesion. RGD peptide pretreatment inhibited spreading and close contact formation compared to treatment with saline or control RGE peptides, with no observable effect on the number of adherent platelets per area. High-voltage electron microscopy showed abnormally sparse and short microfilament structures with RGD peptide treatment, suggesting an indirect inhibition of actin filament formation. Video-enhanced light microscopy showed a cessation of spreading and a partial reversal of close contacts following RGD peptide application to adherent platelets. Because minimal amounts of plasma proteins are present in column-washed platelet suspensions, and as platelet secretion appeared to be minimal in these experiments, these observations suggest that RGD binding integrin receptors may function in platelet spreading even in the absence of exogenous ligand. As RGD peptides did not affect the numbers of adherent platelets, while producing substantial decreases in the extent of spreading, we suggest that platelet integrins, possibly GPIIb-IIIa, are involved in spreading on synthetic Surfaces but not for initial adhesion.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT BIOMED SCI, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV DELAWARE, COLL ENGN, NEWARK, DE 19716 USA","GOODMAN, SL (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ANIM HLTH, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.",,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-570]; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-37351, HL-29586]",,,63,42,42,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

From day 7 after implantation, osteoblast-like cells were visible with thin layers of new bone on both biomaterials. Histomorphometry showed progressive increase in volume and surface of newly formed bone. Signs of cell-dependent resorption were visible at the surface of biomaterials and newly formed bone. There was a progressive decrease in relative volume and trabecular thickness of the biomaterials. Resorption of biomaterials appears to involve two cell types: multinucleated giant cells and osteoclast-like cells. The multinucleated giant cells observed had neither tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP) nor a ruffled border. Vesicles and vacuoles containing crystals observed in these cells suggest phagocytosis of biomaterials. The number of these cells decreased after day 14 following implantation. The osteoclast-like cells were TRAP positive. The structured modification and the TRAP activity demonstrated in the subjacent biomaterial suggest that the dissolution of the implant may be associated to an extracellular enzymatic activity of these cells. Electron microscopy revealed a clear zone and cytoplasmic membrane infolding in these cells, suggesting a ruffled border differentiation. The number of these cells increased with delay after implantation. It was concluded that the implantation of calcium phosphate ceramics in bone leads to new bone formation as well as to resorption of the biomaterials. The mechanism of resorption appears to associate crystal endocytosis by multinucleated giant cells and more classical resorption by osteoclast-like cells.","FAC CHIRURG DENTAIRE, RECH TISSUS CALCIFIES & BIOMAT LAB, F-44042 NANTES 01, FRANCE; UNIV ANGERS, SERV COMMUN MICROSCOPIE ELECTRON, F-49045 ANGERS, FRANCE","BASLE, MF (reprint author), FAC MED ANGERS, HISTOL & EMBRYOL LAB, ETUDE & RECH TISSU OSSEUX GRP, RUE HAUTE RECULEE, F-49045 ANGERS, FRANCE.",,"Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,62,31,31,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Other films were allowed to incubate for 4 more days in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum without cells to assess BAEC proliferation. The assay was performed on PEUU films modified with acrylate and methacrylate polymer and copolymer additives that spanned a wide range on the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity scale. Tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) was used as a control. The assay showed that PEUU films loaded with Methacrol 2138F [copoly(diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate [DI-PAM]/decyl methacrylate [DM]) (3/1)] or with its hydrophilic component, DIPAM, in homopolymer form (i.e., h-DIPAM), significantly enhanced BAEC attachment (approximately 80% of TCPS values) and proliferation (approximately 80%) when compared to unloaded PEUU films (attachment, 73%; proliferation, 47%) or to PEUU films loaded with the more hydrophobic acrylate or methacrylate polymer additives (attachment, 32-69%; proliferation, 18-57%). The assay also showed that PEUU films coated with homopoly(diisopropylaminoethyl acrylate) (h-DIPAA) significantly enhanced BAEC attachment and proliferation when compared to PEUU films coated with h-decyl acrylate (h-DA); films coated with the copolymer of these two acrylates (i.e., co-[DIPAA/DA] [3/1]) showed intermediate behavior. To explain the enhancement of BAEC interaction with films loaded with Methacrol 2138F or h-DIPAM, when compared to unmodified PEUU films or to PEUU films loaded with more hydrophobic acrylate and methacrylate polymer additives, it was assumed that the additives near the surface region of the solvent swollen PEUU matrix may have migrated to, or near to, the PEUU-air interface during film formation, creating an additive enriched PEUU surface region. It is suggested that, once at this surface region, dynamic reorientation in response to an aqueous medium ensured the additives were able significantly to influence protein adsorption, and concomitant endothelial cell behavior, but only if they interacted with aqueous media more favorably than the PEUU. The ability of Methacrol and h-DIPAM additives to enhance endothelial cell behavior is argued to be the result of increased hydrophilicity. This is the result of exposed, hydrogen-bonding DIPAM moieties and increased surface flexibility, which is itself due to the hydration of unhindered Methacrol chains, which may create an additive enriched PEUU-water interfacial zone.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI, 10900 EUCLID AVE, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA; DUPONT CO, WAYNESBORO, VA 22980 USA; DUPONT CO, WILMINGTON, DE 19880 USA",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-25239, HL-33849]",,,45,7,7,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The effects of gas nuclei on patency and blood flow were studied in 4 mm diameter arterial grafts (Gore ePTFE; Johnson and Johnson Vita-graft ePTFE; Bard ACG EXS) in the femoropopliteal position of dogs. Control and denucleated (air-free) grafts were implanted bilaterally. Grafts were denucleated by immersion in degassed saline and exposure to 4 torr vacuum and 3,000-20,000 psig pressure. Graft patency was determined at harvest in 46 dogs. Blood flow was measured with acoustic flow probes in eight dogs. Denucleated graft patency was 60% after 2 days of implant while control patency was 22% (P < .05). Measured blood flow was higher in denucleated grafts than in control grafts (P < .02) in 4 of 5 dogs which had significantly different flows. Patency and flow decreased to zero for both control and denucleated grafts over periods of up to 80 days. Air in the control grafts may have been absorbed within several days, leading to late similarity with the denucleated grafts.

Protein adsorption experiments with PAPI-based additives showed that additive loaded PEUU formulations adsorbed significantly lower amounts of the studied proteins than did the unloaded PEUU. Protein adsorption to the DA and DIPAA endcapped PEUU films was found not to vary consistently from that of the unloaded PEUU film. Endothelial cell attachment and proliferation experiments with PAPI-DA and polyethylene glycol-PAPI-DA (PEG-PAPI-DA) loaded PEUU films showed that many of the films exhibited attachment and proliferation that was significantly enhanced compared to PEUU A' and that approached or equaled that of the tissue culture polystyrene control. Experiments with PAPI-DIPAA and PEG-PAPI-DIPAA loaded PEUU films exhibited attachment and proliferation data that was often below 10% of the tissue culture polystyrene control values. Experiments with the DA and DIPAA endcapped PEUU films showed endothelial cell attachment and proliferation that was statistically indistinguishable from the PEUU A' values. Contact angle analysis was carried out on the endcapped PEUU films, on the PAPI-based additive loaded PEUU films, and on PEUU A' using the sessile drop method. The advancing and receding contact angle behavior of the PAPI-based additive loaded PEUU films deviated markedly from the behavior of PEUU A', suggesting that the additives were present at the PEUU-water interface. The contact angle behavior of the endcapped PEUUs was similar to that of PEUU A', suggesting that the DA and DIPAA endcap moieties did not exist at the hydrated PEUU surface in appreciable quantities. To explain the differences in protein adsorption and endothelial cell behavior on the air side of additive loaded PEUUs when compared to the base PEUU, it was assumed that the additives near this region of the solvent swollen PEUU matrix may have migrated to, at, or near the PEUU-air interface during film formation, creating an additive enriched PEUU surface region. Once at this surface region, it was suggested that dynamic surface reorientation in response to an aqueous medium ensured that the additives with hydrophilic moieties (PEG-PAPI-DA, PEG-PAPI-DIPAA, PAPI-DIPAA) were significantly able to influence protein adsorption and endothelial cell behavior if they interacted with aqueous media more favorably than the PEUU. Furthermore, the additive without hydrophilic moieties (PAPI-DA) could influence protein adsorption and endothelial cell behavior only if it existed at the PEUU-air interface in such high concentrations that dynamic surface reorientation in response to an aqueous media would not be completely able to expose the more hydrophilic PEUU polymer chains.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI, 10900 EUCLID AVE, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-33849, HL-25239]",,,32,14,14,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The present concept of a biocompatible material is one that elicits an appropriate host response in a specific application. To design optimal biomaterials, three interactive components should be considered: the chemical nature of the surface, the mediating pellicle layer, and microbial and host response. Surface chemistry determines which molecules are selectively adsorbed onto a surface from oral fluids. The pellicle-coated surface should be designed to elicit a more desirable host response. Pellicle composition can be altered by chemically changing the surface, precoating surfaces with biological molecules, or using synthetic materials designed to mimic natural tissues. Several surface-sensitive techniques are available to assess these modifications, including vibrational spectroscopy, electron microscopy for chemical analysis, and bioanalytical methods. To develop more biocompatible materials, a further understanding of pellicle formation as a function of surface composition, microbial adhesion to biomaterials, and cellular reaction to implant biomaterials is necessary. This knowledge will facilitate development of new biologically based rationales for treatment modalities in restorative dentistry.","SUNY BUFFALO,SCH DENT MED,DEPT ORAL BIOL,BUFFALO,NY 14214","EDGERTON, M (reprint author), SUNY BUFFALO,SCH DENT MED,DEPT REMOVABLE PROSTHODONT & ORAL BIOL,BUFFALO,NY 14214, USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE07585, DE00213, DE09931]",,,95,16,17,0,4,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-3913,,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

The influence of fusidic acid on these 3 factors was studied by using 3 pairs of pathogenic strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Each pair presented differences in the expression of one or several of these factors. The influence of fusidic acid was initially studied by determining the expression of these factors by these strains cultured in the presence of 0.03 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l of antibiotic. Hydrophobicity was measured by the Bath-test method, slime was detected by Trypan blue staining after fixation with Carnov's fixative and adherence was determined on polystvrene. The variations observed were generally minor, except for S. epidermidis, high slime produces, which showed a reduced production. Using this collection of strains, we then selected mutants resistant to 2 mug/ml of fusidic acid. This resistance induced a reduction in the 3 colonisation factors and it can be proposed that strains resistant to fusidic acid have a lesser capacity to colonise than sensitive strains. The bacteria adhere to and colonise the majority of surfaces proposed to them [3, 7, 10]. This was the case for biomaterials used in medicine, whose number and diversity (catheters, prostheses) are continually increasing. Apart from thrombosis, the major complication is the development of infection. Coagulase positive or negative Staphvlococci are very frequently responsible for this type of infection. Two processes play a kev role in the colonisation and development of infection by Staphylococci : firstly, adhesion of the bacteria to the surface of the biomaterial, followed by production of slime, amorphous mucoid substance, essentially composed of polysaccharides, which protects the bacteria from the host's defences and from the action of antibiotics [1, 2, 8, 18]. Antibiotics can act on these two processes and limit the bacterial colonisation [4]. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic which inhibits the synthesis of proteins [9] and, at subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations, it may be able to modify the bacterial surface and adherence of Staphylococci as well as the production of slime. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of fusidic acid on the hydrophobicity of strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, their adherence to polystyrene and their production of slime. As it is possible to select in vitro strains resistant to fusidic acid, the authors also investigated whether such resistance induced a modification in these colonisation factors.","HOP G & R LAENNEC,SERV BACTERIOL B,F-44035 NANTES 01,FRANCE","DRUGEON, HB (reprint author), CERMIA,ROUTE PARC SOUVENIR,F-06500 MENTON,FRANCE.",,,,,,,18,1,1,0,1,EXPANSION SCI FRANCAISE,PARIS,"31 BLVD LATOUR MAUBOURG, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0369-8114,,,PATHOL BIOL,Pathol.

In contrast, erythrocytes attached by nonspecific hydrophobic interaction on uncoated polystyrene dishes assumed flat morphology and remained unperturbed by movements in the medium. The attachment to PVG substratum was suppressed by (1) GLUT-1 inhibitors such as phloretin, phloridzin, and cytochalasin B, and (2) PVG molecules in solution, and (3) at 4-degrees-C, suggesting that the specific recognition of high density of glucose on PVG and the dynamic movement of GLUT-1 are essential for the attachment.

Systems used were poly(ethylene oxide)/dextran/water and Ucon/dextran/water [Ucon being a random poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) copolymer]. The experiments involved the determination of the temperature and polymer concentration dependence on the partitioning. The theoretical results were obtained through a self-consistent mean-field lattice theory for multicomponent mixtures of copolymers with internal states in heterogeneous systems. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental findings show a qualitative agreement regarding the increased preference for the dextran-rich phase at increased polymer concentrations and the different temperature response displayed by the two systems. Furthermore, details about the temperature response, obtained from the model calculations, are discussed. The overall protein-polymer interaction was found to be repulsive and it is dominated by an entropic repulsion due to the restriction of possible polymer conformations for polymers close to the protein surface. The energetic contribution to the overall interaction is smaller in magnitude. It was repulsive for poly(ethylene oxide) and Ucon, whereas it was attractive for dextran for both proteins.",,"CARLSSON, M (reprint author), UNIV LUND,CTR CHEM,POB 124,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,29,30,30,2,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,MAR 29,1993.0,26,7,,,,,1546,1554,,10.1021/ma00059a010,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,KV509,WOS:A1993KV50900010,,,,,2019-02-25

On the other hand, biological biomaterials could be used to carry and deliver GFs to stimulate wound healing. In the present study, fibroblasts were cultivated in a serum-free culture medium onto collagen (type I), hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, fibronectin, or fibrin. FGF, EGF, or PDGF was incorporated within those substrates. Using immuno- and radiolabeling assays, the distribution of GFs within the ECM analogs was relatively uniform and GFs retained in substrates were dependent on the substrates. Fibroblast replication was determined by the incorporation of [H-3]-thymidine and compared to control groups. On collagen or chondroitin sulfate, the incorporation of GFs did not significantly improve cell proliferation. On hyaluronic acid, the incorporation of FGF and PDGF enhanced cell replication at 48 h. The incorporation of PDGF in fibronectin enhanced cell replication. On fibrin, the incorporation of PDGF, EGF, and FGF significantly enhanced cell replication. However, cell replication on FGF-incorporated fibrin was higher by 48 h than that on fibrin in the presence of FGF-supplemented culture medium. Fibrin sustains the biological activity of GFs, FGF in particular, and can be a carrier for GF that stimulates cell replication.","LAVAL UNIV, QUEBEC CITY G1L 3L5, PQ, CANADA; ST FRANCOIS DASSISES HOSP, QUEBEC CITY G1L 3L5, BC, CANADA",,,,,,,,31,38,41,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Cells were cultured on polylactide films and with media based on the artificially aged polylactides, as well as with different concentrations of the final degradation products (monomers). Implant site-related cell types were selected. Three kinds of epithelial cells (middle ear, ear canal and nasal septum) as well as fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells were used. Characteristic of all four polylactides was the normal morphology of cells when cultured on polylactide films and with the artificially ageing media. Although the polylactide films revealed still uncovered spots after 14 days culture, the control cultures were already confluent. The different concentrations of monomers revealed normal cell morphologies except for the 10 mg ml-1 concentration, which showed larger fibroblasts, and the nasal septum epithelium showed more signs of terminal differentiation for the 10 Mg ml-1 D-monomer than was seen for the L-Monomer even if the osmolarity was adjusted. The degradation products of polylactide are not expected to cause adverse reactions when implanted, since cell cultures with monomer concentrations up to 1 mg ml-1 resulted in normal morphologies.

When polystyrene was incubated with human serum, C3 was deposited on the surface by both adsorption and binding dependent on activation of the classical (CPW) and alternative (APW) pathways. After end-point attachment of heparin, significant C3 deposition, although at reduced levels, occurred only by CPW-mediated mechanisms, while adsorption and APW-mediated binding were strongly reduced. Generally, the modified surface bound lower amounts of protein, e.g. serum albumin and IgG, than the unmodified. By contrast, it had increased affinity for C1q which leads to binding of C1 and activation of complement via the CPW. Nevertheless, the net effect of the surface modification on the complement reaction was an overall reduction of C3 binding due to obliteration of APW. This can be related to an enhanced factor H/I-dependent down-regulation of C3b and to the lowered protein-adsorbing property of the surface, both of which have inhibitory effects on APW and on the C3 shunt-dependent activation of the complement system.","UNIV LINKOPING, INST APPL PHYS, LINKOPING, SWEDEN; CARMEDA MEDICARB, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN","NILSSON, UR (reprint author), UNIV HOSP UPPSALA, DEPT CLIN IMMUNOL & TRANSFUS MED, S-75185 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012; Nilsson Ekdahl, Kristina/B-5301-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730; ",,,,30,43,44,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0300-9475,1365-3083,,SCAND J IMMUNOL,Scand.

Tn mutants were isolated following growth at 42-degrees-C; mutants deficient in PS/A and slime production were selected. PS/A- and slime-deficient Tn mutants had a 10-fold decrease in vitro in the initial phase of adherence to catheters, comparable to levels of strains that do not produce PS/A. Introduction of Tn917-LTV1-interrupted DNA from PS/A-deficient mutant M187sn3 into the parental strain via transformation of protoplasts yielded recipients with inserts identical to those of the Tn mutant that were PS/A and slime deficient. Chromosomal DNA flanking the Tn in mutant M187sn3 was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA was found to hybridize to approximately 5-kb EcoRI fragments from the parental strain and from control Tn mutants that express parental levels of PS/A and to either approximately 9- or approximately 14-kb EcoRI fragments from other highly adherent, PS/A-producing strains. Mapping studies demonstrated that in the eight PS/A-deficient mutants that have been isolated, the Tn insertions all occur within a region of approximately 11.6 kb that is defined by three EcoRI sites. These results support previous findings indicating that in S. epidermidis PS/A is involved with in vitro adherence to plastic biomaterials and elaboration of PS/A is closely associated with slime production.","CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,DEPT MED,BOSTON,MA 02115; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115","MULLER, E (reprint author), BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT MED,CHANNING LAB,BOSTON,MA 02115, USA.",,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI 23335],,,36,95,94,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

A hypothesis that is based on surface hydrophilicity, surface flexibility, and adsorption media has been developed to understand the modulated adsorption of plasma proteins by PEUU additives. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and contact angle analysis were performed on two PEUU formulations as well as on PEUU formulations modified with Methacrol 2138F (co[diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate (DIPAM)/decyl methacrylate (DM)][3/1]) or acrylate or methacrylate polymer or copolymer analogs of Methacrol 2138F. Methacrol 2138F is a commercially used amphiphilic copolymethacrylate. ESCA showed that the PEUUs loaded with Methacrol 2138F or with its hydrophilic component, homopoly(DIPAM) (h-(DIPAM)), had a higher percentage of nitrogen at their surfaces than did the base PEUUs. Contact angle analysis also showed that the air side of PEUU formulations loaded with Methacrol 2138F were more hydrophobic than was the air side of base PEUUs when films were cast from dimethylacetamide. However, during contact angle testing, the air side of PEUU films loaded with Methacrol 2138F rapidly became more hydrophilic than did the air side of the base PEUU films. A radioimmunoassay and whole or diluted human plasma were also used to characterize the presence of the proteins fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G, factor VIII/von Willebrand factor, Hageman factor (factor XII), and albumin, on the surface of the same PEUUs as analyzed by ESCA and contact angle.

ESR studies in combination with chemical methods showed that 13-SO3Na-DDHA was an active photosensitizer. An ESR spectrum, assigned to the semiquinone radical anion of 13-SO3Na-DDHA was generated by illumination of a DMF buffer (1:1 by volume) solution of 13-SO3Na-DDHA in the presence of a series of reductive biomaterials. Using 13-SO3Na-DDHA as photosensitizer and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap, the ESR spectra of DMPO/SO3- radical adduct, ascorbyl radical and DMPO/O2.- radical adduct were obtained. Singlet oxygen formed from 13-SO3Na-DDHA photosensitization was detected by means of the 13-SO3Na-DDHA photosensitized oxidation of anthracene and ESR spectroscopy.

Polystyrene in the form of microtitre plates was used as target for C binding, detectable by ELISA using monoclonal anti-C3 antibodies specific for conformational epitopes expressed by bound C3 and C3 fragments. C3 binding in whole blood/plasma/serum is maximal at low dilutions and occurs predominantly by C activation. At higher dilutions, C3 binding occurs at approximately 1/3 of maximal levels and is solely an effect of adsorption. C3 adsorption in the lower serum dilution range, occurs at low but clearly detectable levels. Comparative epitope analysis between C3 fragments, actively bound to polystyrene in the presence of serum, and of iC3b bound to sheep erythrocytes, clearly indicates that C3 binding/activation on polystyrene takes place as a C3 convertase-mediated reaction, which in serum/plasma is followed by a secondary factor 1-dependent degradation of the bound C3b into iC3b. The neo-epitope analysis of serum-contacting polystyrene revealed that the adsorbed C3, throughout the entire serum dilution range tested, deposits in a state closely similar to that observed for purified C3 at a high packing density. Polystyrene surfaces with adsorbed purified C3 expressing this epitope profile were found to mediate APW dependent deposition of C3b in pig serum, presumably by forming a hybrid convertase with porcine Bb. These data therefore suggest that adsorbed C3 on serum-contacting polystyrene surfaces may initiate complement activation via the APW.","LINKOPING UNIV, APPL PHYS LAB, S-58183 LINKOPING, SWEDEN","NILSSON, UR (reprint author), UNIV HOSP UPPSALA, DEPT CLIN IMMUNOL & TRANSFUS MED, S-75185 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730",,,,34,31,31,0,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0161-5890,,,MOL IMMUNOL,Mol.

To support this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical properties of the ventral aorta wall of the lamprey, and showed that the architecture provides a mechanical structure that does produce functional mechanical properties similar to aortae in higher vertebrates.","UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISL,ATLANTIC VET COLL,DEPT ANAT & PHYSIOL,CHARLOTTETOWN C1A 4P3,PEI,CANADA","DEMONT, ME (reprint author), ST FRANCIS XAVIER UNIV,DEPT BIOL,ANTIGONISH B2G 1C0,NS,CANADA.",,,,,,,10,8,8,0,0,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"PO BOX 133 KLOSTERBERG 23, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0014-4754,,,EXPERIENTIA,Experientia,JAN 15,1993.0,49.0,1,,,,,43,46,,10.1007/BF01928787,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,KL308,WOS:A1993KL30800007,,,,,2019-02-25

In spite of these interests, however, only the CO2 + methanol and CO2 + ethanol systems have received much attention in the literature. Moreover, there appears to be some disagreement between the different sets of published data even for these systems. In order to compile a reliable set of data for modelling processes which involve CO2 + 1-alkanol mixtures, we have measured vapor - liquid equilibria in CO2 + ethanol, CO2 + 1-butanol, and CO2 + 1-pentanol mixtures at temperatures ranging from 314 to 337 K and pressures from 4.63 to 11.98 MPa. In this paper, we compare our data with data reported in the literature, and note trends as the 1-alkanol increases in size. The correlation of the data with a simple equation of state and an equation of state based on Statistical Associating Fluid Theory is also discussed.","GEORGIA INST TECHNOL,SCH CHEM ENGN,ATLANTA,GA 30332",,,,,,,,67,16,16,1,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0097-6156,,,ACS SYM SER,,,1993.0,514.0,,,,,,10,33,,,,,,24,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,KL230,WOS:A1993KL23000002,,,,,2019-02-25

The influence of biomaterials on organic matrix synthesis and the calcification process was analysed at the ultrastructural level (transmission electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis). Biomaterials were well tolerated by bone cells. Whichever biomaterial was used, osteoblasts proliferated and synthesized a new matrix constituted of fibrillar and non-fibrillar elements. This activity appeared earlier and was more intense with Biostite than with collagen sponge alone. A deposition of a mineral substance in this newly formed matrix was observed with the collagen sponge and Biostite, but never with hydroxyapatite alone. The mineral deposits were identified as hydroxyapatite crystals, similar to those observed and analysed in bone tissue. These in vitro observations clearly demonstrated the property of Biostite to produce a calcified collagenous matrix similar to bone tissue. However, in vivo confirmation is required before extending the use of this biomaterial to periodontology.","FAC ODONTOL LYON,LYON,FRANCE","SERRE, CM (reprint author), FAC A CARREL,INSERM,U234,LYON,FRANCE.",,"Chavassieux, Pascale/L-9071-2018",,,,,24,69,69,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1993.0,14.0,2,,,,,97,106,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90217-P,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,KK595,WOS:A1993KK59500003,8382091.0,,,,2019-02-25

Fluorescently labelled protein was used so changes in its distribution could be followed along with morphological states assessed with modulation-contrast microscopy. Our particular concern was with the quantitative relationship between the platelet and the fluorescent image. The findings from this study continue to support the idea that platelets do interact with adsorbed protein so that protein redistribution occurs and that thrombin accelerates this. Evidence is also presented to support platelet shrinkage, membrane vesicle formation and destruction as a result of thrombin. The shrinking of adherent platelets causes areas free of pre-adsorbed protein to be exposed. This process will be important determining the nature of the substrate available to cells contacting surfaces along with other adsorbed protein-related processes, e.g. reversible adsorption and post-adsorptive transitions.","MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT PATHOL,HAMILTON L8S 4L7,ONTARIO,CANADA","FEUERSTEIN, IA (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,HAMILTON L8S 4L7,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,30,15,15,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1993.0,14.0,2,,,,,137,147,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90228-T,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,KK595,WOS:A1993KK59500010,8435458.0,,,,2019-02-25

The use of several different endpoints might however generate more information concerning the nature of the toxicity. Thus, we examined the toxicity of two biomaterials, Polyvinylchloride (PVC) and Polyoximethene (POM), with different selected endpoints. The influence of cell growth on these endpoints was also investigated. Water extracts from the polymeric materials were tested on the continuous cell line L-929. Cell density, total protein, total protein per cell, fraction of cells in G0/G1- or S-phase, the concentration of ATP, ADP and AMP were used as endpoints. The PVC material did not significantly influence any of these endpoints until after 72 hours of exposure and the main part of the toxicity at 72 hours was related to higher proliferation rate in control cultures. After the cells had been incubated for 8 hour with POM the main toxic effect was on the energy parameters. In conclusion the PVC material was less toxic than the POM material. Our results also implies that the choice of endpoint will influence the evaluation of cytotoxicity.","UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT ONCOL,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN","WIESLANDER, AP (reprint author), GAMBRO AB,DEPT MED RES,LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,12,5,5,0,1,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",1055-7172,,,BIOMAT ARTIF CELL IM,Biomater.

The complexes (with active enzyme) and control grafts (no enzyme) were implanted over osseous defects in opposite halves of rat calvaria. After time intervals varying from 3-12 weeks, the calvaria were processed for light and electron microscopic examination and histomorphometric analysis. The ALP-containing sheets (but not their controls) rapidly accumulated mineral crystals. As the complexes mineralized, osteoblasts appeared and formed a layer of bone in direct contact with the grafted material. The results indicate that ALP induced the deposition of mineral crystals, and strongly suggest that it is this mineral component which influenced the formation of bone.","UNIV AMSTERDAM, FAC MED, DEPT CELL BIOL & HISTOL, AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","BEERTSEN, W (reprint author), ACAD CTR DENT AMSTERDAM, DEPT PERIODONTOL, EXPTL ORAL BIOL GRP, LOUWESWEG 1, 1066 EA AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.",,"Beertsen, Wouter/B-5308-2013","Beertsen, Wouter/0000-0001-5698-5986",,,,28,12,12,0,0,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0169-6009,,,BONE MINER,Bone Miner.,JAN,1993.0,20.0,1,,,,,41,55,,10.1016/S0169-6009(08)80036-0,,,,15,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,KP198,WOS:A1993KP19800004,8453321.0,,,,2019-02-25

The cells which grew on the materials produced all typical bone matrix proteins and were osteoblast-like as shown by immuno-staining. Analysis of the cell attachment kinetics revealed significant differences within the first 7 hours between the various materials. The best rate of cell attachment was found on the IC surface, followed by the TCP and then the PLA surface. The kinetics of attachment appeared to be due to different surface wettabilities and could be expressed by a linear equation. Further investigations showed an ion mediated attachment of osteoblasts on the surfaces. Quantitative analysis of non-collagenous protein matrix production and DNA content per cell was carried out, showing the best results for PLA, followed by IC and TCP, indicating that the material with the best primary attachment characteristics is not necessarily that on which the cells differentiate the best. Scanning electron microscopy observations of primary outgrowth cultures showed close contact of osteoblasts on all surfaces. It was concluded that such techniques may be developed as a means of batch testing bioactive biomaterials and investigating bone cell/biomaterial interactions.","WESTFAL WILHEMS UNIV,CELL BIOL LAB,DOMAGKSTR 3,D-48129 MUNSTER,GERMANY; GESELL GESUNDHEIT & UMWELTFORSCH MBH,FRANKFURT,GERMANY",,,,,,,,36,83,84,1,10,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1993.0,3.0,2,,,,,129,140,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,MA395,WOS:A1993MA39500002,,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro models of bone mineralization using collagenous substrates have been reported in the literature. This study reports an in vitro system of mineralized reconstituted collagen fibers, with aligned fibrillar substructure. The collagen fibers were mineralized in a double diffusion chamber saturated with respect to calcium and phosphate. The morphology and ultrastructure of the mineral precipitate were evaluated as a function of the pH of the incubating media. Brushite crystal was observed at acidic pH. Large rectangular crystals formed at pH 5.15 and appear to associate with the collagen fibers. At neutral and alkaline pHs, hydroxyapatite crystals were observed in association with the collagen fibers. Spherical aggregates of hydroxyapatite crystals were seen at neutral and alkaline pHs, but these structures were reduced in size when formed on collagen at alkaline pH. On close examination these spherical structures were found to be hollow when viewed in cross section. The crystals precipitated within the interior of the collagen fiber at neutral and alkaline pHs were comparable in both size and shape to crystals observed in mineralized turkey tendon and skeletal tissues. These preliminary observations indicate that with further refinement the reconstituted collagen fibers may prove useful in model systems for the study of collagen mediated mineralization in vitro. In addition, mineralization of collagenous matrices may lead to the development of biomaterials for bone repair and replacement.","UMDNJ, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT PATHOL, BIOMAT CTR,ROOM V-14, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08854 USA",,,,,,,,47,27,31,0,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1993.0,3.0,2,,,,,177,188,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,MA395,WOS:A1993MA39500007,,,,,2019-02-25

The sliding mass imparts a sudden impact load on the frozen surface of the material, creating a distortion free cleavage plane across the material. More traditional methods including bending and cutting with scissors introduce artifacts indirectly associated with stress concentration produced by bending, and sample compression at the edges with cutting.

Eye rubbing by the animals expulsed two of the lenticules and caused failure of two to epithelialize completely. The remaining three lenticules epithelialized, remained clear, and caused no adverse effects on the eye. Two of these lenticules developed focal areas of subepithelial thinning 3 months postoperatively and the third lenticule has remained stable for 30 months. The presence of epithelial attachment components at the epithelial-lenticule interface was demonstrated by immunolocalization. Histopathologic and ultrastructural examination revealed focal areas of epithelial invasion and degradation of the lenticule. Neutral proteases were detected in the thinning region of one specimen.

Despite these impediments, he carried on his classroom activities with typical energy. It was even earlier that at M.I.T., under the supervision of Ed Gilliland and myself, he carried out his doctoral research on the radiation grafting of styrene to polyethylene. Both he and I have dabbled in radiation chemistry on and off since then-he far more than I. Neither of us at that epoch had much idea about biomaterials or medical applications of materials-at least I did not-perhaps Allan had it in the back of his mind.

Significant variations in carbon-fluorine surface functionalities are obtained over a controllable range of film thickness. Film growth rate measurements reveal the occurrence of surface reactions during significant portions of the off portion of the duty cycle. Albumin adsorption on fluorocarbon-treated PET films is unchanged from PET controls for a 100-fold range of bulk concentrations and 60-fold range of adsorption times.

For such studies of surfaces for potential use in bone implants, cells derived from bone may be maintained in culture on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). We have determined the contribution that serum fibronectin (FN) or vitronectin (VN) make to the attachment and spreading of cells cultured from explanted human bone (bone-derived cells) during the first 90 min following seeding on culture surfaces. The attachment of bone-derived cells to TCPS was simulated two-fold by the addition of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the seeding culture medium. The roles of FN and VN were determined by selective removal of the FN or VN from the FBS prior to addition to the culture medium. FBS from which the VN had been removed did not have this stimulatory activity. In contrast, the attachment of bone-derived cells onto TCPS from medium containing FN-depleted serum (which contained VN) was the same as when intact FBS was used. There was incomplete attachment of bone-derived cells (27% of cells) when seeded in medium containing FBS depleted of both VN and FN. Our results show that for human bone-derived cells, the attachment onto TCPS of cells planted in medium containing FBS during the first 90 min of culture is principally as a result of adsorption onto the surface of serum VN. As unmodified polystyrene (PS) has also been used previously as a model biomaterial surface, PS was compared to TCPS for attachment of the bone-derived cells. Attachment of bone-derived cells to TCPS was twice that onto PS, both when the medium was serum-free and when it contained FBS. Bone-derived cells attached to TCPS or PS onto which purified VN or FN had been precoated, with VN adsorbed onto PS being as effective as was VN adsorbed onto TCPS. With FN, there was an effect of the polystyrene surface chemistry which was evident in that suboptimal concentrations of FN had a slightly higher potency when adsorbed onto TCPS than did the same concentrations of FN coated onto PS. When preadsorbed onto TCPS, the potency of FN for attachment of bone-derived cells was at least equal to that of VN.","UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PATHOL,KENSINGTON,NSW 2033,AUSTRALIA","STEELE, JG (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,SYDNEY LABS,POB 184,N RYDE,NSW 2113,AUSTRALIA.",,"Evans, Margaret/B-3261-2011","Evans, Margaret/0000-0003-3078-1576",,,,53,116,116,0,10,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

This article reviews methods of surface modification with water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), albumin, and heparin. PEO is a synthetic, neutral, water-soluble polymer, while albumin and heparin are a natural globular protein and an anionic polysaccharide, respectively. When grafted onto the surface, all three macromolecules share a common feature to reduce thrombogenicity of biomaterials. The reduced thrombogenicity is due to the unique hydrodynamic properties of the grafted macromolecules. In aqueous medium, surface-bound water-soluble polymers are expected to be highly flexible and extend into the bulk solution. Biomaterials grafted with either PEO, albumin, or heparin are able to resist plasma porotein adsorption and platelet adhesion predominantly by a steric repulsion mechanism.","PURDUE UNIV, SCH PHARM, W LAFAYETTE, IN 47907 USA",,,"Amiji, Mansoor/A-4365-2014","Amiji, Mansoor/0000-0001-6170-881X",NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 39081],,,110,248,256,1,74,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Adsorption rate constants and sticking coefficients (the fraction of encounters with the surface which result in adsorption) were calculated from the data. The adsorption rate constants are 4.8 x 10(-4), 1.3 x 10(-4), and 2.5 x 10(-5) cm/s on PDMS-PUU, PTMO-PUU and PEO-PUU respectively.

Conditioned media was evaluated for mitogenic activity using a rabbit aortic smooth muscle cell bioassay with or without preincubation with neutralizing anti-basic-FGF antibody. Results demonstrated increased mitogen release from macrophages harvested from the atherosclerotic rabbits. Only macrophages harvested from normal diet fed rabbits increased their mitogen release following exposure to either polyglactin 910 (p < 0.05) or to Dacron (p < 0.005) over controls. The stimulation of mitogen release by polyglactin 910 did not significantly exceed that in response to Dacron. In rabbits fed normal diets neutralization with the anti-basic-FGF antibody inhibited 100% of the Dacron induced mitogen release as compared to 36% of the polyglactin 910 induced mitogen release (p < 0.01).

Most studies involving shear, however, try to achieve a steady, pulse-free shear stress in studying cell-biomaterial interactions. In this study, human fibroblasts adhering to glass were exposed to an applied 0.5 Hz square-wave pulsatile shear, created in a parallel plate flow chamber by a computer-driven pump. Cells were also exposed to the single lower and higher shear stresses making up the square wave in the presence or absence of pressure variations due to the peristaltic roller pump. Results indicate that cells exposed to the applied square-wave regime showed a detachment rate in between that of the single shear stresses making up the square wave. Furthermore, the presence of the pulsations gave rise to elongated cell shapes in the direction of flow and the formation of a more extensive filopodial network than in the absence of pulsations. This was also true for cells exposed to the high shear component in the presence of pressure variations. Cells exposed to the high shear component without any pressure variations, however, adapted spherical shapes after the onset of flow.","UNIV GRONINGEN, MAT TECHN LAB, ANTONIUS DEUSINGLAAN 1, 9713 AV GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN, CTR BIOMED TECHNOL, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Kallikrein is easily detected by its reaction with the chromogenic substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA, which releases p-nitroaniline, revealed by its absorption at 405 nm. This test, which was already carried out by evaluating PKK activation by the 'end-point' method, has been carried out in this work by the more accurate 'initial velocity' method, i.e. by evaluating the activation from the initial rates of the KK-substrate reaction. The tests were carried out on the following materials: borosilicate glass (as a high-activation reference material), silicone (as a low-activation reference material), the commercial biomaterial Cardiothane 51, three graft copolymers synthesized in our laboratory by reacting ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL) with styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA), and EVAL itself. A mathematical treatment based on a simple kinetic model has been used for a first-approximation evaluation of the PKK-activating power of the materials tested. The quite low activating power of the EVAL-SMA copolymers, which are easily processable into water-permeable hollow fibers, suggests the possibility of their use in blood dialyzers.","UNIV PISA,DIPARTIMENTO INGN CHIM,I-56100 PISA,ITALY","GUERRA, GD (reprint author), CNR,CTR STUDI PROC ION POLIMERIZZAZ,VIA DIOTISALVI 2,I-56126 PISA,ITALY.",,,,,,,15,10,10,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Fibroblasts placed on a sponge of gelatin attached themselves to it, migrated well into the sponge, and remained inside it for at least 7 days. However, sponges of gelatin showed structural instability for hydrolytic degradation by the cells. Most fibroblasts appeared not to penetrate into the interior of a sponge of F-collagen but to remain on its surface when fibroblasts were placed on the sponge, suggesting poor attraction of F-collagen toward cells. Implantation experiments of sponges of F-collagen revealed an intense infiltration of neutrophils into the sponge, indicating F-collagen as an inducer of the inflammatory reaction. These aggravating characters of F-collagen sponges were greatly improved by blending gelatin with F-collagen.

With adherence to technical details (such as atraumatic screw insertion and the fixation of a well-contoured plate), rigid fixation techniques provide a reliable method for the treatment of mandibular fractures.

In contrast, only short-term, largely nonsystematic data are available on the performance of other, newer materials, such as soft silicones based on polydimethylsiloxane and copolymers of dimethyl- and diphenylsiloxane, hydrogels based on poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), and various ''temporary'' and ''permanent'' hydrophilic coatings. Some conflicting reports have been published on the long-term stability of isotactic polypropylene loop materials. However, the medical consensus seems to be that these are essentially stable to ultraviolet light energy reaching intraocular lenses during the expected service life in excess of 20 years. Uncertainty still surrounds the use of various ultraviolet-absorbing chromophores in the optics and/or haptics of intraocular lenses. Published reports indicate varying transmittance and effectiveness of ultraviolet-absorbing intraocular lenses. Furthermore, there is concern about the fate of the ultraviolet-absorbing chromophores during clinical conditions, especially with regard to degradation and leaching. Although a number of papers has been published on the effect of ultraviolet light energy on intraocular lenses, the experimental approaches differed substantively, so that intercomparative deductions must be made guardedly. A few papers have been published on the long-term biostability (hydrolytic, oxidative, and enzymatic) of intraocular lens materials. However, much of what has appeared in the literature is often illustrative of simplistic assumptions that largely ignore the environment of the eye. Clearly, the eventual success of newer materials must be based on performance characteristics that exceed those of the time-tested polymethylmethacrylate and the refined manufacturing technology designed to transform this polymer into intraocular lenses. The unquestioned clinical success of intraocular lenses rests on long historical data with PMMA that are unavailable with proposed newer materials. Thus, the entry of such new materials into the commercial market, meriting the acceptance of clinicians (and patients), must follow rather than precede thorough in vitro accelerated testing procedures under conditions that permit intercomparative conclusions and recommendations.",,"BRUCK, SD (reprint author), STEPHEN D BRUCK ASSOCIATES INC, BIOMAT & MED DEVICES CONSULTING GRP, POB 828, ROCKVILLE, MD 20848 USA.",,,,,,,52,5,5,0,9,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

In all cases the maximum strength was achieved fairly rapidly, usually at 1 week, after which there was little or no increase. Cements stored in water achieved the lowest compressive strengths, whereas cements stored in highly desiccating conditions, over concentrated sulphuric acid, achieved very high (if variable) compressive strengths. There appeared to be very little difference between the water-activated and conventional cements.

Normally, unstable heating can be overcome by heat conduction away from the overheated region, but in cases where the heating rate is very high, thermal relaxation has limited or no effect. We define three stability factors which indicate directly whether or not thermal runaway can occur, irrespective of the heating rate and the thermal properties of the heated material. These factors are dependent on the material's dielectric properties, as well as the geometry and the orientatation with respect to the E-field, of any irregularities. They can be used to provide clear guidelines to choices of source frequency and applicator geometry, which are favorable for the intrinsic control of thermal runaway. Experimental results are presented for a spherical workpiece (representing a cryopreserved rabbit kidney) warmed from -90-degrees-C to above 0-degrees-C in 30 to 60 seconds, in a 434 MHz resonant cavity applicator.

To gain insight into the mechanism of stenting in humans and its short- and long-term implications, we studied the vascular wall of saphenous vein aortocoronary bypass grafts after implantation of the Wallstent. Background. The implantation of a stent in aortocoronary bypass grafts may provide an alternative solution for revascularization in patients who are poor candidates for reoperation. Because human histopathologic findings after stenting with the Wallstent have not previously been described in detail, we examined graft segments that were surgically retrieved from 10 patients (21 stents) at 3 days to 10 months after implantation of the stent. Methods. The grafts were examined by a combination of the following techniques: light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results. Early observations revealed that large amounts of platelets and leukocytes adhered to the stent wires during the first few days. At 3 months, the wires were embedded in a layered new intimal thickening, consisting of smooth muscle cells in a collagenous matrix. In addition, foam cells were abundant near the wires. Extracellular lipids and cholesterol crystals were found after 6 months. Smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix formed the predominant component of restenosis. This new intimal thickening was lined with endothelium, in some cases showing defect intercellular junctions and abnormal adherence of leukocytes and platelets as late as 10 months after implantation. Conclusions. This type of stent is potentially thrombogenic and seems to be associated with extracellular lipid accumulation in venous aortocoronary bypass grafts.","ERASMUS UNIV,THORAXCTR,DEPT CARDIOL,EE 2332,POB 1738,3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; ERASMUS UNIV,THORAXCTR,DEPT THORAC SURG,3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; ERASMUS UNIV,DEPT PATHOL,3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; ACAD HOSP ROTTERDAM DIJKZIGT,ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,37,121,123,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0735-1097,,,J AM COLL CARDIOL,J.

J,"LOPEZ, GD",,,,"LOPEZ, GD",,,BIODETERIORATION AND CORROSION OF METALLIC IMPLANTS AND PROSTHETIC DEVICES,MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRES,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,,,"The use of surgical implants and prosthetic devices to replace the original function of different components of the human biological system is a well established tradition in the history of medicine. Currently, one of the most prevalent points of view in dealing with this subject, is that of biocompatibility of materials of construction and methods of fabrication of these devices, in order to avoid negative impacts on the patient due to failure of implants through degradation mechanisms such as corrosion. This article presents a current general review of the relationship between biocompatibility and deterioration of metallic implants and prosthetic devices, emphasizing the specific forms that corrosion adopts in biological media. The historical perspective shows the consolidation of a tendency towards a more systematic study of these phenomena in recent years, as opposed to trial and error practices that used to be common before the third decade of this century. The understanding of interactions between implants and biological tissue, thus led to some of the most promising current techniques, such as the use of powder metallurgy components to optimize skeletal fixation of implants by means of intersticial bone growth into porous metallic surfaces. The review of metals and alloys currently used for the fabrication of implants shows the amplitude of available technological alternatives, as well as the multiple criteria required to make a good selection for each specific case. Applications and pros and cons of stainless steels, Cr, Ni, Co and Ti alloys, and tantalum are briefly discussed. The introduction to basic concepts of corrosion, serves as a basis for the description of the typical forms that these phenomena adopt in biological media, including pitting, crevice corrosion, fatigue-corrosion, stress corrosion, fretting corrosion, galvanic corrosion, and intergranular corrosion. This review shows that the study of interactions between biological media and metallic implants has become a well established and specific field of science. As a result of this conclusion, an interdisciplinary treatment of the subject of biodeterioration of metallic implants and prosthetic devices is proposed. In practical terms, this proposal can be understood as the integration of an expert in materials science and engineering to the medical team. Thus, quality and reliability of the implant, as well as maximization of its useful life, would be achieved through the implementation of technical specifications, accepted standards, and pertinent testing as recommended by the above mentioned expert, who will be the person of the team more able to grasp the novelties that the dynamic field of biomaterials constantly offers.",,"LOPEZ, GD (reprint author), INGAR,INST DESARROLLO & DISENO,AVELLANEDA 3657,RA-3000 SANTA FE,ARGENTINA.",,,,,,,28,9,12,2,16,MEDICINA (BUENOS AIRES),BUENOS AIRES,"DONATO ALVAREZ 3150, 1427 BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA",0025-7680,,,MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRE,Med.-Buenos Aires,,1993.0,53.0,3,,,,,260,274,,,,,,15,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,LP721,WOS:A1993LP72100012,8114635.0,,,,2019-02-25

The supplement supplied the first population-based estimates of prevalence and morbidity of selected medical devices. Projected to the United States population, the survey results indicate that an estimated 674,000 adults were using 811,000 hip implants. Hip implant recipients were significantly more likely to be older, to be white, and to have lower educational income, and activity levels than the general population of adults. After age-stratification, however, only differences in activity limitation and race remained. Current economic outlays for hip replacement surgery are substantial. With the aging population, use of health services by patients with artificial hips will probably increase unless measures to reduce the need for replacement surgery are instituted. These measures include reducing injuries and improving biomaterials.

While these systems are well known for separating biomaterials, only a handful of papers have appeared investigating their utility for separating metal ions. The few results that have appeared in the literature have utilized salt solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and fall into two categories: 1) partitioning of the metal ion to the PEG-rich phase by the addition of a water-soluble extractant which coordinates the metal ion and 2) addition of an inorganic anion which produces a metal complex that partitions to the PEG-rich phase. In addition the authors have recently added a third category: 3) partitioning of a metal ion directly from the salt-rich to the PEG-rich phase without an added component. It appears that a separations strategy can be developed for metal ions from all areas of the periodic table under a wide variety of conditions.

A mobile laboratory research team evaluated cheetahs using anesthesia, serial blood sampling, electroejaculation (males), and laparoscopy (females). Biomaterials were also collected for parallel studies of genetics, nutrition, and health. There was no mortality, and cheetahs were capable of reproducing naturally after these intense manipulatory examinations. No marked differences were observed in reproductive or endocrine characteristics between proven and unproven breeders. However, males consistently produced teratospermic ejaculates, and cheetah sperm were compromised in conspecific or heterologous in vitro fertilization systems. Structurally abnormal sperm were found to be filtered by the oocyte's zona pellucida. More than 80% of the females were anatomically sound, but morphological and endocrine evidence suggested that approximately 50% or more of the population may have had inactive ovaries at the time of the examination. Males ranging in age from 15 to 182 months produced spermic ejaculates, but motile sperm numbers/ejaculate and circulating testosterone concentrations were highest in males 60 to 120 months old. Parovarian cysts were observed in 51.5% of female cheetahs, but comparisons between proven and unproven subpopulations revealed that this abnormality likely had no influence on fertility. Fresh luteal tissue was not observed in any nonpregnant or nonlactating female, strongly suggesting that the cheetah is an induced ovulator. Overall survey results were discussed in the context of the etiology of reproductive inefficiency, especially with respect to the potential importance of biological versus management factors. Four high priority research areas in cheetah reproductive biology were identified: 1) continuous monitoring of ejaculate quality in the extant population, while studying the impact of pleiomorphisms on fertility; 2) determining the potential relationship between libido and androgen production (excretion) in males; 3) confirming the extent of cyclic, or acyclic, ovarian activity in females; and 4) continued development of assisted reproductive techniques for enhancing management. In summary, a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional survey coordinated through the SSP is both possible and useful for generating a physiological and health database beneficial to driving further research and management initiatives.",,"WILDT, DE (reprint author), SMITHSONIAN INST,NOAHS CTR,DEPT ANIM HLTH,NATL ZOOL PK,WASHINGTON,DC 20008, USA.",,,,,,,0,65,68,2,29,WILEY-LISS,NEW YORK,"DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0733-3188,,,ZOO BIOL,Zoo Biol.,,1993.0,12.0,1,,,,,45,80,,10.1002/zoo.1430120107,,,,36,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,KR769,WOS:A1993KR76900006,,,,,2019-02-25
