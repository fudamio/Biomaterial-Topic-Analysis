The technique now routinely permits quantitative sub-mu-g g-1 analysis of more than 40 elements in bone and tooth tissues at sub-micrometer morphological resolution in three dimensions. Two recent applications of modern SIMS are presented: element distributions in recovering tissue at implanted titanium-base screws in rabbit tibia bone and high-resolution topography and elemental imaging of human dental enamel and dentine. By step-scan and quantitative profiling, the composition of the interface layer between the screw and the bone tissue was studied, and upper concentration limits of element leakage were determined. By high-resolution SIMS imaging new microstructures were detected in the recovery layer. The element distributions and morphologies of the dental tissues are presented in micrographs at very high lateral resolution (ca. 20 nm). For the first time SIMS imaging of individual apatite crystallites and their arrays is demonstrated.","GOTHENBURG UNIV,SCH DENT,S-40033 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN; UNIV CHICAGO,ENRICO FERMI INST,CHICAGO,IL 60637; UNIV GOTHENBURG,DEPT HANDICAP RES,S-41312 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN","LODDING, AR (reprint author), CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT PHYS,S-41296 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,26,27,28,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0003-2670,,,ANAL CHIM ACTA,Anal.

This, in turn, can be obtained from the wave-vector- and frequency-dependent dielectric response function of the system, epsion(q,w), via the energy-loss function, lm[-1/epsilon(q,w)]. We describe two different possible approaches to obtaining these functions, one based on the semiempirical tight-binding approximation, the other using Hedin's many-body treatment of quasiparticle states in solids. These methods are exemplified with calculations for cubi ice (as a model for cellular ""structured"" water) and trans-polyacetylene. The availability of supercomputers makes the application of these techniques feasible.","UNIV TEXAS, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA","ZAIDER, M (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV, COLL PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS, CTR RADIOL RES, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,35,2,2,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1078-3482,,,INT J SUPERCOMPUT AP,Int.

In contrast, most of the existing joint prostheses operate not under fluid film but under mixed lubrication, which induces some tribological problems such as loosening and wear. Thus, recent investigations on the lubrication mechanisms in natural synovial joints and total replacement joints are reviewed, and then subjects on lubrication and wear in joint prostheses and optimum design of joint prostheses with artificial cartilage are discussed.",,"MURAKAMI, T (reprint author), KYUSHU UNIV,FAC ENGN,6-10-1 HAKOZAKI,HIGASHI KU,FUKUOKA 812,JAPAN.",,,,,,,55,53,53,1,16,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS SANSHIN HOKUSEI BLDG,TOKYO,"4-9 YOYOGI 2-CHOME SHIBUYA-KU, TOKYO 151, JAPAN",0914-8825,,,JSME INT J III-VIB C,,DEC,1990.0,33.0,4,,,,,465,474,,10.1299/jsmec1988.33.465,,,,10,"Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,EV405,WOS:A1990EV40500001,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Since the dental implant must extend from the mandibular or maxillary jaw, through the oral mucosa, and into the oral cavity, these tissue responses include epithelium, connective tissue and bone. The continual occlusal forces acting upon these tissues reinforce the dynamic character of these tissue responses. Immediately upon implantation, a healing phase begins as a response to the implanted biomaterial. Following this immediate response a longer healing phase occurs, beginning approximately 1 week after implantation, resulting in the modeling of bone to the implant as well as the formation of epithelial attachment to the implant. This later, delayed healing continues throughout the lifetime of the implant since these tissues must die and be replaced by similar tissues. Current dental research employing scanning electron microscopy is now documenting these tissue responses. This paper reviews, in detail, SEM observations of these tissue responses.","MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL SURG,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT PROSTHODONT,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT RESTORAT DENT,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294","STEFLIK, DE (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,64,10,10,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",0891-7035,,,SCANNING MICROSCOPY,Scanning Microsc.,DEC,1990.0,4.0,4,,,,,1021,1038,,,,,,18,Microscopy,Microscopy,EY836,WOS:A1990EY83600015,2094003.0,,,,2019-02-25

One of the most important functions is the screening for toxic effects of the biomaterials. The spectrum of changes elicited ranges from cell death to alterations of cell adhesion, proliferation and biosynthetic activity. Such test systems may involve the direct contact of cells with the biomaterials or the use of soluble extracts of the latter. The rapid, cost-effective and highly sensitive in vitro methods have to be weighed against the problem of validity of extrapolation to the in vivo situation. The first step in testing potential biomaterials may be termed ""general"" biocompatibility testing and usually involves the use of various cell lines (i.e. transformed cells) which can be easily cultivated and passaged in the laboratory for long periods. Although the latter is convenient and highly sensitive for recognizing and excluding toxic materials at an early stage in the process of toxicity testing, this method cannot be regarded as exhaustive. It is proposed that such screening methods be followed by a second in vitro phase, in which primary and early passage cells of a type relevant to the proposed application of the medical device are used. This ""specific"" biocompatibility testing is an attempt to simulate the in vivo situation as closely as possible. A further component of such a testing scheme involves the use of relevant biological parameters, such as cell adhesion or the production of specific biosynthetic products by the relevant cell type. It is thus possible to construct a spectrum of in vitro changes, ranging from marked inhibition of growth with frank cell death (""not biocompatible"") to marked stimulation of relevant growth and other cell biological parameters (""biocompatible and bioactive""). An expansion of in vitro testing methods can offer a method to ""tailor"" biomaterials for specific in vivo applications. In conclusion, it must be stressed that all in vitro experimentation, whether ""general"" of ""specific"", cannot replace the subsequent in vivo testing. Both components are necessary in an adequate scheme for testing potential biomaterials.",,"KIRKPATRICK, CJ (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,INST PATHOL,W-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,101,101,0,7,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Two new techniques, not previously used in biomaterials research involving the study of locomotor morphology of neutrophils and cell movement through agarose gels, were used in this study. Chromium ion concentrations from 0.05 to 10 p.p.m. and cobalt ion concentrations from 0.5 to 30 p.p.m. were not chemotactic for neutrophils under agarose and did not induce neutrophils to polarize. As neutrophils must take up a locomotor morphology before migrating, it is clear that cobalt and chromium ions in a protein-free environment are not chemotactic for human neutrophils. Concentrations of > 2.5 p.p.m. nickel ions did induce neutrophils to polarize, probably a result of the nickel ions causing depolarization of the neutrophil plasma membrane.",,"REMES, A (reprint author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,INST MED & DENT BIOENGN,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,0,16,16,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The dynamic sorption process of radiolabelled proteins on the surfaces was followed by detecting the radioactivity at the exit stream of the column, which was the response of a pulse stimulus at the inlet. The mathematical model was described and solved using 'parameter estimation by cybernetic moment technique', and the adsorption rate constants of plasma proteins on different biomaterial surfaces were calculated. By evaluation of the response curves with standard and cybernetic moment techniques, the following results were obtained. Albumin and fibrinogen adsorption is competitive, and the competition is strongly dependent upon the surface characteristics of the biomaterial. Preadsorption or preferential adsorption of albumin decreases the fibrinogen adsorption, and therefore increases the biocompatibility of material surface. Adsorption of blood plasma proteins are irreversible. The moment technique can also be used for the evaluation of stimulus-response data of biological systems, to determine the process parameters.",,"MUTLU, M (reprint author), HACETTEPE UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BEYTAPE CAMPUS,GR-06532 ANKARA,TURKEY.",,"MUTLU, MEHMET/B-3240-2013","MUTLU, MEHMET/0000-0001-9610-9817; Mutlu, Mehmet/0000-0001-7146-1937",,,,28,11,11,0,2,PETER PEREGRINUS LTD,HERTS,"SOUTHGATE HOUSE STEVENAGE PO BOX 8, HERTS, ENGLAND SG1 1HQ",0140-0118,,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

The strategy for achieving of biological activity of polymers, the designs of them, polymers syntheses, and biological and biomedical examinations are discussed. As polymeric anticancer drugs polymeric prodrugs having 5-fluorouracil moieties were prepared and their in vivo activity was investigated using Ehrlich's Sarcoma 180 ascites tumor-bearing mice. It was found that polysaccharide-coated-liposome encapsuled nucleic acid analogs show potent immunomodulating activities. This was done by monitoring the in vitro superoxide anion production from activated human neutrophils and in vivo from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, heparin and/or prostaglandin I2-immobilized hydrogel was entrapped in poly(vinyl chloride). From the result of the activated partial thromboplastin time, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and hole blood clotting time using human blood it was seen that the drug-immobilized antithrombogenic biomaterials provide high antithrombogenicity.","OSAKA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL FINE CHEM,SUITA,OSAKA 565,JAPAN","AKASHI, M (reprint author), KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL CHEM,1-21-40 KORIMOTO,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN.",,,,,,,90,16,17,1,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,Adv.

When materials were implanted subcutaneously in animals the cells of the connective tissue capsule can give a good standard for the evaluation of biocompatibility. The application of image processing systems allows the automation of a great number of measurings and test-techniques. It is also possible to get quantitative information on cell- and haemocompatibility testing. With the help of the automatic microscopic image analysis the accuracy of morphometric methods increased and scientists time was saved.,,"SCHREIBER, H (reprint author), DIST HOSP GERA,INST FORENS MED,STR FRIEDENS 122,O-6500 GERA,GERMANY.",,,,,,,11,6,6,0,0,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",0890-5533,,,BIOMATER ARTIF CELL,,,1990.0,18.0,5,,,,,637,641,,10.3109/10731199009117332,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,EZ526,WOS:A1990EZ52600010,2099219.0,,,,2019-02-25

Knowledge of interactions with biomaterials and the resultant pathophysiological reactions is still very limited. The safety of the heart-lung machine lies, to a great extent, in the hands of the operator; precautions against breakdowns and accidents are necessary. The effects of the extracorporeal circulation process manifest themselves clinically as organ malfunctions. The risk is clearly associated with the age of the patient and the duration of the procedure. The fact that the extracorporeal circulation-and with it the heart operation - affects not just a single organ, but rather the entire organism, requires detailed knowledge of the general state of health of the patient to be operated upon. Only on this basis can the necessary individual operational strategies be developed.","BENEDIKT KREUTZ REHABIL ZENTRUM HERZ & KREISLAUFKRANKE,BAD KROZINGEN,GERMANY",,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,0,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,BERLIN 33,"C/O SPRINGER-VERLAG, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, 1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY",0300-5860,,,Z KARDIOL,Z.

The method is based on depositing a pulse of heat into the material of choice, and fitting the subsequent local temperature decay to that predicted by a theoretical model. This transient method is most suitable in situations where frequent measurements of the thermal conductivity are desired. The method was evaluated by calculating the thermal conductivity of several inert materials. The measured conductivities compared well with published values. The developed technique was also used to examine the applicability of the ""apparent conductivity"" index to combine both conductive and blood-convective thermal effects in living, blood perfused tissues. Using both simulated and experimental results, it was shown that the changes in the apparent conductivity are highly correlated with changes in blood flow. However, quantitative application of this index must be restricted to conditions that are similar to those which existed at the time the apparent conductivity was measured.","TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,DEPT VET BIOSCI,IL-32000 HAIFA,ISRAEL; TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,DEPT AGR ENGN,IL-32000 HAIFA,ISRAEL; UNIV ILLINOIS,FAC BIOENGN,DEPT VET BIOSCI,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,FAC BIOENGN,DEPT MECH & IND ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801",,,,,NCI NIH HHS [T32-CA09067]; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL27011],,,17,7,8,0,6,ASME-AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENG,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017",0148-0731,,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.
