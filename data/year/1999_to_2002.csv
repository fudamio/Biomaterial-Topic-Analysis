Molecular biology is currently one of the most exciting fields of research across life sciences, and the advances in a also bring a bright future for tissue engineering to overcome these difficulties. In recent years, tissue engineering benefits a lot from molecular biology. Only a comprehensive understanding of the involved ingredients of tissue engineering (cells, tissue inducing factors, genes, biomaterials) and the subtle relationships between them at molecular level can Lead to a successful manipulation of reparative processes and a better biological substitute. Molecular tissue engineering, the offspring of the tissue engineering and molecular biology, has gained an increasing importance in recent years. It offers the promise of not simply replacing tissue, but improving the restoration. The studies presented in this article put forward this new concept for the first time and provide an insight into the basic principles, status and challenges of this emerging technology.","Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Union Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China; Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",,,"guo, xiaodong/K-2600-2013; Shao, Zengwu/E-9301-2018","Shao, Zengwu/0000-0003-1616-8118",,,,58,11,13,0,6,JOURNAL WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY,WUHAN,"WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-2413,1993-0437,,J WUHAN UNIV TECHNOL,J.

This in vitro study examined the cuspal stiffness of molars restored with a packable resin composite, a conventional posterior microfilled resin composite and amalgam. Forty-eight intact caries-free human third molars were distributed into four treatment groups (n=12) so that the mean cross-sectional areas of all groups were equal. Standardized MOD cavity preparations were made and specimens restored using one of four restorative materials: (1) a spherical particle amalgam (Tytin); (2) Tytin amalgam with a dentin adhesive liner (OptiBond Solo); (3) a conventional microfilled posterior resin composite (Heliomolar); (4) a packable posterior resin composite (Prodigy Posterior). Cuspal stiffness was measured using a Bionix 200 biomaterials testing machine (MTS). Specimens were loaded vertically to 300 N at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/minute. Stiffness was measured at 10 intervals: (1) prior to cavity preparation (intact); (2) following cavity preparation, but before restoration; (3) seven days after restoration; then (4) 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 12 months after restoration. All specimens were stored at 37degreesC in deionized water throughout the study and thermocycled (5degrees55degreesC; 2000 cycles) monthly for 12 months. Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed significant differences among treatment groups over time (p<0.0001). Cavity preparation reduced cuspal stiffness by more than 60%. At 12 months, the cuspal stiffness of restored teeth was, on average, 58% that of intact specimens. Neither the packable nor the conventional resin composite increased cuspal stiffness over that of amalgam.","Branch Dent Annex, Indian Head, MD 20640 USA; USN, Dent Res Inst, Appl Clin Sci, Great Lakes, IL 60088 USA; USN, Postgrad Dent Sch, Great Lakes, IL 60088 USA","Molinaro, JD (reprint author), NSWC Div, 1600 W Wilson Rd, Indian Head, MD 20640 USA.",molinarojd@nnd10.med.navy.mil,,,,,,65,8,8,0,0,OPERATIVE DENTISTRY INC,INDIANAPOLIS,"INDIANA UNIV SCHOOL DENTISTRY, ROOM S411, 1121 WEST MICHIGAN ST, INDIANAPOLIS, IN 46202-5186 USA",0361-7734,1559-2863,,OPER DENT,Oper.

Biomaterials are already in use, but in our experience, an acellular matrix (ACM) can stimulate exact regeneration of the absent tissue. We explored the possibility of using an ACM to repair a muscular AWD in an animal model. Male New Zealand white rabbits (3-4 kg, n = 18) were anesthetized and the abdominal wall was shaved and scrubbed; a vertical incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a large patch of external-oblique muscle was resected (3 x 3 cm). The animals underwent reconstruction with homologous diaphragm acellular matrix (HDAM) grafts that were previously prepared using a detergent enzymatic method. The patches were evaluated histologically at 9 (n = 6), 40 (n = 6), and 90 (n = 6) days post-surgery in each group; moreover, 90 days post-surgery an electromyogram (EMG) (n = 6) of the implanted matrix was recorded. Histologic analysis demonstrated that the HDAM supported fibroblast migration, deposition of newly-formed collagen, and neovascularization. No signs of necrosis, or evidence of skeletal-muscle-cell ingrowth were detected. The EMG revealed minimum muscular electrophysiologic activity, probably due to muscle underlying the patch. The HDAM we employed was thus not able to produce reconstruction of the skeletal muscle, and was progressively remodeled into fibrous tissue. Since the ultimate reason for failure of muscle regeneration is a lack of myogenesis, future studies will use ACMs preconditioned by various regulators of myoblast proliferation and differentiation.","Univ Padua, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Padua, Italy; Univ Padua, Dept Neurol, Padua, Italy; Univ Padua, Dept Pediat Surg, Padua, Italy","Gamba, PG (reprint author), Univ Padua, Azienda Ospedurg, Div Chirurg Pediat, Via Giustiniani 3, I-35121 Padua, Italy.",,"gamba, piergiorgio/J-1935-2018","gamba, piergiorgio/0000-0003-2068-342X",,,,28,48,49,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0179-0358,,,PEDIATR SURG INT,Pediatr.

Surface treatment, such as ion implantation, has been identified as a good candidate to modify the surface properties of the implant to significantly improve its osseointegration. This work reports on the ion implantation of light ions in commercial Ti6Al4V dental implants and subsequent osseointegration tests. Various light ions were implanted W, N, CO, NO with energy ranging from 45 to 100 keV and doses up to 5 X 10(17) ions/cm(2). Both ion-implanted and control dental implants were inserted in the tibial plateau of adult rabbits, the epiphysis and diaphysis of the tibia for the evaluation of their degree of osseointegration. After 3 months the implants were extracted and several histological sections were prepared from whole bones for evaluation of their osseointegration in the tibia. In addition, the surface of the implant, and the interface between the bone and the implant were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. Some ion implantation treatments did not significantly change the performance of the dental implants relative to the untreated implants, while tests showed that the ion implantation of CO remarkably improved the osseointegration properties, i.e. the percentage of bone and implant in contact.

Fretting decreases dynamic durability and produces wear debris, etc. These can cause various effects on the human body and therefore, it is necessary to know the fretting fatigue characteristics of biomaterials in vivo in order to avoid these effects. In this study, plain fatigue and fretting fatigue tests were carried out in air and in vivo environment, that is, in Ringer's solution on Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, which has been developed recently for biomedical materials, and also on conventional biomedical material, Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al. In both low cycle fatigue and high cycle fatigue life regions, fretting fatigue strength of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr and Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al subjected to various heat treatments decreases remarkably as compared with their plain fatigue strength. In this case, the decreasing ratio of fatigue life by fretting increases with increasing the crack growth area, which is caused by the tangential force at the contact plane of pad. In fretting fatigue in air, degree of damage by fretting, which is indicated by Pf/Ff where Pf and Ff are the plain fatigue limit and fretting fatigue limit, respectively, increases with increasing elastic modulus and hardness. In fretting fatigue in vivo environment, passive film on specimen surface is destroyed by fretting action even in Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, which has excellent corrosion resistance, and, as a result, corrosion pits that lead to decreasing fretting fatigue strength especially in high cycle fatigue life region, are formed on its surface.","Toyohashi Univ Technol, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan; Aichi Gakuin Univ, Sch Dent, Nagoya, Aichi 464, Japan; Daido Steel Co Ltd, R&D Lab, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Niinomi, M (reprint author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, 1-1 Hibarigaoka Tempaku Cho, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan.",,"Niinomi, Mitsuo/B-5965-2011",,,,,16,13,13,2,11,IRON STEEL INST JAPAN KEIDANREN KAIKAN,TOKYO,"9-4 OTEMACHI 1-CHOME CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100, JAPAN",0021-1575,,,TETSU TO HAGANE,Tetsu To Hagane-J.

An excessive friction wear is one of the main causes of looseness in artificial hip joints because the progress of wear depresses the mobility and load capacity of the artificial hip joints. While, titanium and its alloys are well known to have excellent biocompatibility among the metallic materials. However, wear resistance of titanium and its alloys is considerably lower than that of Co-Cr alloy and SUS316L stainless steel, which are conventional biomaterials. In this study, therefore, the oxidation treatment was carried out to improve wear resistance of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, a new beta-type titanium alloy, and Ti-6Al-4V ELI, a typical conventional titanium alloy, for biomedical applications. The following results were obtained. In oxidized Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, the alpha phase precipitates below oxide layer on the specimen surface. The highest hardness is obtained in the vicinity of boundary between oxide layer and oxygen solution layer in oxidized Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr. When the oxidation treatment is conducted with Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, oxygen solute in the alloy is greater than that in Ti-6Al-4V ELI. Therefore, the oxide layer of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr shows no exfoliation. For a oxidation treatment temperature of 773K, weight loss of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr decreases with increasing treatment time. However, weight loss of Ti-6Al-4V ELI increases in this case. For a oxidation treatment temperature of 1073K, weight loss decreases in both Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr and Ti-6Al-4V ELI with increasing treatment time. From the above results, it can be concluded that oxidation treatment is the effective way to improve wear resistance of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr.","Toyohashi Univ Technol, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan; Aichi Gakuin Univ, Sch Dent, Nagoya, Aichi 464, Japan; Daido Steel Co Ltd, R&D Lab, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Niinomi, M (reprint author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, 1-1 Hibarigaoka Tempaku Cho, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan.",,"Niinomi, Mitsuo/B-5965-2011",,,,,16,20,20,0,4,IRON STEEL INST JAPAN KEIDANREN KAIKAN,TOKYO,"9-4 OTEMACHI 1-CHOME CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100, JAPAN",0021-1575,,,TETSU TO HAGANE,Tetsu To Hagane-J.

The thermal cis-to-trans isomerization behavior of the azo groups was measured by means of flash photolysis to investigate self-assembled structure in solution. The rate constants observed for the azo-containing polymers permit an estimation of how the thermal isomerization is influenced by both polymer and solution properties. In pure THF the relaxation was observed to be the usual monoexponential decay. In mixed aqueous-organic solvent solutions however, all poly(DR1A-co-AA) samples showed a highly unusual biexponential rate decay, with both a slow isomerization process due to inhibited mobility of the azo groups, and a faster isomerization process for unaggregated azo groups. In these systems, the relaxation of the cis-isomer was fit well with a biexponential function, which clearly demonstrates two distinct local chromophore environments. The spectroscopic results of this study suggest that weakly aggregated states of the amphiphilic polymers in an aqueous-organic solution can be readily studied through the simple technique of isomerization spectroscopy to estimate the fractions of aggregated groups involved and their local environment.","McGill Univ, Dept Chem, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Barrett, CJ (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Chem, 801 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",,"Barrett, Christopher/B-7474-2008",,,,,22,15,15,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

Analysis of the fitted parameters suggests that the average water mobility in these materials is largely governed by the EWC, although at a given EWC, slightly increased mobility (decreased average binding) was found in the IGEL materials that possess no exchangeable protons on the polymer chains. The combination of T-1 and T-2 measurements in a single model allows more accurate quantification of water and polymer mobility and binding in these hydrogels. The methodology outlined in this study should also be applicable to other hydrogel systems.","Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Phys & Chem Sci, Ctr Med Hlth & Environm Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Pope, JM (reprint author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Phys & Chem Sci, Ctr Med Hlth & Environm Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",,"Whittaker, Michael/C-2449-2008","Whittaker, Michael/0000-0001-5706-3932; Pope, James/0000-0002-5407-1299",,,,19,36,36,0,29,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,AUG 27,2002.0,35,18,,,,,6961,6969,,10.1021/ma020539c,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,588EQ,WOS:000177688800033,,,,,2019-02-25

The improvement of blood compatibility is always an important research task for biomaterial research and development. It is an important way to, develop biomaterials by constructing special molecules onto the proper mechanical material surface. Polyetherurethanes are widely used as biomaterials due to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, their blood compatibility is still not adequate for the more demanding applications. The purpose of present study was to synthesis a novel nonthrombogenic biomaterial by modifying the surface of polyetherurethane. Ozone was used to introduce active peroxide groups onto polyetherurethane surface and graft polymerization of N, N-dimethyl-N-methacryloxyethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium (DMMSA), a sulfobetaine structure, onto the ozone activated polyetherurethane surface was conducted. The nonthrombogenic properties of grafted film were also studied. The grafted film was characterized by ATR-FTIR, XPS and contact angle measurement. The ATR-FTIR, XPS of the grafted PU film indicated that the graft polymerization did take place,the grafted PU film surface was covered with the DMMSA polymer. The grafting yields in different condition were studied. The grafting yields increased with the increase of the monomer concentration. Water absorption and contact angle. showed that the hydrophilicity of the film had been improved I greatly, and the hydrophilicity of the film increased with I the grafting yield.-The blood compatibility of the grafted films was evaluated by platelet adhesion in platelet rich. plasma and scanning electron microscopy observation, using PU film as the reference. No platelet adhesion was observed for the grafted films incubated for 60 min and 180. min, however, the ungrafted PU film was covered with platelet. The result of platelet adhesion experiment indicated that. the PDMMSA chains could prevent platelet adhesion. That means; this new material is expected, to have-potential biomedical applications.","Nanjing Univ, Res Ctr Surfce & Interface Chem & Engn Technol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Ai, F (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Res Ctr Surfce & Interface Chem & Engn Technol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,16,10,13,0,5,SCIENCE CHINA PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3304,,,ACTA POLYM SIN,Acta Polym.

Although biomaterials have already made an enormous impact in biomedical research and clinical practice, there is a need for better understanding of the surface and interfacial chemistry between tissue (or cells) and biomedical materials. This is because the detailed physicochemical events related to the biological response to the surface of materials still often remain obscure, even though surface properties are important determinants of biomedical material function. In this regard, data available in the literature show the complexity of the interactions (surface reorganization, nonspecific/specific protein adsorption, and chemical reactions such as acid-base, ion pairing, ion exchange, hydrogen bonding, divalent-ion bridging) and the interrelationship between biological environments, interfacial properties, and surface functional groups responsible for the biological responses. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of surface and interfacial phenomena at the surface of biomedical polymers, this review focuses on several aspects of current work published on poly(alpha-hydroxy acid)s and their associated copolymers: surface structure-biomedical function relationships; physicochemical strategies for surface modification; and, finally, synthetic strategies to increase biocompatibility for specific in-vivo and/or in-vitro biomedical applications.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Chem, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Gardella, JA (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Chem, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",gardella@acsu.buffalo.edu,,,,,,132,24,25,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1618-2642,1618-2650,,ANAL BIOANAL CHEM,Anal.

Four different kinds of alginate-amino acid derivatives were synthesized to mimic the glycocalyx of cell membrane to promote chondrogenesis. The alginate-amino acid derivatives were characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and UV spectra and the amino acid content on alginate-amino acid derivatives was given by ninhydrin-UV method. A new strategy, entrapment, was then employed to modify PDL-LA membranes with alginate and its amino acid derivatives. The results of XPS, ATR-FTIR and contact angle confirmed that a stable thin film of alginate and its amino acid derivatives can be entrapped on the surface of PDL-LA membrane. The chondrocyte cytocompatibility test and MTT assays indicated that the alginate-amino acid derivatives modified PDL-LA membranes could promote chondrogenesis.

Because the surface is in direct contact with cells, both chemical and topographical properties of a material surface can play a crucial role. In this study, parallel ridges/grooves were micropatterned on glass surfaces using photosensitive polyimide to create transparent substrates. The migratory behavior of live human neutrophils on the patterned surfaces was observed using a light microscope with transmitted light source. The width (2 mum) and length (400 mum) of the ridges were kept constant. The height (5 or 3 mum) and the repeat spacing (6-14 mum) of the ridges were systematically changed to investigate the effect of microgeometry on neutrophil migration. In addition, the effect of surface chemistry on neutrophil migration was studied by deposition of a thin layer of ""inert"", biocompatible metal such as Au-Pd alloy and titanium on patterned substrates. More than 95% of neutrophils moved in the direction of the long axis of ridges/grooves regardless of the topographical geometry and chemistry, consistent with a phenomenon termed ""contact guidance"". Therefore, cell migration was characterized using a one-dimensional persistent random walk. The rate of cell movement was strongly dependent oil the topographical microgeometry of the ridges. The random motility coefficient mu, 9.8 x 10(-9) cm(2)/s, was the greatest at a ridge height of 5 pin and spacing of 10 mum, about 10 times faster than on smooth glass surface. The Au-Pd coating did not change neutrophil migratory behavior on patterned surfaces, whereas titanium decreased cell motility Substantially. The results of this study suggest that optimization of both surface chemistry and topography may be important when designing biomaterials for tissue engineering. In addition, parallel ridges/grooves can be used to control the direction and rate of cell migration on the surface.

Osteoblasts of five patients were seeded onto the three biomaterials and two different parameters were varied: the time intervals between initial seeding, and adding culture medium (2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h) and the seeding corceini-ation (1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) cells/ml) ofcclls onto biomaterials. The results of the study demonstrated that the time interval between seeding osteoblasts and adding Culture medium as well as the seeding concentration effects the cell proliferation and the cell colonization. The best proliferation rate was achieved by adding the culture medium 2 h after initial seeding and with a seeding density of 1 x 10(5) cells/ml. Moreover, all three biomaterials resulted in different proliferation rates. The best proliferation rate resulted with the bovine collagen membrane. In Conclusion, the examined parameters are very important for the development of the tissue engineering techniques and in a larger perspective also for reconstructive surgery.

Protein extraction after tissue homogenisation ill the presence of detergents showed that crosslinking using GA or DPPA 1,VIS Much more effective. The amounts of protein extracted from these twogroups of chemically modified pericardium were significantly lower the other modified tissues presented only a slight reduction when compared with untreated tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases- (MMP) 2 and 9 were detected in native pericardium from calf mid pig by zymography. While the MMP-9/ MMP-2 activity ratio was close to 1 in pig pericardium, it was 8.5-fold higher in bovine tissue. Crosslinking with GA and with DPPA almost completely abolished gelatinase activities, even when equal amounts of solubilised protein were loaded onto the zymograms. Anticalcification treatments Followed by GA crosslinking or treatment with EDAC were not as effective in reducing gelatinase activities: but, increasing, a relative reduction of MMP-9 versus MMP-2 was detected. The presence of these gelatinase activities in pericardium may contribute to the in vivo degradability of pericardium-based cardiac valves. (C) 2002 Elsevier science Ltd.

The biocompatibility is beyond that greatly influenced by the design of the medical device which has to be planned close to the material's properties and the function within the body. Physical chemical reactions at and physical properties of the surface which influence the adsorption behavior for biomacromolecules. Conformational or functional changes of f.i. proteins due to physical forces originating from the surface could be the communication messages to the immunological system. The immersion of a material into an aqueous electrolyte leads generally to a space charge layer on both sides of the interface forming the electrical double layer, physically described by the isoelectric point of the materials surface. A numerical example hints on the importance of the double layer structure for the 'communication' between an implant and the surrounding extracellular fluid including beside ions complex structured proteins as biomacromolecules. Biocompatibility depends on the physical structure of the material and physicochemical properties of the interface to the biosystem. The conductivity of the surface film control reactions across the interface with biomacromolecules of the biological environment. Conformational unchanged macromolecules are the prior condition for biocompatibility and controls the attachment and probably also the degree of attachment via adhesion proteins. Later on, when the cells develop tension through the cytoskeleton on these attachment sites, the strength of the integrin adhesion protein-matrix protein interaction might probably prove decisive in differentiation state of the cell. It has been proved by molecular biological methods that an undestroyed oxide layer of anatase on titanium through passivation leaves for instance albumin conformational unchanged.

In the present communication we report the quantitative analysis of the porosity and of the pore architecture. First, we elucidate that synchrotron radiation at the photon energy of 9 keV has an appropriate cross section for this low-weight material. Modifications in sponge micro-architecture during measurement are not detected. Second, the treatment of the data, an amount of 2.5 Gbyte to generate binary data is described. We compare the 3-D with the 2-D analysis in a quantitative manner. The obtained values for the mean distance to material within the sponge calculated from 2-D and 3-D data of the whole tomogram differ significantly: 12.5 mum for 3-D and 17.6 mum for 2-D analysis. If the pores exhibit a spherical shape as frequently found, the derived mean pore diameter, however, is overestimated only by 6% in the 2-D image analysis with respect to the 3-D evaluation.

This parameter is scale-independent and can be used to compare the organization of a surface at different scales of range and amplitude. To test the accuracy of this roughness parameter versus a hundred existing ones, we created an original statistical bootstrap method. In order to assess the physical relevance of this new parameter, we elaborated a great number of surfaces with various roughness amplitudes on titanium and titanium-based alloys using different physical processes. Then we studied the influence of the roughness amplitude on in vitro adhesion and proliferation of human osteoblasts. It was then shown that our new parameter best discriminates among the cell adhesion phenomena than other parameters (average roughness (Ra...)): cells adhere better on isotropic surfaces with a low order, provided this order is quantified on a scale that is more important than that of the cells. Additionally, on these low ordered metallic surfaces, the shape of the cells presents the same morphological aspect as that we can see on the human bone trabeculae. The method used to prepare these isotropic surfaces (electroerosion) could be undoubtedly and easily applied to prepare most biomaterials with complex geometries and to improve bone implant integration. Moreover, the new order parameter we developed may be particularly useful for the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of bone cell installation on a relief and of the formation of bone cell-material interface.

The routine controls used in clinical chemistry and hematology have to be performed. Information about normal ranges (mean value, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval) should be provided. Tests have to be performed within a minimal delay of usually 2 h since some properties of blood change rapidly following collection. Various conditions (depending on the wall shear rate) were simulated within the centrifugation system and a Chandler system. Qualities and aspects of hemocompatibility such as platelet activation, oxidative burst, hemolysis, fibrinolysis, fibrin formation, generation of thrombin, contact activation, and complement activation were analysed and the results were entered non-dimensionally into a non-dimensional score system, where 0 points stand for the best and 65 points for the worst evaluation. We found a good correlation between the total score and contact activation, thrombin generation and leukocyte activation in a low shear stress system and a good correlation between the total score and thrombin generation, hemolysis and platelet activation in the high shear stress system. Further on the effect of additives and sterilization procedures can be measured.

This investigation was also designated to the establishment of a cytotoxicity index (CI) such as it was described for hemocompatibility testing. The following materials were tested: 36 commercial alloys (Au-, Pd- and Ag-base), 14 experimental alloys (Pd-base established by an experience plan) and pure metals (Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Cr, In, Sri, Pt, Ti, Zn). The cells culture experiments were carried out with epithelial L132 cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In vitro cell viability tests show that Pt, Sri, In, Ti, Au and Pd have no cytotoxic effect; Cr, Cu and Ag are toxic, Ni, Zn, and Co are highly toxic. An identical ranking was found with the inflammatory and proliferation tests. Toxic and highly toxic metals induced slight or strong prosthetic dental restoration morphological alterations after 3-days cultures and mostly cell death after 6-days cultures. These effects are dependent on the leakage of the element into the culture medium as revealed by ICP. The addition of Au gives benefit to Pd-Ag alloys, but does not produce any major effect on Pd-Cu alloys.

Standardised test samples with five different surface preparations are used: sandblasted, 80, 1200, and 4000 grade polished, mirror polished. Surface roughness is analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and LASER Confocal Microscopy. Cell culture experiments are performed with MC3T3-E 1 mouse osteoblasts after 3 days culture: proliferation rate, morphology and adhesion are assessed. The variations of expression of cell adhesion proteins are evidenced by indirect immune fluorescence method: actin from the cytoskeleton, vinculin from the focal adhesion complex, fibronectin and collagen I from the extracellular matrix. The results reveal a clear influence of surface roughness of Ti6Al4V on cell proliferation, morphology and adhesion. A significant correlation is established between surface roughness and cell growth. More the surface is smooth more the osteoblasts proliferate and appear spread out on the test samples. In addition, the expression of adhesion proteins varies with respect to the surface roughness. These results indicate a direct relationship between the decrease of cell adhesion and the increase of cell proliferation on mirror polished materials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Until now the type and extent of such reactions to give optimal integration of various biomaterials are practically unknown. Three principal fields of research can yield useful data to understand these phenomena better: studies on explanted biomaterials, animal models and relevant in vitro techniques. This paper will present examples of the latter field and the application of endothelial cell (EC) culture systems to study the effects of important tissue (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines) and material (e.g. metal ions, particulate debris) factors on the regulation of the inflammatory and angiogenic response. A central feature is the use of microvascular endothelial cells (MEC), which can be used in both 2-and 3-dimensional (3-D) assays. We have also used genetic manipulation to develop a permanent MEC line from the human lung (HPMEC-ST1), which is being tested for its suitability to study cell-biomaterial interactions. In addition, suitable in vitro techniques are being developed in order to investigate drug delivery systems (DDS). Of particular interest is the targeting of the central nervous system, our approach being to establish a human model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A mainstay of our scientific philosophy is that such in vitro methods can make an important contribution to understanding biological reactions at the tissue-biomaterial interface and thus further a causal approach to tissue engineering (TE) and drug delivery applications.

The visualisation of the morphology of cells adhered onto a surface allows to derive nuclear apoptotic signs or even the existence of organisation between groups of these cells. The technique is based on the use of an auto-immune reaction combined with a fluorescent agent that allows a direct inspection of the cell behaviour. The versatility of the technique is demonstrated by presenting several examples with different cultured cells (human chondrosarcome cells (CSRCs) and pluripotential mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow) seeded over two different Ti-based surfaces (TiO2 and TiN, respectively). These in-vitro observations are compared with the behaviour of the same cells on bare TiAlV alloy. From our results it is concluded that both TiO2 and TiN surfaces show enhanced biological responses.

The short and long term results of meshes are convincing concerning complications, recurrence rate and patient's comfort. On the other hand side some scientific groups discuss the possibility of malignant tumor development due to implanted meshes. In fact, experimental models exist which demonstrate that soft tissue sarcomas can be induced in mice and rats by implanting artificial materials such as synthetics or metal. Beside millions of hernia repairs using meshes worldwide no patient has been reported with a soft tissue tumor until today. The analyses of molecular markers of proliferation, of apoptosis as well as the modulation of heat shock-proteins seem not to prove the carcinogenic potential of meshes. In conclusion, there are no data so far indicating a real risk for humans to develop malignant tumors due to implanted meshes. Therefore we further propagate the implantation of meshes in hernia repair in adult patients.","Univ Klinikum Gottingen, Klin & Poliklin Allgemeinchirurg, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Becker, H (reprint author), Univ Klinikum Gottingen, Klin & Poliklin Allgemeinchirurg, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",,,,,,,47,13,14,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0009-4722,,,CHIRURG,Chirurg,AUG,2002.0,73,8,,,,,833,837,,10.1007/s00104-002-0488-3,,,,5,Surgery,Surgery,588ZE,WOS:000177731700010,12425161.0,,,,2019-02-25

Biofilm cells produce another antigen, termed polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is composed of a similar to28 kDa soluble linear beta(1-6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine. We developed a new method to purify PS/A from S. aureus MN8m, a strain hyperproducing PS/A. Using multiple analytical techniques, we determined that the chemical structure of PS/A is also beta(1-6)-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG). We were unable to find N-succinylglucosamine residues in any of our preparations in contrast to previously reported findings (D. McKenney, K. Pouliot, Y. Wang, V. Murthy, M. Ulrich, G. Doring, J. C. Lee, D. A Goldmann, and G. B. Pier, Science 284:1523-1527, 1999). PNAG was produced with a wide range of molecular masses that could be divided into three major fractions with average molecular masses of 460 kDa (PNAG-I), 100 kDa (PNAG-II), and 21 kDa (PNAG-III). The purified antigens were not soluble at neutral pH unless first dissolved in 5 M HCl and then neutralized with 5 M NaOH. PNAG-I was very immunogenic in rabbits, but the responses of individual animals were variable. Immunization of mice with various doses (100, 50, or 10 mug) of PNAG-I, -II, and -III demonstrated that only PNAG-I was able to elicit an immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune response with the highest titers obtained with 100-mug dose. When we purified a small fraction of PNAG with a molecular mass of similar to780 kDa (PNAG-780) from PNAG-I, significantly higher IgG titers than those in mice immunized with the same doses of PNAG-I were obtained, suggesting the importance of the molecular mass of PNAG in the antibody response. These results further clarify the chemical structure of PS/A and help to differentiate it from PIA on the basis of immunogenicity, molecular size, and solubility.","Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, Dept Virus & Cell Biol, West Point, PA USA; Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, Dept Bioproc & Bioanalyt Res, West Point, PA USA; Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Channing Lab, Boston, MA USA","Maira-Litran, T (reprint author), Channing Labs, 181 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tmaira@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Pier, Gerald/0000-0002-9112-2331","NIAID NIH HHS [AI 46706, R01 AI046706, R21 AI046706]",,,31,186,192,1,22,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,1098-5522,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

Two types of sintered Ca-P porous ceramic (HA and beta-TCP) and a Ca-P bone cement (CPC were implanted into cavities drilled in rabbit femoral and tibiae condyles. The results have show n that a material biodegradation was rapid in the beta-TCP and the CPC. but very weak in the HA. This biodegradation presented a decrease of material volume from the periphery to the center as well as a particle formation causing phagocytosis by, numerous macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in the CPC. In the beta-TCP, there was a peripheral and central decrease of material volume as well as an absence of particle formation or visible phagocytosis. The process of biodegradation is considered to be directly influenced by the type of material crystallization. The sintered bioceramics processed at a high temperature exhibit good crystallization and are primarily degraded by a process dependent on interstitial liquids. However, the bone cement is formed by physicochemical crystallization and is degraded through a dissolution process associated with a cellular process. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals.

Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG; number average molecular weight of 930, 2860, and 6090) was used to synthesize OPF. A model peptide, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp (GRGD), was incorporated into OPF hydrogels after being coupled to acrylated PEG of molecular weight 3400. The increase of incorporated peptide concentration enhanced MSC attachment to OPF hydrogels of PEG of molecular weight of 930 and 2860. However, the number of attached MSCs to OPF hydrogels of PEG (molecular weight 6090) remained constant regardless of the peptide density. The length of PEG in OPF also influenced cell attachment. When 1 mumole peptide/g hydrogel was incorporated into the OPF hydrogels, the degree of cell attachment at 12 h relative to the initial seeding density was 93.9 +/- 5.9%, 64.7 +/- 8.2%, and 9.3 +/- 6.6% for OPF hydrogels prepared with PEG of molecular weights of 930, 2860, and 6090, respectively. However, the crosslinking density of hydrogels did not significantly affect cell attachment. The interaction was sequence specific, in that MSC attachment to GRGD-modified hydrogels was competitively inhibited when cells were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mM soluble GRGD before cell seeding. These results suggest that we can modulate MSC attachment to OPF hydrogels by altering the peptide density and the molecular structure of OPF hydrogels.

A surface concentration of 59.9 EO wt % is achieved by the solution casting and heat treatment of a film with a bulk concentration of only 3.78 EO wt%. In the aqueous environment, the surface rearrangement of PVC-g-SPEO/PVC blend film is limited and presents a high interfacial energy and high depolar component of interfacial energy due to the ""tail-like"" SPEO side chain. Protein adsorption tests confirm that PVC-g-SPEO/PVC blend films absorb high levels of albumin and dramatically resist fibrinogen adsorption. Surfaces to attract and reversibly bind albumin, which might diminish the occurrence of thrombosis, inflammation, and infection, are developed by self-organizing blends of the amphiphilic comb polymer in poly(vinyl chlorides).

The in vitro test was performed in human osteoblasts, whereas maximal sensitization was performed in 23 Dunkin Hurtley guinea pigs. RKKP bioglaze-coated and uncoated (controls) ZrO2 cylinders were implanted in the distal femoral epiphyses of 14 Sprague-Dawley rats under general anesthesia, and animals were sacrificed at 30 and 60 days. Lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and Thiazolyl Blue (MTT) were tested in vitro. A graded score was used for evaluating the results of the sensitization test. Histomorphometry and microhardness testing were performed to quantity the osseointegration rate, as well as bone quality around the implants. Neither in vitro cytotoxicity nor sensitization were observed. Histomorphometry demonstrated that at 30 days, the affinity index was significantly higher in coated implants than in uncoated ones (1) < 0.05); at 60 days, the behavior of coated implants was better than that of uncoated ones, but differences were not significant. Significant increases in bone microhardness were found at 1000 mu m from the interface area for both uncoated (p < 0.0005) and RKKP bioglaze(R)-coated (p < 0.0005) ZrO2, and also within 200 mu m from the interface (p = 0.014) but only for coated ZrO2, These results suggest that RKKP bioglaze(R)-coated ZrO2, permits biocompatible devices with improved osseointegration properties to be manufactured.

One possible approach is based on growing dermal cells on membranes to obtain appropriate living cellular stroma (sheets) to cover the wound. New membrane-forming copolymers were synthesized, based on acrylonitrile (AN) copolymerization with hydrophilic N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) monomer, in different percentage ratios, such as 5, 20, and 30% w/w, and with two other relatively high polar comonomers-namely, sodium 2-methyl-2-propene-1-sulfonic acid (NaMAS) and aminoethylmethacrylate (AeMA). All these copolymers were characterized for their bulk composition and number average molecular weight, and used to prepare ultrafiltration membranes. Water contact angles and water uptake were estimated to characterize the wettability and scanning force microscopy to visualize the morphology of the resulting polymer surface. Cytotoxicity was estimated according to the international standard regulations, and the materials were found to be nontoxic. The interaction of the membranes with human skin fibroblasts was investigated considering that these cells are among the first to colonize membranes upon implantation or with prolonged external contact. The overall cell morphology, formation of focal adhesion contacts, and cell proliferation were estimated to characterize the cell material interactions. It was found that the pure polyacrylonitrile homopolymer (PAN) membrane provides excellent conditions for seeding with fibroblasts, comparable only to a copolymer containing. AeMA. In contrast, the presence of NaMAS with acidic ionic groups decreased both the attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts. Low content of NVP in the copolymer, LIP to about 5%, still enabled good attachment and spreading of cells, as well as subsequent proliferation of fibroblasts, but higher ratios of 20 and 30% resulted in a significant decrease of these cellular activities.

HyA and type II collagen formed polyion complex (PIC) in aqueous solution due to their opposite electrostatic charges. Therefore, optimal conditions at which PIC was not formed between HyA and type II collagen were determined in order to directly crosslink using a water-soluble carbodiimide [WSC; 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride]. HyA-collagen composite matrices were successfully obtained using WSC in the presence of OAM NaCl, which was found the optimal concentration to suppress PIC formation. Fourier transformed infrared spectra of the obtained matrices showed ester bond formation, indicating that the crosslinking reaction between HyA molecules, HyA and collagen molecules, and collagen molecules proceeded. The swelling ratio of a HyA-collagen composite matrix depended on the WSC concentration and HyA content. From scanning electron microscopy observations, the lyophilized matrices possess multi pore structures. The HyA-collagen composite matrices using this improved method will be useful in the preparation of cartilage regenerative scaffolds, and this methodology may be applied to other polyanion-polycation combinations as well.

To evaluate the force range by which the claw can interact with a substrate, forces generated by the freely moving legs were measured using a load cell force transducer. To obtain information about material properties of the claw, its mechanical strength was tested in a fracture experiment, and the internal structure of the fractured claw material was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The bending stress of the claw was evaluated as 143.4-684.2 MPa, depending on the cross-section model selected. Data from these different approaches led us to propose a model explaining the saturation of friction force with increased texture roughness. The forces are determined by the relative size of the surface roughness R-a (or an average particle diameter) and the diameter of the claw tip. When surface roughness is much bigger than the claw tip diameter, the beetle can grasp surface irregularities and generate a high degree of attachment due to mechanical interlocking with substrate texture. When Ra is lower than or comparable to the claw tip diameter, the frictional properties of the contact between claw and substrate particles play a key role in the generation of the friction force.","Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Div 2, Biol Microtribol Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China","Gorb, SN (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Div 2, Biol Microtribol Grp, Spemannstr 35, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,32,178,199,3,41,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0022-0949,,,J EXP BIOL,J.

After implantation, the host interacts with a biomaterial by forming a conditioning film on its surface and an immune reaction towards the foreign material. When microorganisms can reach the biomaterials surface they can adhere to it. Adhesion of microorganisms to an implant is mediated by their physico-chemical surface properties and the properties of the biomaterials surface itself. Subsequent surface growth of the microorganisms will lead to a mature biofilm and infection, which is difficult to eradicate by antibiotics. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the mechanisms involved in biomaterials centered infection and the possible methods to prevent these infections.

Adhesive proteins adsorbed from serum that is supplemented with the culture medium intercede the initial cell adhesion and subsequent spreading on material surface during culture. Nevertheless, physical and chemical properties of vascular biomaterial surface fluctuate widely between materials resulting in dissimilarity in protein adsorption characteristics. Thus, a variation is expected in cell adhesion, growth and the ability of cell to resist shear stress when tissue engineering on to vascular biomaterials is attempted. This study was carried out with an objective to determine the significance of a matrix coating on cell adhesion and shear stress resistance when cells are cultured on materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) and polyethyleneterephthalate (Dacron), ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium (Ti), that are used for prosthetic devices. The study illustrates the distinction of EC attachment and proliferation between uncoated and matrix-coated surfaces. The cell attachment and proliferation on uncoated UHMWPE and titanium surfaces were not significantly different from matrix-coated surfaces. However, shear stress resistance of the cells grown on composite coated surfaces appeared superior compared to the cells grown on uncoated surface. On uncoated vascular graft materials, the cell adhesion was not supported by serum alone and proliferation was scanty as compared to matrix-coated surface. Therefore, coating of implant devices with a composite of adhesive proteins and growth factors can improve EC attachment and resistance of the cells to the forces of flow.

Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are the metals of choice for endosseous parts of currently available dental implants. Ti-6Al-4V is the most used Ti alloy, however; an improved version, Ti-6Al-7Nb, has been recently developed. Methods: Rat osteoblast-like cells (osteo-1 culture) were used to analyze the biocompatibility of Ti-6Al-7Nb alloy with and without hydroxyapatite (HA) coating. The cells were grown on culture Petri dishes on the top of either plain Ti-6Al-7Nb or HA-coated Ti-6Al-7Nb disks. Osteo-1 cells grown on plain culture dishes were used as controls. Growth and cell viability curves were obtained by scanning electron microscopy. For the growth and viability curves, 10(4) cells were seeded on 35 mm dishes. Cells from each group were counted, in triplicate at 3, 7, 11, and 15 days after seeding using the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Results: The cells grew as multiple layers on both Ti-6Al-7Nb substrates, showing extracellular matrix only when grown on HA-coated Ti-6Al-7Nb disks. The cells grown on HA-coated Ti-6Al-7Nb grew more slowly than the other 2 groups, with significantly smaller cell numbers than control cultures at the end of the experimental time. Additionally, the HA coated Ti-6Al-7Nb group presented smaller percentage of cell viability when compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were observed between the Ti groups. Conclusions: The presence of HA on the Ti-6Al-7Nb surface impaired the cell growth and viability of osteo-1 cells. However, this coating improved the extracellular matrix formation. Thus, our cell viability and structural studies showed that Ti-6Al-7Nb with or without HA coating has relevant physical and biological properties as an implant material.","Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Escola Politecn, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Dent, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Lavos-Valereto, ID (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Escola Politecn, Av Prof Mello Moraes 2463,Cidade Univ, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Deboni, Maria Cristina/G-1859-2010; Azambuja, Nilton/B-6949-2012; Marques, Marcia/F-3780-2012","Deboni, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-2966-6039; Marques, Marcia/0000-0002-9398-1252",,,,30,15,16,0,7,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690 USA",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

The concentrations of hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl and amine groups were analysed with chemical derivatization (CD), using different aldehyde, acetic anhydride, alcohol and hydrazine reagents, and SIMS. Quantification was done by comparing the CD/SIMS results with XPS atomic ratios. Ammonia helical resonator plasma (HRP) treatment was found to incorporate mainly amine and hydroxyl groups on both materials. Argon HRP treatment of PTFE and nitrogen capacitor plate plasma (CPP) treatment of PET were found to increase carboxylic functionalities. The double-bonded oxygen of the ester group of the unmodified PET was attacked and transformed to other groups in the order ammonia plasma > nitrogen HRP > nitrogen CPP, with carbonyl content being reduced to 2.6, 4.1, and 7.6 respectively from 13.5 groups per 100 carbon atoms of the untreated PET. Chemical derivatization greatly helped to distinguish between the functional groups on the plasma-treated surfaces. The difference between the surface specificity of SIMS and XPS has been discussed in the light of these results.

Although the precise mechanisms by which the materials influence osteogenic cells are unclear, it is possible that the materials manipulate the expression of integrins by the cells. We therefore studied the expression of a number of integrins by rat bone marrow (RBM) cells, after culture on culture polystyrene, on machined and grit-blasted titanium, and on calcium phosphate-coated titanium. Integrin expression was studied by FACS analysis. We found a large variation in the expression of integrins by cells in replicate experiments. After culture on polystyrene for 7 days, cells expressed alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, beta1, and beta3, although some of the subunits were expressed only occasionally. The cells did not express the alpha4 subunit. After culture of RBM cells for 8 days on coated and noncoated titanium substrates, cells always expressed alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, and beta1. The alpha1 and beta3 subunits were only expressed in some of the experiments. Frequently, the expression of alpha5, alpha6, and beta1 was higher on the coated than on the noncoated titanium substrates. Based on our results, we conclude that the studied materials are capable of influencing the expression of integrins by RBM cells cultured on relevant implant materials.","Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Coll Dent Sci, Dept Biomat, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Tumorimmunol, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Jansen, JA (reprint author), Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Coll Dent Sci, Dept Biomat, POB 9101, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,"Figdor, Carl/A-4232-2010; Jansen, John/H-8055-2014","Figdor, Carl/0000-0002-2366-9212; Torensma, Ruurd/0000-0002-0555-7903",,,,49,25,25,0,6,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,AUG,2002.0,8,4,,,,,615,626,,10.1089/107632702760240535,,,,12,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,584MR,WOS:000177470800009,12202001.0,,,,2019-02-25

Nowadays, culturing L929 or BALB/3T3 cells in direct contact or in an extract dilution condition is the most frequently using method for evaluating the cytotoxicity from biomaterials and medical devices. However, the results often vary, because it is directly related to the cellular functions and the mechanism of the toxicity of the contacting cells. In this study, 13 cell lines originating from various tissues were used to detect the cytotoxic activities of a PU film containing 0.1% ZDEC (PU-ZDEC). The correlation between. the reactivity zone size and the relative cytotoxicity by quantifying the released total protein from each cell in the direct contact testing method was investigated. Hepa-1c1c7 cells demonstrated the highest sensitivity in the reactivity zone size, while CHO/dhFr(-) cells were the most sensitive in terms of the relative cytotoxicity. A correlation between the two processes in each cell line was not found (r=-0.478). In the extract dilution method, which involved cultivating the cells in the medium with various ZDEC concentrations prepared by diluting the PU incubation, the cytotoxicity increased with increasing ZDEC concentration in all cell lines. The BALB/ 3T3 cells demonstrated the highest sensitivity in the extract dilution method. No correlation in a comparison of the relative cytotoxicity from the direct contact method with the extract dilution method in each cell line, was found (r=-0.445). In this experiment, Hepa-1c1c7, BALB/3T3, CHO/dhFr(-) and L-929 cells among the 13 types of cell lines were the sensitive cell lines according to the two methods. The preliminary results suggest that a comparison of at least one or more cytotoxicity testing methods and many cell lines is necessary for an in vitro cytotoxicity test of biomaterials.","Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, Seoul 120752, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, Seoul, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol, Seoul, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Yonsei Med Technol & Qual Evaluat Ctr, Seoul, South Korea","Kwon, OH (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",,,,,,,17,28,28,1,3,YONSEI UNIV COLLEGE MEDICINE,SEOUL,"C/O KYUN0-IL IM, M.D., PH.D, SHINCHON DONG 134, SEODAEMOON KU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

The molecules, which are termed rodcoil dendrons, consist of a cholesterol moiety that is attached to L-lysine dendrons of three different generations via a biodegradable oligo(L-lactic acid)((n) over bar), spacer. Whereas the molecules exhibit very poor ordering in the dry state, different supramolecular morphologies were observed in the hydrated state. Cholesteryl(L-lactic acid)((23) over bar)-(L-lysine)(G1) and cholesteryl-(L-lactic acid)((23) over bar)-(L-lysine)(G2) self-assemble into lamellar structures with periodicities that depend on degree of hydration. At low degrees of hydration, lamellar ordering was also observed for cholesteryl-(L-lactic acid)((22) over bar)-(L-lysine)(G3). However, at 50 wt %, water steric hindrance in the highly hydrated L-lysine dendrons no longer allows lamellar ordering, and discrete nanosized aggregates are formed. Evidence for the formation of such nanoaggregates was obtained from dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. These rodcoil dendron biomaterials could be of potential interest as temporary molecular scaffolds for cell and tissue engineering.","Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Stupp, SI (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2225 N Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Hartgerink, Jeffrey/G-4275-2016; Stupp, Samuel/B-6737-2009","Hartgerink, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3186-5395; ",,,,33,81,84,2,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 30,2002.0,35,16,,,,,6101,6111,,10.1021/ma011964t,,,,11,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,577YJ,WOS:000177090400009,,,,,2019-02-25

The surface morphologies of all the single crystals, before and after enzymatic degradation by an extracellular PHB depolymerase purified from Alcaligenes faecalis T1, were investigated by the coating of these crystals with polyethylene and observation by transmission electron microscopy. All the single crystals have a lath-shaped morphology with a crystallographic a axis along the long axis of the crystals. The surface regularity of P(3HB) single crystals was dependant on molecular weight. The crystal surfaces of the copolymer single crystals were disordered to a degree which depended on the copolymer composition, and tightly chain-packed crystalline regions in copolymer single crystals reduced by the introduction of secondary monomer units. The surface regularity of the copolymer single crystals responded to the thickness of the crystalline core regions measured by small-angle X-ray scattering. Furthermore, it was revealed that chain-folding regions of copolymer single crystals were embedded under the crystal surfaces which consisted of molecular chains excluded from the crystalline core. It was directly confirmed by the polyethylene-coating method that enzymatic degradation does not progress along the chain-folded regions of the crystal surface.","Riken Inst Phys & Chem Res, Polymer Chem Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Innovat & Engineered Mat, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268502, Japan","Iwata, T (reprint author), Riken Inst Phys & Chem Res, Polymer Chem Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",,"Doi, Yoshiharu/C-3824-2009",,,,,23,24,24,0,8,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1022-1352,,,MACROMOL CHEM PHYSIC,Macromol.

The anatase films consisted of dual layers that were different in topography: a dense inner layer strongly adhered to the Ti substrate and a porous outer layer. In vitro bioactivity of such films was evaluated by soaking them in a simulated body fluid (SBF) of the Kokubo solution to observe their ability to induce apatite deposition. The anatase films with a subsequent thermal treatment at a temperature range of 300-700 degreesC induced apatite deposition within 5 days. Apatite particles were also found to deposit within 7 days on the anatase films being heated at 800 degreesC, which involved much rutile due to direct air oxidation of the titanium substrate. When the heating temperature is lower than 200 degreesC, no apatite deposited on the films even after 10 days of soaking in the SBF solution. The improved in vitro bioactivity of the films subsequently heated over 300 degreesC was attributed to the elimination of fluorine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Porcine small intestine, the source material for the tissue-engineered, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) biomaterial, was evaluated. Relevant enveloped, non-enveloped, and model viruses representative of different virus families were included in the investigation: porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reovirus, murine leukemia retrovirus (LRV), and porcine pseudorabies (herpes) virus (PRV). Samples of small intestine were deliberately inoculated with approximately 1 x 10(7) plaque-forming units (PFU) of virus which were thereafter exposed to a 0.18% peracetic acid/4.8% aqueous ethanol mixture for time periods ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours. Enveloped viruses were more easily inactivated than non-enveloped viruses, but material processed for 30 minutes or longer inactivated all of the viruses. D-10 values were calculated and used to extrapolate the extent of inactivation after 2 hours. Viral titers were reduced by more than 14.0 log(10) PPV, 21.0 log(10) reovirus, 40.0 log(10) PRV, and 27.0 log(10) LRV, meeting international standards for viral sterility. These results demonstrate that treatment of porcine small intestine with a peracetic acid/ethanol solution leads to a virus-free, non-crosslinked biomaterial safe for xeno-transplantation into humans.

The technique is an interfacial two-dimensional analogy of conventional materials testing methodology but is conducted with high spatial resolution and requires the measurement of micro-Newton forces. Here we characterize interfacially adsorbed networks using an elasticity modulus (Et) derived from the gradient of the stress-strain plot at low strain. Measured Et values were of order 200 mN/m at the air-water interface, consistent with a calculated ensemble average estimated using atomic force microscopy derived data on the unfolding of individual protein molecules, Hydrophobic intermolecular interactions were identified as a possible dominant mechanism by which networks transmit force laterally in the interfacial plane. Covalent disulfide linkages did not significantly contribute to network rigidity in these tests, as the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol did not affect force transmission. Networks demonstrated a clear ability for ""repair"" that is dependent on bulk protein concentration and hence the rate of transport into the interfacial region during tensile testing. Importantly, this study suggests that network mechanical response is determined by residual protein tertiary structure and that adsorbed networks should therefore be analyzed as nanostructured biomaterials. The CIT technique complements existing surface rheology approaches for the characterization of interfacial protein networks and advantageously does not require a priori assumptions about network properties and behavior.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge CB2 3RA, England","Middelberg, APJ (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn, Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3RA, England.",,"Middelberg, Anton/B-2434-2013",,,,,42,31,31,0,16,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,JUL 9,2002.0,18,14,,,,,5585,5591,,10.1021/la020090g,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,569XB,WOS:000176627000038,,,,,2019-02-25

It consists of applying a formalism derived from that in the Auger spectroscopy which assumes a linear relationship between the signal intensity emitted by the coating and its thickness. In this paper, a development of the Auger formalism in the case of heterogeneous coatings is presented. Using x-ray energy dispersive spectrometry, this method allows one to determine the atomic concentrations of the elements which composed the coating. The capability of the proposed method is illustrated by two different applications: a Ni-Cu film on titanium alloy substrate (academic specimen) and calcium phosphate film on titanium alloy substrate (prosthetic coating). An iterative procedure established for the proposed method is also presented. The results show that the Auger formalism may now be applied not only to simple coatings for thickness determination but also to the complex ones for concentration determination. And its use does not require the local knowledge of the substrate composition which is not accessible in the Auger spectroscopy.","INSERM, ERM 0203, Electron Microscopy Lab, F-51685 Reims 02, France","Benhayoune, H (reprint author), INSERM, ERM 0203, Electron Microscopy Lab, 21 Rue Clement Ader,BP 138, F-51685 Reims 02, France.",hicham.benhayoune@univ-reims.fr,,,,,,20,8,8,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0022-3727,,,J PHYS D APPL PHYS,J.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays an important role in multiple degenerative processes of cartilage (e. g. osteoarthritis). It is known that matrix provides a trophic signal for the cells and an altered matrix may influence the availability of factors that regulate apoptosis. In this study we investigate the viability of chondrocytes seeded on a Chondrogide(R) scaffold (Geistlich Biomaterials, CH), which we use in matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT). By now, we have studied material from 29 patients treated for localized articular cartilage defects in the knee. Our results indicate that light microscopy (Mayer's hematoxylin-eosin, Masson-Goldner, Trypan-blue and TUNEL method) and electron microscopy can be used to investigate for apoptotic cells grown on a Chondrogide(R) resorbable scaffold. Neither the handling of the cell-matrix biocomposite nor the procedures for fixation could destroy the scaffold or the cell sheet adhering firmly to the matrix. Apoptotic cells were revealed in all samples and with all techniques used. Mayer's hematoxylin-eosin and Masson-Goldner staining show cells with a condensed, pycnotic nucleus and shrunken cytoplasm. In electron microscopy we observed cells with chromatin condensation and volume shrinkage consistent with apoptosis. The results of the Trypan-blue staining show a mean viability of 92.1 +/- 9.8% (range 57-100%). The TUNEL method revealed 44.6 +/- 20.4% positive cells. Our results indicate that apoptosis plays an important role in chondrocytes grown on a scaffold. An optimal scaffold will determine the growth, morphology and phenotype of the chondrocytes by its physical and chemical characteristics.","Med Univ Lubeck, Dept Orthopaed, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; Med Univ Lubeck, Inst Anat, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany","Gille, J (reprint author), Med Univ Lubeck, Dept Orthopaed, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.",,,,,,,27,18,18,0,1,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",0940-9602,,,ANN ANAT,Ann.

The artificial protein contained repeating amino acid sequences based on fibrinogen and anti-thrombin III, comprising an RGD integrin-binding motif, two plasmin degradation sites, and a heparin-binding site. Two-dimensional adhesion studies showed that the artificial protein had specific integrin-binding capability based on the RGD motif contained in its fibrinogen-based sequence. Furthermore, heparin bound strongly to the protein's anti-thrombin III-based region. Protein-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels were plasmin degradable, had Young's moduli up to 3.5 kPa, and supported three-dimensional outgrowth of human fibroblasts. Cell attachment in three dimensions resulted from specific cell-surface integrin binding to the material's RGD sequence.

Biodegradable materials are designed to degrade gradually and be replaced eventually by newly formed tissue in the bode. In this investigation, two particulate bioactive ceramics. i.e.. hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP), were incorporated into polyhydroxybutyrate-polyhydroxyvalerate (PHB-PHV), which is a biodegradable copolymer, to produce new biomaterials for potential medical applications. All raw materials were commercially available and them were characterised prior to composite production. HA PHB PHV and TCP/PHB-PHV composites containing up to 30 vol% of the bioceramics were produced through an established procedure. Compounded and compression moulded materials were evaluated using various techniques including thermogravimatric analysis. scanning electron microscopy. differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. The results showed that intended compositions of composites had been achieved and bioceramic particles were well distributed in the polymer. The degradation temperature of PHB PHV vas significantly reduced by the incorporation of bioceramics. while the melting temperature vas slightly affected by the addition of bioceramics. The crystallinity of PHB PHV was also varied with the presence of HA or TCP particles. The storage Modulus and loss modulus of the composites increased with the increase in HA or TCP content. Composites containing the highest percentage or bioceramics exhibited the highest stiffness. Preliminary in vitro study indicated enhanced ability of the composites to induce the formation of bone-like apatite on their surfaces. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Further work is needed to improve these properties. but changes of the chemical and physical properties will influence its biocompatibility, so the biological attribute of modified chitosan must he evaluated. In this study, the biocompatibility of chitosan modified by several methods was carefully evaluated at the cellular and protein levels using different physical and biological methods. The results provide a theoretical basis for screening biomaterials. We studied the properties of fife kinds of materials made by blending chitosan with different types of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The properties included physical and chemical properties. such as mechanical strength. static contact angle. spectroscopy. thermodynamic attributes and so on. The mechanical properties were slightly improved with the proper amount of PEG, but the improvement was not obvious and was destroyed by the wrong proportion of PEG. Cultures of the cells and amounts and structures of the adsorbed proteins on different materials showed that the PEG effectively improved the biocompatibility of the materials, The PEG enhanced the protein adsorption, cell adhesion, growth and proliferation. but the effects were impaired by excessive PEG. The experiments also demonstrated that the optimum PEG concentration helped to maintain the natural structure of the protein adsorbed on the materials and that maintaining the natural structure benefited cell growth. Analysis of the results based on the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction forces leads to a basic theory for the modification of biomaterials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Indeed. chitosan solutions containing glycerol-2-phosphate (beta-GP) undergo sol-gel transition at a temperature close to 37degreesC, which make them Suitable for the parenteral administration of drugs. However, before using these chitosan derivatives for biomedical applications, it is important to evaluate their biocompatibility, and particularly to test their inflammatory effects. When injected in the hindpaw of the rat, we have shown that: (i) four chitosan beta-GP solutions tested triggered a non-specific response, with solutions prepared with chitosans of higher deacetylation degrees yielding a lesser inflammatory reaction and (ii) systemic pretreatment of animals with icatibant, apafant and diphenhydramine did not significantly diminish this response: dexamethasone practically abolished it for all solutions and ketanserine only slightly decreased it in one preparation at two different times. In conclusion. it appears that a higher degree of deacetylation of the chitin chain is desirable for superior biocompatibility.

Quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an air-liquid interface. S. epidermidis and S. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) muOmega cm. P. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. These results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for TiNOX coatings with a specific resistivity. TiNOX coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of S. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. However, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated TiNOX remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) muOmegacm. This indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the TiNOX coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.

Collagen sponges with uniform pore size (20 mum) were sterilized either with ethylene oxide (EO) or gamma irradiation (2.5 Mrad). Gamma-sterilized sponges showed a dramatic decrease of resistance against enzyme degradation and severe shrinkage after cell seeding. Collapsed porosity inhibited fibroblasts and barred completely the human umbilical vein endothelial cell ingrowth into the sponges. On the contrary, the porous structure and stability of EO-sterilized sponges remained almost unaltered. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells exhibited favorable proliferation and migration within sponges with normal morphology. Tubular formation by seeded endothelial cells occurred early in the first week. Therefore, we emphasize that the impact of sterilization of biomaterials is substantial and any new procedure has to be evaluated by correlating the impact of the procedure on the porous structure with cell proliferation behavior.

Commonly used halogen LCUs have some specific drawbacks such as decreasing light output with time. This may result in a low degree of monomer conversion of the composites with negative clinical implications. Previous studies have shown that blue light emitting diode (LED) LCUs have the potential to polymerize dental composites without having the drawbacks of halogen LCUs. Since these studies were carried out LED technology has advanced significantly and commercial LED LCUs are now becoming available. This study investigates the Barcol hardness as a function of depth, and the compressive strength of dental composites that had been polymerized for 40 or 20s with two high power LED LCU prototypes, a commercial LED LCU, and a commercial halogen LCU. In addition the radiometric properties of the LCUs were characterized. The two high power prototype LED LCUs and the halo-en LCU showed a satisfactory and similar hardness-depth performance whereas the hardness of the materials polymerized with the commercial LED LCU rapidly decreased with sample depth and reduced polymerization time (20 s). There were statistically significant differences in the overall compressive strengths of composites polymerized with different LCUs at the 95% significance level (p = 0.0016) with the two high power LED LCU prototypes and the halogen LCU forming a statistically homogenous group. In conclusion, LED LCU polymerization technology can reach the performance level of halogen LCUs. One of the first commercial LED LCUs however lacked the power reserves of the high power LED LCU prototypes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The produced samples were subjected to compression tests as well as to scanning electron microscopy (SE 4) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. An initial experimental series considered mean polyacrylic acid molecular weights of 2000, 9700,15268 and 64000, keeping a constant SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 2.5. A second experimental series considered SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 2,1; 1,67; 1,25; 0,95 and 0,8; using polyacrylic acid having a constant molecular weight of 64000. The maximum compression strength (82,5 MPa) was achieved for a polyacrylic acid Molecular weight of 64000 and a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio equal to 1. These compression strength values for glass-polyalkenoate cements are similar to those reported for polymethylmetacrylate-based cements, which suggests their potential use in orthopedic applications, Finally, the glass reactivity and the presence of unreacted -COOH functional groups were qualitatively evaluated by FTIR. Phase separation in glasses having SiO2/Al2O3 ratios > I as well as the surface reactivity of the glass particles were qualitatively evaluated by using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX) on the SEM. In order to optimize the compression strength of glass-polyalkenoate cements, future work could be oriented toward the improvement of the glass reactivity, toward the optimization of the polymer/glass ratio and toward the use of nanometric glass particles.","CINVESTAV, Unidad Saltillo, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico; CIQA, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico","Vargas, G (reprint author), CINVESTAV, Unidad Saltillo, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico.",,,"Romero, Jorge/0000-0002-0676-279X",,,,21,1,1,1,4,SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA CERAMICA VIDRIO,MADRID,"ANTIGUA CTRA MADRID-VALENCIA, KM 24,300, ARGANDA DEL REY, 28500 MADRID, SPAIN",0366-3175,,,BOL SOC ESP CERAM V,Bol.

The most prominent feature at the virus surface is a region of the smaller of the two coat proteins (S) which has been extensively used for the insertion of foreign peptides. Given the availability of the three-dimensional structure of the native virus and the amenability of foreign peptide-expressing CPMV chimeras to crystallisation, immunological data can be correlated with the conformational state of the foreign insert. The latter is influenced by proteolysis which occurs within the foreign inserts. In an effort to offer an alternative context for peptide expression, extensive exploration of a second region of the S protein is reported with respect to tolerance to small insertions. Moreover, to make CPMV suitable for a wider spectrum of presentation, a technique was developed to allow surface coupling of a peptide which can serve as the anchoring point for a range of proteins. This new approach is also widely applicable for the direct chemical cross-linking of peptides and full-length protein domains to the viral capsid. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

Error is introduced by tissue compression during measurements or by tissue processing prior to measurement. In the field of valve replacement, tissue dimensional changes from fixation prior to implantation may predispose implants to premature tissue failure and it becomes important to have an accurate method for comparing cusp dimensions pre- and post-fixation. A new approach is to use high-resolution digital radiography to make thickness maps of entire specimens. For 25 matched porcine aortic valve Cusps, We have evaluated this technique's ability to measure and compare thickness. surface area and volume before and after 7 days of aldehyde fixation. Digital radiographs were acquired pre- and post-0.5% glutaraldehyde (n = 13) or 10% formaldehyde (11 = 12) fixation, Mean thickness, surface area, volume and four measurements to evaluate shape differences with fixation were obtained and compared pre- and post-fixation using paired t tests. The results demonstrate that this X-ray imaging technique can provide dimensions of matched fresh and fixed specimens and is sensitive enough to show statistically significant changes due to fixation. These findings also illustrate that aldehyde fixation can cause tissue contraction resulting in a significant overall increase in tissue thickness and a decrease in surface area. This technique could be used to gain further insights into tissue anatomy, and mechanics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We incorporated genotoxic substances like benzo[a]pyrene into the biomaterial Tecoflex, a polyurethane frequently used for catheters and other applications. We demonstrated that the model compound benzo[a]pyrene is sufficiently extracted by organic solvents, whereas cell culture medium only extracts very limited quantities. By changing the medium several times during extraction the extracted amount was augmented. Using higher amounts of organic solvent in relation to the reference material's surface led to a higher recovery of extracted benzo[a]pyrene. For the in vitro genotoxicity testing using the Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test (HPRT test), Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test, and bacterial umu- and SOS-tests, concentration of extracts is a prerequisite because of the low sensitivity of the test systems. Often cytotoxicity interferes with the evaluation of genotoxic effects. We demonstrated that some recommendations of the ISO 10993-Part 3 and 12,(1,2) dealing with the biological evaluation of medical devices, seem to be insufficient, and new rules for the in vitro genotoxicity testing of biomaterials have to be established.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the tissue reaction around implants with different surface topographies. We made coin-shaped silicone and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) implants with double-sided parallel microgrooves (depth 1.0 mum; width 10.0 mum) and random roughness on a micrometer scale. The control implants were smooth. These implants were inserted into subcutaneous pockets created on the flanks of goats. After 1, 3, or 12 weeks, the goats were sacrificed and the implants retrieved and histologically processed. Light microscopic evaluation revealed the formation of fibrous tissue capsules around all implant materials. The PLLA did not visibly degrade during the study period. Histomorphometric analyses were performed on capsule thickness, capsule quality, and on the implant-tissue interface quality. Compared with the silicone implants, the capsules around the PLLA implants shoved significantly better capsule quality Compared to the smooth implants, the capsules around the microgrooved implants were thicker, but the capsules around the roughened implants were thinner. However, randomly roughened implant surfaces generally elicited a stronger and more prolonged inflammatory reaction compared to smooth and microgrooved implant surfaces. We conclude that the application of microgrooves or random surface roughness to polymer implants apparently does not have beneficial effects on peri-implant tissue healing.

Because all of these chemical surface coatings are unstable at extremes of potential, the potential to which the electrode relaxes (between pacing pulses) becomes extremely important. The authors measured this potential for platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) relevant for their use as anode (or cathode) in a bipolar pacing system and from this potential the standard electrode potential, EO was determined. Thirty-Four determinations were made by a null current three-electrade potentiostatic technique of 2.45 mm(2) platinum or gold electrodes implanted chronically in blood perfused muscle in a spontaneously breathing rat. Linear voltage sweeps were performed while monitoring current with voltage at null current determined repeatedly at varying scan rates and limits. Electrode potential varied between -388 +/- 19 mV(vs Ag/Ag+) for platinum and -388 +/- 55 mV for gold electrodes. Hysteresis was observed in all sweeps (P < 0.008, Fisher's exact) and measured 61 +/- 17 mV (anodic) and 25 +/- 3 mV (cathodic) with steep dependence on polarity (P < 0.001, t-test). The findings were independent of the materials' electronic work functions Edegrees versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) were thus -166 mV(platinum) and -166 mV(gold). Because the most common bipolarsystem uses platinum as anode, these results are directly applicable to current pacing technology. Provided low thresholds are achievable with novel surface modified electrodes, the small range of variation of Edegrees, and the particular mean value observed, are both compatible with function, provided care is used during electrode testing to avoid surface disruption. These results are significant also for biosensors that use similar surface modification methodologies.","Univ Illinois, Heart Inst Children, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Hope Childrens Hosp, Heart Inst Children, Oak Lawn, IL USA; Long Isl Jewish Med Ctr, Pediat Res Ctr, New Hyde Pk, NY 11042 USA; Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA","Ovadia, M (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Heart Inst Children, 840 S Wood St,M-C 856, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",,,,,,,29,3,3,0,0,FUTURA PUBL CO,ARMONK,"135 BEDFORD RD, PO BOX 418, ARMONK, NY 10504-0418 USA",0147-8389,,,PACE,PACE-Pacing Clin.

In all patients, the implant was used for recontouring and augmenting the cranial vault. Seven of 15 patients had a direct communication between sinus mucosa and the implant at the time of surgery. Three of the seven patients developed late postoperative inflammatory reactions of the surgical site with delamination of the implant. Each patient required an aggressive irrigation and debridement with removal of the delaminated hydroxyapatite. Pathologic findings showed evidence of a foreign body inflammatory reaction in the tissue, and mixed bacterial flora were identified in all specimens. No late problems with the cement were seen in patients without a communication to the sinuses. Our findings suggest that the use of BoneSource, an essentially nonviable, non-vascularized implant, in areas exposed to bacterial contamination is contraindicated in the pediatric population. BoneSource and other similar hydroxyapatite biomaterials do have a role as implants in the craniofacial skeleton. The indications and contraindications of these substances will need to be further defined for wide acceptance to occur.","Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Div Plast Surg, Craniofacial Program, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; St Michaels Hosp, Div Plast Surg, Craniofacial Program, Toronto, ON, Canada","Matic, D (reprint author), London Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Plast Surg, Victoria Campus,Westminster Site,Room D122,800 Co, London, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,26,60,60,0,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0032-1052,,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

The microfabrication processes are excimer laser etching and microetching, the latter being divided into microlithography and Ar+ ion etching. Channels were fabricated in each material. It was found that, using the equipment available, excimer laser etching could not achieve the specifications whereas microlithography could. How these conclusions were reached is described in detail.

Polyimide sieve electrodes were placed in silicone chambers and implanted between the severed ends of the sciatic nerve in rats, The sieve part had 281 round via holes of 40 mum in diameter, with nine integrated recording-stimulating electrodes arranged around the via holes. The degree of axonal regeneration was examined at 2, 7, and 12 months postimplantation (mpi). Regeneration was successful in 12 of the13 animals implanted. Reinnervation of distal muscle and nerves increased with time, reaching a plateau about 7 mpi. The number of myelinated fibers increased from 2 to 7 months, at which time it was similar to control values. With time the myelinated fibers matured, with significant increases in axon diameter and myelin thickness. Only 0.6% of the regenerated axons showed evidence of compression near the implanted electrode. The majority of the myelinated fibers that crossed the via holes and had been regenerated through the distal nerve had a normal appearance. Sieve electrodes were useful for nerve stimulation at postimplantation. Stimulation through different active electrodes excited nerve bundles, evoking compound muscle action potentials of varying shape and amplitude, indicative of selective axonal stimulation.

These inserts allow the cell layer to be in contact with the material to be tested on the apical side and with the nutrient medium on the basal side. The materials tested were silicone oil, the perfluorocarbons perfluorophenanthrene and perfluoroctane, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Perfluorophenanthrene, the heaviest of the compounds, induced a very precocious detachment of the cell layer. All the other tested biomaterials were compatible with cell survival and did not alter the structural organization of the retinal cultures, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. By immunocytochemical techniques we evaluated the cell composition and the differentiation state of each of the cultures. In both control and treated samples, neuronal cells were well preserved. The expression of microtubule-associated protein 2, a marker of differentiated neuronal cytoskeleton, was not affected. Amacrine neurons, immunolabeled for gamma-aminobutyric acid, still were detectable after treatment. Synapses, marked by immunoreactivity for synapthophysin, were equally preserved. Vimentin-positive glial cells did not show modifications. The apoptotic rate, as determined by the terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling assay, was similar in treated and control samples. The results confirm that the use of biomaterials with a specific gravity close to intraocular fluids is compatible with retinal cell survival and differentiation in vitro.

In this study, semi-empirical molecular modeling was used along with experimental wetting data to theoretically approach protein adsorption at this primary structural level. Changes in enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy were calculated as a function of residue-surface separation distance for the adsorption of individual hydrophobic peptide residues (valine, leucine, phenylalanine) on alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers on gold [Au-S(CH2)(15)-X; X = CH3, OH, NH3+ COO-]. The results predict that the adsorption of each type of hydrophobic residue is energetically favorable and entropy dominated on a methyl-terminated hydrophobic surface, energetically unfavorable and enthalpy dominated on a hydroxyl-terminated neutral hydrophilic surface, and very slightly favorable to unfavorable and enthalpy dominated on charged surfaces. These theoretical results provide a basis for understanding some of the fundamental effects governing protein adsorption to synthetic surfaces. This level of understanding is needed for the proactive design of surfaces to control protein adsorption and subsequent cellular response for both implant and tissue engineering applications.

Polyelectrolyte films were built up with different terminating layers on which SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cells and human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells were grown. The terminating layer was made of one of the following polyelectrolytes: poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA), or poly(L-lysine) (PLL). Cell adherence, viability, stability of osteoblast phenotype, and inflammatory response were studied. Adherence and viability were good on all terminating layers except the PEI-terminating layer, which was cytotoxic. Maintenance of osteoblast phenotype marker expression was observed on PSS- and PGA-terminating films for both cell types, whereas downregulation, associated with the induction of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion, was detected on PEI and PAH for both cell types and on PLL for PDL cells. These results suggested a good biocompatibility of PSS- and PGA-ending films for PDL cells and of PSS-, PGA-, and PLL-terminating films for SaOS-2 cells. As a result, polyelectrolyte multilayer films could emerge as new alternatives for implant coatings.

The cell viability was investigated using calcein and ethidium staining. Following exposure to PE particulate, the morphology of the human MDMs was heterogeneous: rounded, flattened, and elongated. There was no morphological evidence of cytotoxicity or apoptosis. The MDM viability was not influenced by phagocytosis of PE particulate in a negative fashion.

The interactions between the biomolecule and the inorganic, organic or hybrid nanocomposite material determines the degree to which the biomolecule retains its native properties, and such interactions can be tuned to provide optimised biomaterials that are suitable for a variety of applications. Typical applications of sol-gel derived biomaterials include selective coatings for optical and electrochemical biosensors, stationary phases for affinity chromatography, immunoadsorbent and solid-phase extraction materials, controlled release agents, solid-phase biosynthesis, and unique matrices for biophysical studies. Through careful selection of precursors and additives, these materials can be designed for specific applications, and can produce useful, robust devices with good analytical parameters of merit. Indeed, current advances in the development of nanocomposite and mesostructured materials suggest that major improvements in bioimmobilisation are on the horizon, and should result in substantial improvements in bioanalytical devices over the next decade.

Among them, Fg is thought to play a leading role in mediating platelet adhesion to plasma-preadsorbed biomaterials, but this has been established for only three types of materials so far in our laboratory. Furthermore, the role of Fn, Vn, and vWF in mediating platelet adhesion to plasma-preadsorbed surfaces is still unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess the importance of Fg, Fn, Vn, and vWF in mediating platelet adhesion to a series of polystyrene-based surfaces. The strategy applied in the present investigation was to compare platelet adhesion to surfaces preadsorbed with normal plasma, plasma selectively depleted in Fn or Vn or both Fn and Vn, plasma from donors who were genetically deficient in vWF, and serum. Few platelets adhered to the surfaces preadsorbed with serum, whereas depletion of Fn, Vn, or vWF from plasma did not decrease platelet adhesion significantly. Replenishment of exogenous Fg to serum before protein adsorption restored platelet adhesion to the surfaces, suggesting that Fg was the major plasma protein that mediated platelet adhesion. Also, we found that a surface density of adsorbed Fg far below the amount that usually adsorbs to synthetic surfaces was sufficient to support full-scale platelet adhesion.

The present study reports on the synthesis and osteoblast-adhesive properties of peptides carrying RGD motifs and of sequences mapped on human vitronectin. Our data suggest that osteoblast adhesion on polystyrene plates modified with a linear peptide, in which the GRGDSP sequence is repeated four times, was significantly higher when compared to the adhesion obtained using branched peptides, interestingly containing the same motif. Osteoblast adhesion assays on acellular bone matrix using this active peptide gave very promising results. We also demonstrated that a novel peptide, carrying the X-B-B-B-X-B-B-X motif (where B is a basic amino acid and X is a nonbasic residue), promotes proteoglycan-mediated osteoblast adhesion more efficiently with respect to the KRSR sequence that was recently proposed as heparan-sulfate binding peptide.

In this study we have investigated how surface chemistry and adsorbed proteins can modulate monocyte and macrophage adhesion, IL-13-induced foreign-body giant cell formation, and apoptosis in vitro. Compared to a dimethylsilane-modified surface (DM), a surface modified with RGD peptides had no effect on adhesion density, foreign-body giant cell (FBGC) formation, or apoptosis in non-depleted serum conditions. The depletion of specific adhesive proteins affected adhesion, FBGC formation, and apoptosis. While the depletion of fibronectin and vitronectin had no overall effect compared to nondepleted serum conditions, the depletion of IgG from serum caused a significant decrease in initial adherent cell density [1000 +/- 200 compared to 2460 +/- 590 (p = 0.02)], a significant decrease in FBGC formation [2% compared to 17% (p = 0.02)], and a significant increase in the level of apoptosis [57% compared to 32% (p = 0.01)] on DM. The lowered initial adherent cell density on DM was not observed on the RGD surface, indicating that the RGD surface promotes increased initial adhesion. However, the RGD surface does not affect FBGC formation (i.e., macrophage fusion) or levels of apoptosis, which remained comparable to those on the DM surfaces at days 7 and 10.

PEG-600-penetrated ePTFE membranes were dried in a vacuum to immediately remove ethanol, then treated with APG at 20 kHz and 60-70 W for 15 min and thoroughly washed with ethanol and water. PEG-600-modified ePTFE membranes were analyzed using contact angle measurement, Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ePTFE membrane contact angles were reduced after PEG-600 plasma treatment. FTIR-ATR spectra showed an absorption band due to a PEG hydroxyl group (-OH). SEM showed that ePTFE fiber surfaces were uniformly immobilized with PEG-600 and retained their porous structure, A general biological evaluation of the PEG-modified ePTFE membranes showed no cytotoxicity on CHO-K1 cell lines and no hemolytic action. Albumin adsorption on the PEG-modified ePTFE membranes increased with increasing PEG-600 deposited on ePTFE membranes. Fibrinogen adsorption decreased with increasing PEG-600 deposited on ePTFE membranes. gamma-Globulin adsorption did not change before or after PEG plasma modification. 1% and 3% PEG-600 plasma-treated ePTFE only slightly increased platelet adhesion, but adhering platelets evidenced no pseudopod formation. 5% PEG-600-modified ePTFE showed relatively large numbers of platelet adhesion. We concluded that 3% PEG-600-modified ePTFE membrane had the best physical properties and biological compatibility, indicating 3%.

Here we present data on peptides designed to adsorb from aqueous solutions onto highly porous hydrophobic surfaces with specific helical secondary structures. Small linear peptides composed of alternating leucine and lysine residues were synthesized, and their adsorption onto porous polystyrene surfaces was studied using a combination of solid-state NMR techniques. Using conventional solid-state NMR experiments and newly developed double-quantum techniques, their helical structure was verified. Large-amplitude dynamics on the NMR time scale were not observed, suggesting irreversible adsorption of the peptides. Their association, adsorption, and structure were examined as a function of helix length and sequence periodicity, and it was found that, at higher solution concentrations, peptides as short as seven amino acids adsorb with defined secondary structures. Two-dimensional double-quantum experiments using C-13-enriched peptide sequences allow high-resolution determination of secondary structure in heterogeneous environments where the peptides are a minor component of the material. These results shed light on how polymeric surfaces may be surface-modified by structured peptides and demonstrate the level of molecular structural and dynamic information solid-state NMR can provide.","Univ Washington, Dept Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Drobny, GP (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DE 12554],,,43,48,49,1,26,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Here we report an initial investigation of the in vitro antibacterial properties of AgBG, a novel bioactive glass composition doped with Ag2O. The bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of this new material and of two other bioactive glass compositions, 45S5 Bioglass and BG, have been studied by using Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. Concentrations of AgBG in the range of 0.05 to 0.20 mg of AgBG per ml of culture medium were found to inhibit the growth of these bacteria. Not only was AgBG bacteriostatic, but it also elicited a rapid bactericidal action. A complete bactericidal effect was elicited within the first hours of incubation at AgBG concentrations of 10 mg ml(-1). 45S5 Bioglass and BG had no effect on bacterial growth or viability. The antibacterial action of AgBG is attributed exclusively to the leaching of Ag+ ions from the glass matrix. Analytical measurements rule out any contribution to AgBG-mediated bacterial killing by changes in pH or ionic strength or the dissolution of other ionic species from the biomaterials. Our observations of the dissolution profiles of Ag+ from AgBG in the presence and absence of bacteria are consistent with silver accumulation by the bacteria.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Mat, London SW7 2AZ, England","Williams, HD (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Imperial Coll Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.",h.d.williams@ic.ac.uk,,"Williams, Huw/0000-0003-2225-6413",,,,34,243,254,0,58,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0066-4804,1098-6596,,ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH,Antimicrob.

In this study, the ability of apo-Tf to suppress the adhesion of two other strains of bacteria, namely a Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and a Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa to several biomaterials, including polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, and silicone, is documented. The presence of apo-Tf in the medium at 20 mug/ml lowered bacterial adhesion to all tested biomaterials more than fourfold. Moreover, apo-Tf exerted its inhibitory activity even when protein coated surfaces were used as substrates for bacterial adhesion. To emphasize the importance of apo-Tf in the prevention of bacterial adhesion, human serum was depleted of Tf, employing affinity chromatography, and was shown to lose its inhibitory activity toward bacterial adhesion. Upon addition of apo-Tf to Tf-depleted serum, the activity was reestablished, resulting in a marked reduction in the number of bacteria adhered to the surfaces. Following the enzymatic deglycosylation, apo-Tf retained its ability to prevent bacterial adhesion. These results indicate that the carbohydrate moiety does not seem to play a role in this activity. The presented data provide the evidence that the inhibitory activity of apo-Tf is not bacterial strain specific and that the presence of apo-Tf in the medium results in a significant reduction of bacterial adhesion to a variety of neat and/or protein coated surfaces.","Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Pathol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Burns, GL (reprint author), Utah Artificial Heart Inst, 803 North 300 West,Suite 180, Salt Lake City, UT 84103 USA.",,,,,,,33,26,26,1,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

These adhesion molecules act as mediators of cell adhesion, play a role in the modulation Of Cell adhesion on biomaterials and therefore condition the response of tissues to implants, First and second passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured on plasma treated and untreated PET and PTFE. HUVECs grown on polystyrene tissue Culture coverslips and HUVECs stimulated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were used as controls. After 1 day and 7 days, the expression of adhesion molecules platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Integrin alpha(v)beta(3), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, P-selectin and L-selectin were evaluated using Row cytometry and immunohistochemistry. There was a slight increase in positive cell numbers expressing the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on plasma treated PET and PTFE. A significant increase in E-selectin positive cells on untreated PTFE was demonstrated after 7 days. Stimulation with TNF-alpha demonstrated a significant increase in the proportion of ICAM-1. VCAM-1 and E-selectin positive cells. Almost all cells expressed PECAM-1 and integrin alpha(v)beta(3) On both materials and controls but did not express P- and L-selectin on any surface. When second passage cells were used, the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was markedly increased on all surfaces but not with TNF-alpha. These significant differences were not observed in other adhesion molecules. These results were supported by immunohistochemical Studies. The effects of plasma treated PET and PTFE on cell adhesion and proliferation was also studied. There was a 1.3-fold increase in cell numbers adhered on ammonia plasma treated PET compared to untreated PET and a 5.5-fold increase in cell numbers on treated PTFE compared to untreated PTFE after 1 day. This is significantly different when analysed statistically. After 7 days, cell number increased significantly on all surfaces compared to I day, except for untreated PTFE which conversely reduced by 41%. Cell number on the surface of untreated PET was no different to treated PET on days 1 and 7 when second passage cells were used. The study has shown that the plasma treatment of PET and PTFE with ammonia improves the adhesion and growth of endothelial cells and slightly upregulates the expression of adhesion molecules. This surface modification should promote colonisation of an artificial vascular prosthesis by endothelial cells and make it less vulnerable to immune system cells of the recipient. In addition, it should be considered which passage of cells is used due to the different adhesion features of different passages of HUVECs on untreated PET.

Moreover, screening techniques that will allow various materials to be recommended, or otherwise, for further testing, have the potential to make appreciable savings in the time and expense associated with product development. This paper gives details of a novel whole blood chemiluminescence method, based on the photoprotein Pholasin(R), which emits light in the presence of the free radical superoxide, other reactive oxygen species and the enzyme myeloperoxidase. This whole blood assay may have the potential as a screening method for assessing calcium phosphate (Ca-P) bioceramic powders according to their relative bioactivity. The method employed involves exposure of samples of anti-coagulated (heparinised) blood to the various Ca-P materials and stimulating the contacted leukocytes in the blood with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). PMA stimulates protein kinase C directly and sets in motion a cascade of events in the leukocytes leading to the activation of the superoxide generating NADPH oxidase system. PMA also promotes degranulation, which is the fusion of the granule membrane with the plasma membrane and the extracellular release of granule enzymes. Changes in the free radical and degranulation activity of the cells. as measured by the luminescent response of Pholasin(R) to cells stimulated with PMA, after exposure to the Ca-P powders, are presented as percentage differences from the response to (control) blood samples not exposed to the powders. The resultant data clearly indicate significant differences in the light detected via Pholasin(R) from the blood exposed to the bioceramic materials compared to that from the relevant controls. These differences correlate well with the ascribed bioactivity of the Ca-P powders, as assigned from the measured chemical and structural properties. Furthermore, the method can also be applied to samples of blood, which have been diluted in the ratio 1:100 in standard blood dilution buffer. The light output response in the diluted blood experiments is exactly the same as that observed with undiluted whole blood but occurs immediately as compared to the many minutes required to give response in the latter case.

However, delayed fracture of titanium dental implants has been reported, and factors affecting the acceleration of corrosion and fatigue have to be determined. The fractured surface of a retrieved titanium screw and metallurgical structures of a dental implant system were analyzed. The outer surface of the retrieved screw had a structure different from that of the as-received screw. It was confirmed that a shear crack initiated at the root of the thread and propagated into the inner section of the screw. Gas chromatography revealed that the retrieved screw had absorbed a higher amount of hydrogen than the as-received sample. The grain structure of a titanium screw, immersed in a solution known to induce hydrogen absorption, showed features similar to those of the retrieved screw. It was concluded that titanium in a biological environment absorbs hydrogen and this may be the reason for delayed fracture of a titanium implant.

Two of them, one made of polyetherimide (PEI), and a second based on polyacrylonitrile-N-vinylpyrollidone co-polymer (P(AN-NVP)), were recently developed in our lab and studied for the first time. Together with pure polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes, the three preparations were characterised as ultra-filtration membranes. Their ability to support cell attachment, morphology, proliferation and function of human hepatoblastoma C3A cells was studied. The role of surface morphology for the interaction with hepatocytes was highlighted using a commercial, moderately wettable polyvinylidendifluoride (PVDF) membrane with micro-filtration properties. Comparative investigations showed strongest interaction of C3A cells with PAN membranes, as the focal adhesion contacts were more expressed and cell growth was also high. However, the functional activity in terms of albumin synthesis was reduced. Very similar results were obtained with the most hydrophobic PEI membrane. In contrast, the most hydrophilic membrane P(AN-NVP) was found to provoke stronger homotypic adhesion (E-cadherin expression) of C3A cells and less substratum attachment (focal adhesions). but enhanced albumin secretion. However, proliferation of C3A cells was lowered. Micro-porous PVDF membrane showed very good initial attachment, but the resulting cell material and cell-cell interaction were relatively poor developed. Among four membranes tested, PEI seems to be the most attractive membrane for biohybrid liver devices, as it provides good surface properties for hepatocytes interaction, but in addition it is highly thermostable, which would permit steam sterilisation. No simple relationship, however, between the wettability of the membranes and their ability to support hepatocyte adhesion and function was found in this study.

Using magnetron sputtering and thermal oxidation, titanium oxide thin films containing tantalum, Ti(Ta+5)O-2, are fabricated to meet the challenge of enhanced hemocompatibility. The blood compatibility is evaluated in vitro by clotting time and platelet adhesion measurement, and in vivo experiments are also conducted. The Ti(Ta+5)O-2 films exhibit attractive blood compatibility exceeding that of low isotropic pyrolytic carbon. Physical properties such as surface energy and semiconductivity are found to play important roles. Our calculated results reveal that the smaller surface force gamma(s) of the film and the smaller blood/film interfacial tension gamma(c.blood) are partially responsible for the enhancement of the blood compatibility. Based on the optical bandgap model, the film possesses better hemocompatibility because its optical bandgap of 3.2 eV is wider than that of fibrinogen having a bandgap of 1.8 eV. These factors result in thinner protein layers on the film surface, less protein denaturing, and overall excellent antithrombogenic properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, to date, replication of trabecular bone structure and mechanical competence has proved elusive. Maximization of bone tissue attachment to replacement materials requires a highly organized porous structure for tissue integration and a template for assembly, combined with structural properties analogous to living bone. Natural structural biomaterials provide an abundant source of novel bone replacements. Animal skeletons have been designed through optimization by natural selection to physically support and physiologically maintain diverse tissue types encompassing a variety of functions. These skeletons possess structural properties that provide support for the complete reconstruction and regeneration of ectodermal, mesodermal, and bone tissues derived from animal and human and are thus suited to a diversity of tissue engineering applications. Increased understanding of biomineralization has initiated developments in biomimetic synthesis with the generation of synthetic biomimetic materials fabricated according to biological principles and processes of self-assembly and self-organization. The synthesis of complex inorganic forms, which mimic natural structures, offers exciting avenues for the chemical construction of macrostructures and a new generation of biologically and structurally related bone analogs for tissue engineering.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the composition of the deposits was similar to that of the magnetron-sputtering targets. X-ray diffraction revealed an amorphous structure of the sputtered deposits, while the casting alloys had a crystalline structure. The polarization resistance of sputtered alloys in NaCl solution was higher than the activity of conventional alloys, which implied a superior corrosion resistance of the sputtered deposits. Corrosion was initiated by supplying oxygen gas into a wet argon atmosphere and the QCM detected corrosion with nanogram resolution as the increase in mass. Corrosion currents were calculated from the mass versus time curves. The QCM appeared to be an effective tool for corrosive characterization of sputtered alloys in gaseous environments.

Four isogenic E. faecalis strains with and without aggregation substances and one strain expressing enterococcall surface protein were used. The kinetics of enterococcal adhesion to the materials was measured in situ in a parallel plate flow chamber. initial deposition rates were similar for all strains, whereas the presence of surface proteins increased the total number of adhering bacteria. Nearest neighbour analysis demonstrated that enterococci expressing the whole sex-pheromone plasmid encoding aggregation substances 1 or 373 adhered in higher numbers through mechanisms of positive cooperativity, which means that adhesion of bacteria enhances the probability of adhesion of other bacteria near these bacteria. Enterococcii with the enterococcal surface protein did not adhere through this mechanism.

However, for some applications, they are limited by their inferior mechanical properties and unsatisfactory compatibility with cells and tissues. A strong, biodegradable, and biocompatible elastomer could be useful for fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and in vivo sensing. We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tough biodegradable elastomer from biocompatible monomers. This elastomer forms a covalently crosslinked, three-dimensional network of random coils with hydroxyl groups attached to its backbone. Both crosslinking and the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups likely contribute to the unique properties of the elastomer. In vitro and in vivo studies show that the polymer has good biocompatibility. Polymer implants under animal skin are absorbed completely within 60 days with restoration of the implantation sites to their normal architecture.","MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Div Comparat Med, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Langer, R (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Ameer, Guillermo/B-6765-2009","Wang, Yadong/0000-0003-2067-382X",NHLBI NIH HHS [5-R01-HL60435],,,45,682,707,31,352,NATURE AMERICA INC,NEW YORK,"345 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1707 USA",1087-0156,,,NAT BIOTECHNOL,Nat.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a frequent cause of mortality in intensive care patients. This study describes the physicochemical properties of hexetidine-impregnated poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) endotracheal tube (ET) biomaterials and their resistance to microbial adherence (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Methods. PVC emulsion was cured in the presence of hexetidine (0-20% w/w) and was characterized in terms of drug release, surface properties (i.e., microrugosity/contact angle), mechanical (tensile) properties, and resistance to microbial adherence. Results. Under sink conditions, hexetidine release from PVC was diffusion-controlled. Increasing the concentration of hexetidine from 1% to 10% (w/w) (but not from 10% to 20% w/w) increased the subsequent rate of drug release. In general, increasing the concentration of hexetidine decreased both the tensile properties and hydrophobicity, yet increased PVC microrugosity. Following hexetidine release (21 days), the surface properties were similar to those of native PVC. The resistance of hexetidine-containing PVC (1% or 5%) to microbial adherence (following defined periods of drug release) was greater than that of native PVC and was constant over the examined period of hexetidine release. Conclusions. ET PVC containing 1% (w/w) hexetidine offered an appropriate balance between suitable physicochemical properties and resistance to microbial adherence. This may offer an approach with which to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.","Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Med Devices Unit, Sch Pharm, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Jones, DS (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Med Devices Unit, Sch Pharm, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,,,,,30,29,29,3,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,,,PHARMACEUT RES,Pharm.

The optimal polycondensation temperature was between 10 and 20 degreesC. We also obtained copolymers of succinylsarcosine and succinylisoleucine by the same method. When the succinylisoleucine content increased, the obtained polyamides showed lower melting points, higher enzymatic degradability, and higher cell adhesion rates. Thermally responsive polyamides containing an elastin-derived pentapeptide, VPGVG, succinylsarcosine, and succinylisoleucine were obtained by the same method.

Implant retention of rhBMP-2 by the biomaterial carrier is important for the osteoinductive activity. To control in situ retention of rhBMP-2, thermoreversible polymers were synthesized and characterized, and their compatibility with rhBMP-2-induced osteoinduction was investigated. The results indicated that polymers with a controlled ""solubility <-> insolubility"" transition temperature could be prepared from N-isopropylacrylamide, ethylmethacrylate, and N-acryloxysuccinimide (NASI). NASI-containing polymers were able to conjugate to rhBMP-2 without additional cross-linkers. Implantation in the rat ectopic model, where alkaline phosphatase and calcium deposition were utilized as markers of osteoinductive activity, indicated that rhBMP-2 mixed with the polymers were effective for osteoinduction. Moreover, rhBMP-2 conjugated to the chosen polymers was as effective as native rhBMP-2 in inducing ALP activity and calcium deposition. We conclude that thermoreversible polymers are compatible with rhBMP-2-induced osteogenesis and can serve as novel biomaterials for rhBMP-2 delivery.","Univ Alberta, Fac Engn, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G6, Canada; Genet Inst Inc, Andover, MA USA; Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Surg, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Uludag, H (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Fac Engn, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, 526 Chem & Mat Engn Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G6, Canada.",,,,,,,22,21,21,0,2,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,JUN,2002.0,8,3,,,,,429,440,,10.1089/107632702760184691,,,,12,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,570UW,WOS:000176677800008,12167229.0,,,,2019-02-25

Using X-ray spectroscopy techniques, such as the X-ray scanning analytical microscope (XSAM), enables the mapping of elements with simultaneous structural imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this microscopy technique to analyze tissue-engineered samples. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), a rapid prototyping technology, was used to fabricate 3-D scaffolds made of polycaprolactone (PCL)-hydroxylapatite (HA) (90/10 wt.%). The scaffolds had a regular architecture and the honeycomb-like pores were fully interconnected with a total matrix porosity of 70%. Biopsies of human calvarial corticocancellous bone were harvested and a primary explant system of the morcellized grafts was established within the PCL-HA constructs. Tissue constructs were cultured in vitro for 3 weeks and then implanted into the back of Balb C nude mice. Grafts were explanted after 17 weeks and tissue formation was assessed via XSAM and CT scan and histology. Outgrowth from osteoblasts from the bone chips started after 2 weeks in culture, with cells migrating radially into the composite constructs. Osteocalcin levels showed an increasing tendency during the 3-week culture period. After 17 weeks in vivo, areas of ectopic bone formation could be detected throughout the whole construct, compared to the control implants where only fibrous tissue formation was present. In the XSAM, calcium- and phosphorus-enriched bands presented a relatively even distribution with some dense spots. Quantitative elemental analysis revealed an average X-ray intensity of 131 cps for calcium in a mapped area of 2 mm(2). Trichrome Goldner staining showed good vascularization as well as irregular osteoid formation and mineralization of the newly formed woven bone-like tissue. In this study, we were able to show that the XSAM is a useful analytical technique which enabled us to trace elements simultaneously and provides structural image with mapping information in tissue-engineered samples.

After their production, the mechanical properties of these scaffolds were tested, presenting a compressive modulus of 124.6 +/- 27.2 MPa and a compressive strength of 8.0 +/- 0.9 MPa. These values are within the best found in the literature and show that by using this technique, it is possible to produce scaffolds that, from a mechanical standpoint, may be suitable for bone tissue engineering.

HA/PHB composite containing 10, 20, and 30 vol.% of HA was made for in vitro evaluation. In vitro studies were conducted using an acellular simulated body fluid (SBF). Composite specimens were immersed in SBF at 37 degreesC for various periods of time prior to surface analysis and mechanical testing. Results obtained from scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination, thin film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that a layer of bone-like apatite formed within a short period on HA/PHB composite after its immersion in SBF, demonstrating high in vitro bioactivity of the composite. The bioactivity and mechanical properties of the composite could be changed by varying the amount of HA in the composite. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed that the storage modulus (E') of HA/PHB composite increased initially with immersion time in SBF, due to apatite formation on composite surface and decreased after prolonged immersion in SBF, indicating degradation of the composite in a simulated body environment. HA/PHB composite thus has the potential for its intended applications.

The EAM and UC adduct contain nearly equal amounts of PVP while the DRM adduct has lower amounts. Higher molecular weight PVP favored greater PVP content in the adducts regardless of the method of preparation. DSC thermograms, and FTIR and CD spectra of the three ducts in the solid state revealed that PVP and PGNA are intimately mixed and the PGNA is in a random conformation. Hydrophobic interactions between PGNA and PVP are evident in dilute aqueous solutions of all three adducts while Na+ ions of PGNA remain as free ions. 2D NOESY H-1 NMR spectra of the EAM and UC adducts are very similar and show a strong correlation between the a proton of PGNA with a pyrroli done ring (no 3 and no 4 protons) and beta protons of PGNA with a pyrrolidone ring (no 5 proton). In contrast, regarding the DRM adduct, only the a-proton of PGNA interacts with the pyrrolidone ring (no 3 and no. 4 protons), presumable due to the orientation of the pyrrolidone ring at the organic phase water interface of the reverse micelle which causes the proton in position 5 of the ring to be buried in the organic phase. All three adducts dissociate in water to form free PVP and PGNA. However, the DRM adduct dissociates faster than other two presumable due to reduced hydrophobic interactions. Differences in composition and properties observed for the non-covalent adducts may be attributed to the differences in intermolecular (hydrophobic) interactions imposed on the two components, PGNA and PVP, during each method of preparation.","Clark Atlanta Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA","Khan, IM (reprint author), Clark Atlanta Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA.",,,,,,,29,3,3,0,4,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1616-5187,,,MACROMOL BIOSCI,Macromol.

The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14), the elastic constant s(55), and the dielectric permittivity epsilon(11) were measured for the anionic collagen and collagen-HA films. For the collagen-HA composite film (Col-HACOM) the main peaks associated to the crystalline HA is present. For the nanocrystalline composite, nanometric HA powder (103 nm particle size) (HAN), obtained by mechanical milling were used. For the composite film (Col-HAN) the HA and CaH(PO4)(2)H2O phases were detected. One can see that the HA powder (HAN) present the main peaks associated to crystalline HA. The IR spectroscopy measurements on HA-COM and HAN powders, Col-HACOM and Col-HAN composite films and collagen film (Col) presents the main resonances associated to the modes of (PO4)(3)-, (CO3)(2)-. The IR spectra of Collagen Film (Col) shows the bands associated to amide I (C=O), amide II (N-H) and amide III (C-N) vibrational modes. The scanning electron photomicrography of the Col-HACOM and Col-HAN films, respectively, shows deposits of HA on the surface of collagen. It also shows that HACOM crystals has a dense feature, whereas the HAN crystals has soft porous surface. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed that the main elements of the hybrid sponge were carbon, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus. The EDS of HACOM crystal, present in the Col-HACOM composite showed a molar ratio Ca/P = 1.71, whereas the Col-HAN composite the molar ratio of calcium and phosphorus (Ca/P = 2.14) and the amount of carbon were greater. The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14) obtained for the anionic collagen was around 0.102 pC/N. The collagen composite with nanocrystalline HA crystals (Col-HAN) present a better result (d(14) = 0.040 pC/N) compared to the composite with the commercial ceramic (d(14) = 0.012 pC/N). This is an indication that the nanometric particles of HA present little disturbance on the organization of the collagen fibers in the composite. In this situation the nanometric HA are the best candidates in future applications of these composites.

The adhesion between the glycine headgroups is remarkably strong (FIR = -80 +/- 5 mN/m) and leads to the extraction of amphiphiles from the bilayers on surface separation. By SFA measurements and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on LB layers of glycine amphiphile variants, we determined that hydrogen bonding between amide and carbonyl groups on opposing surfaces is responsible for the strong adhesion. The strong adhesion is accompanied by a 7.5 Angstrom interpenetration of the glycine headgroups. At higher pH, charging of the carboxylic acid termini gives rise to electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces and reduces the strength of adhesion. Above pH 8.0, the surface charging blocks interpenetration and the adhesion is extinguished. Analysis of the forces required for amphiphile extraction shows that these amide hydrogen bonds are much stronger than those in aqueous environments. This observation has important implications in the study of protein stability and the design of self-assembled biomaterials.","Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Schneider, J (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"Schneider, James/C-4095-2008","Schneider, James/0000-0001-8016-8687",,,,57,10,10,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 14,2002.0,18,10,,,,,3923,3931,UNSP LA011486F,10.1021/la011486f,,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,550JR,WOS:000175500300026,,,,,2019-02-25

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photoelectrochemistry were employed as in-situ techniques to monitor the evolution of the passive film on exposure to simulated body fluid environments. Of particular interest were the selective interactions of phosphate and calcium ions present in simulated body fluid with the oxide films, immediately after exposure. The effects of these ions on the TiO2-electrolyte interface could be detected already within the first hour of exposure at 37 degreesC and were found to be the only ions present in simulated body fluid to interact with the titanium oxide surface. Photocurrent spectra showed no change in the semi-conductive properties of the passive Films on Ti and the two alloys. but large variations on the intensity of the generated photocurrent indicated the presence of adsorbed ions on the surface.

Development of the cytodetachment technique to quantify cellular adhesiveness. Biomaterials 20: 2405-2415, 1999), modified to test cells grown on substrata, as a means of calculating cell adhesion forces. Live and formalin-fixed bovine and rabbit chondrocytes underwent cytodetachment to verify that the cytodetacher provides satisfactory resolution to differentiate between live and fixed cells. Fixed cells had significantly greater mechanical adhesiveness than those prepared live: the values for the fixed rabbit and bovine chondrocytes were 1.01 and 1.56 muN, respectively, versus 0.14 and 0.17 muN for the live cells (p<0.05). The sensitivity of the cytodetacher was also gauged by detaching live rabbit chondrocytes seeded for varying amounts of time (40, 80, and 120 min). For the 40, 80, and 120 min time points the maximum detachment forces were found to be significantly different: 2.87x10(-2), 6.75x10(-2), and 14.30x10(-2) muN, respectively.

A precursor solution, containing liposomes suspended in aqueous human fibrinogen and transglutaminase (TGase), remained fluid for several hours in the dark, but gelled rapidly when exposed to 800 nm excitation, as a result of photosensitized Ca2+ release and TG-induced fibrinogen cross-linking. TGase and hrFXIII activities, determined using a fluorimetric dansylcadaverine assay, were found to depend strongly on irradiation time and reaction temperature. SDS-PAGE of the photolyzed reaction mixture revealed that gelation arises from enzyme-catalyzed cross-linking of predominately the alpha and gamma chains of fibrinogen.

In the second step, allyltetrafluoroethyl ether was grafted to these Si-H groups using a platinum-catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction. The influences of the plasma parameters of power, pressure, and treatment time on the surface composition, both before and after the hydrosilylation step, were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. It was found that the pressure had little influence on the results, whereas the power and treatment time determined the rate of change in surface composition during the plasma treatment. The graft yield reached a plateau value corresponding to about 5% grafted molecules in the analyzed surface region.

The CP reaction conditions were critical for producing PEG layers capable of minimizing protein adsorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that under these conditions, PEG(ald)(2) produced a thick linear PEG layer, most likely by aldol condensation. Protein adsorption was assessed using XPS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS) in the surface mode (Surface-MALDI-MS). Coatings grafted at non-CP conditions showed some protein adsorption, as did the HA/M-PEG layer grafted at the CP. On the other hand, no protein adsorption was detected on the HA/PEG(ald)(2), AIA/M-PEG, and AIA/PEG(ald)(2) surfaces when grafted at the CP. Thus, the effects of pinning density and chain length are interrelated, but the key factor is optimization of PEG chain density by use of the CP conditions, provided that a sufficient density of pinning sites exists.

A process to obtain pseudowollastonite coatings that may be applied to implants is described and evaluated in this work. The coatings were first deposited on titanium alloy by laser ablation with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser tripled in frequency. After deposition, they were submitted to a soft laser treatment with a continuous wave Nd:YAG infrared laser. Coatings were characterised by X-ray diffractometry, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy before and after the laser treatment. As-deposited coatings are composed of pseudowollastonite and amorphous material. They have a porous structure of gathered grains and poor cohesion. After the laser treatment the coatings crystallinity and cohesion are improved. The laser treatment also makes the coatings dense and well adhered to the substrate. Therefore, this two-step process has been demonstrated as a valuable method to coat titanium implants with pseudowollastonite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The current density during friction becomes higher than during the static condition. The fluctuation range of the current density caused by the destruction and formation of passive film was observed. For SUS316L stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo casting alloy, the fluctuation range was observed in the passivity zone. Otherwise, for Ti alloys, the fluctuation range was observed in both the activity and passivity zones. The decrease of the corrosion potential for Ti alloys due to friction was much larger than that of SUS316L stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo casting alloy. From this result, it was considered that in a the frictional environment, the stressing zone turned anodic and its periphery cathodic, and corrosion tended to progress more than in the static environment. The effect of wear on the anodic polarization curves also changed depending on the frictional load, potential zone and the pH of the solution. A rapid increase in current density due to corrosion starting from the frictional area was found in the Ti-6Al-4V and Ti 15Mo 5Zr-3Al alloys containing Al. However, for the new Ti-15Zr-4Nb-4Ta alloy, this rapid increase was not seen in the high-potential region. The effect of the lateral reciprocal speed was also negligible for the new Ti alloy. It was found that the new Ti 15Zr-4Nb-4Ta alloy exhibited excellent corrosion resistance under friction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since metallic biomaterials used for orthopedic and dental implants possess a paucity of reactive functional groups, biomolecular modification of these materials is challenging. In the present work, we investigated the use of a plasma surface modification strategy to enable immobilization of bioactive molecules on a ""bioinert"" metal. Conditions during plasma polymerization of allyl amine on Ti-6Al-4V were varied to yield 5 (""low"")- and 12 (""high"")-NH2/nm(2). One- and two-step carbodiimide schemes were used to immobilize lysozyme, a model biomolecule, and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) on the aminated surfaces. Both schemes could be varied to control the amount of protein bound, but the one-step method destroyed the activity of immobilized lysozyme because of crosslinking. BMP-4 was then immobilized using the two-step scheme. Although BMP bound to both low- and high-NH2 surfaces was initially able to induce alkaline phosphatase activity in pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells, only high amino group surfaces were effective following removal of weakly bound protein by incubation in cell culture medium.

This approach avoids the toxicity problem, associated with chemical crosslinking. Distinct changes in film morphology, from continuous surface coating to open porous format, were achieved by variation of processing parameters such Lis collagen:PCL ratio and the weight of the starting lyophilised collagen mat. Collagenase digestion indicated that the collagen content of 1:4 and 1:8 collagen:PCL biocomposites was almost totally accessible for enzymatic digestion indicating a high degree of collagen exposure for interaction with other ECM proteins or cells contacting the biomaterial Surface. Much reduced collagen exposure (around 50%) was measured for the 1:20 collagen:PCL materials. These findings were consistent with the SEM examination of collagen:PCL biocomposites which revealed a highly porous morphology for the 1:4 and 1:8 blends but virtually complete Coverage of the collagen component by PCL in the 1:20 samples. Investigations of the attachment and spreading characteristics of human osteoblast (HOB) cells on PCL films and collagen:PCL materials respectively. indicated that HOB cells poorly recognised PCL but attachment and spreading were much improved on the biocomposites. The non-chemically crosslinked, collagen:PCL biocomposites described are expected to provide a useful addition to the range of biomaterials and matrix systems for tissue engineering.

This is mainly due to the implant design, which most often are cylindrical, conical or threaded. In these models interlocking between bone and implant surface will increase the effect of genuine bone bonding and thus give a false positive outcome. The purpose of the present study was to establish a model for testing functional attachment of implants in situ, with minimal influence of interlocking and shear forces, The model involves the use of flat coin shaped implant placed onto the cortical bone of rabbit tibia without mechanical fixation to the bone. The implant is passively retained on the cortical bone by a titanium band retainer. During the healing period, the contact between the coin shaped implants and the bone is restricted to the flat test surfaces. To prevent interlocking effects from lateral bone attachments a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cap covering the vertical and the upper faces of the implants were used. The tensile test was performed with a gradual, calibrated pull, perpendicular to the bone-implant interface. This pullout model makes it possible to study the kinetics and strength of bone bonding with negligible influence of shear forces or mechanical interlocking. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The glycosaminoglycan. hyaluronan, has been shown to act as an antioxidant towards ROS. although the potential for biomaterials, such as HYAFF(R)-11p75 (the 75% benzyl ester of hyaluronan) and AQUACEL(R) (carboxymethylcellulose), to act in this manner has yet to be elucidated. This study compared the antioxidant properties of high and low molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWT HA and LMWT HA). HYAFF(R)-11p75, AQUACEL(R) and an AQUACEL(R)/hyaluronan composite (AQUACEL(R)/HA) against O-2(.-) and (OH)-O-.. The antioxidant capacities of each material were assessed by their ability to inhibit cytochrome C reduction by O-2(.-) fluxes. generated via the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase, and their inhibition of 2-deoxy-D-ribose degradation by (OH)-O-. fluxes, generated by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iron (Fe2+). All materials studied possessed dose dependent antioxidant properties towards O-2(.-), with HYAFF(R)-11p75 having the greatest antioxidant potential towards these species, followed by AQUACEL(R), HMWT HA. AQUACEL(R)/HA and LMWT HA. Only HMWT HA exhibited dose dependent antioxidant properties towards (OH)-O-. at the fluxes examined. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis implied that ester bonds between the hyaluronan backbone and benzyl groups of HYAFF(R)-11p75 are highly susceptible to O-2(.-) hydrolysis., with the de-esterified benzyl alcohol being rapidly degraded in the presence of (OH)-O-.. This data supports the hypothesis that HYAFF(R)-11p75 has greater antioxidant capacity towards O-2(.-), due to the esterified benzyl groups providing alternative sites for O-2(.) attack other than the hyaluronan backbone of HYAFF(R)-11p75 itself and explains the inability of HYAFF(R)-11p75 to scavenge (OH)-O-., due to benzyl alcohol degradation by (OH)-O-.. The antioxidant activities of these biomaterials. particularly HYAFF(R)-11p75 and AQUACEL(R). towards O-2(.-) could be beneficial. as the scavenging of PMN-derived O-2(.-) may remove initial sources of O-2(.-) and further prevent the secondary formation of (OH)-O-.. These ROS are thought to be a primary causal factor for the extensive degradation and metabolic alterations observed in chronic wounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This method is characterized as follows: (1) simple extraction of the analytes from biomaterials with perchloric acid/methanol; (2) sensitive quantitation of major metabolites (SN-38G, SN-38 and APC) with a fluorescence detector (FLD), where the limits of quantitation by FLD were 2.5 ng/mL for SN-38G and APC, 5 ng/mL for CPT-11 and 1 ng/mL for SN-38, respectively; (3) parallel selective monitoring of the metabolites including minor metabolites with a mass selected detector (MSD). There was no observed interference by other drugs expected to be co-administered. This method showed its usefulness by identifying a novel metabolite produced in human hepatic microsomes. The results indicate that this combination of FLD and MSD enables a highly selective analysis of CPT-11 and its metabolites, and is useful for studies both in vivo and in vitro.

Carbon source at 50 g l(-1) (dextrose equivalents) of molasses and nitrogen source at 50 g l(-1) (weight/volume) of peanut seed cake were found to be optimal levels to yield higher riboflavin. Among the organic wastes, (beef extract, hog casings, blood meal, fish meal) hog casings in association with fish meal supported the highest yield of riboflavin. Among the different recovery processes studied, a vacuum drying process was the most efficient allowing maximum yield, followed by drying at 90 degreesC and freeze-drying. It is apparent from this study that inexpensive or waste organic materials could induce E. ashbyii to synthesize and secrete riboflavin at higher levels in the medium and this could be purified using a vacuum drying process.

There has been limited success with the first approach. Intravascular catheters and cuffs with an antimicrobial coating have been developed in recent years. Nevertheless, preventive strategies should avoid the use of therapeutic antibiotics. Exposure to antimicrobial agents could favor the development of resistance or the expression of genes responsible for biofilm formation. The use of these catheters should be restricted to situations where the rate of infection is high despite adherence to other strategies that do not incorporate antimicrobial agents. Better knowledge of the pathogenesis of catheter-related infections will facilitate the design of new devices that avoid the use of antimicrobial agents and decrease the risk of associated bloodstream infections. This could include the use of 'biospecific polymers' coated with anti-adhesive molecules or the use of agents which might block the expression of genes controlling biofilm formation for the most prevalent pathogens.","Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Seville 41080, Spain","Pascual, A (reprint author), Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Apdo Correos 914, Seville 41080, Spain.",,"Pascual, Alvaro/Y-5854-2018","Pascual, Alvaro/0000-0002-8672-5891",,,,47,70,78,1,13,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1198-743X,,,CLIN MICROBIOL INFEC,Clin.

Natural tissues have been used for both soft and hard repair and replacement, but they do have serious limitations such as: shortage of donor tissue, donor site morbidity, unpredictable resorption characteristics, immunogenic response, risk of disease transmission, and ethical limitations. Tissue engineering is a relatively new approach, in which healthy mammalian cells are used with supporting matrices, usually made of either natural or synthetic polymers as composite bioartificial implants. Primary cells, especially embryonic stem cells, cell lines, hybridomas, genetically modified cells are considered as potential sources for this application. Both closed and open matrices are used as support matrices.

However, generally speaking, many polymers have not yet been designed for their final application. To date, many polymers are still taken from the chemist's shelf according to their alleged performance properties or to their sterilisability. When used in medical application, polymers must show a high purity. Uncontrolled leaching of oligomers from the polymer backbone or of additives from or during the manufacturing process must be avoided. Blood and other body fluids are extremely effective in extracting any loosely bound polymers. During long-term application, e.g. in patients suffering from chronic diseases, these effects may lead to an accumulation of these compounds in circulating blood, tissue, or joints. Consequently, polymers should show an excellent biostability and not degrade during their ageing process. The amount of extractable material should be kept low in order to avoid inflammatory reactions. Polymers must have high blood compatibility in terms of minimized cell-and complement activation. Polymers for medical application should at best be able to stand high temperatures in order to survive steam sterilisation. If this is impossible, their release kinetics for residual quantities of sterilizing agents should be fast. Finally, protein adsorption should appear under controlled conditions, otherwise a reduced performance through protein adsorption will take place. Further, the uncontrolled activation of biochemical cascades, such as the coagulation, complement or contact phase cascade, following blood/material contact must be minimized. A final aspect has been recently made responsible for adverse patients reactions, the interaction between polymers and medicinal drugs. This drug/material interaction must be low, at best zero, apart form those situations, where a controlled drug-release is wanted. The chemical variety of polymers for medical application is large. However, all typical requirements cannot be met by one single polymer. Compromises have to be found between properties and application. Polymer selection for application in nephrology has always to be made under the premise of final application.","Fresenius Med Care, Dept Biosci, D-61342 Bad Homburg, Germany","Vienken, J (reprint author), Fresenius Med Care, Dept Biosci, Else Kroenerstr 1, D-61342 Bad Homburg, Germany.",,,,,,,51,13,13,0,9,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

It also examined the surface characteristics of these materials. Materials and Methods: The 11 materials tested fell into 3 groups: (1) bone-derived, including freeze-dried human rib block, human demineralized freeze-dried bone, and deproteinated bovine bone; (2) synthetic hydroxyapatites (HA); and (3) synthetic non-HA, including coated methacrylates and coated silica glass. After 4 days in culture, 1 group of samples of each material underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate resorptive pitting versus controls, while another group underwent tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and light microscopy to examine osteoclast numbers and morphology. The 2 bovine-derived HA materials also underwent immunohistochemical staining and surface chemistry analysis. Results: While most of these materials supported osteoclast attachment, some spreading, and survival in culture, only the bone-derived materials, with the exception of sintered deproteinated bovine bone, showed large scalloped-edged resorption pits with trails and exposed collagen when examined by SEM, although not to the same extent as unprocessed natural bone material. The HA materials and the sintered deproteinated bovine bone showed evidence of etching with smaller pits but no evidence of resorptive trail formation. The non-HA materials showed no evidence of pit formation or trails. Under immunohistochemical staining, Bio-Oss appeared to be positive for type I collagen after osteoclast activity on its surface, while Osteograf/N showed no positive staining. Surface chemistry analysis revealed nitrogen present in Bio-Oss specimens (0.17% to 0.47%), while there was no nitrogen detected in the Osteograf/N (0.00%); the percent nitrogen observed in normal bovine bone controls was 6.01% to 9.25%. Discussion: The bone-derived materials supported osteoclast activity on the material surface in a way that facilitated formation of the more complex resorption pits in vitro. Assuming the rate of pit formation observed in vitro mimics that observed in vivo, the quantity and type of osteoclastic remodeling seen on non-bone-derived materials-and perhaps sintered bone-derived materials-would be extremely slow to negligible. Physiologic removal of non-bone-derived bone substitutes in vivo may occur by methods other than osteoclast resorption. Conclusions: Allogenous and xenogenous bone-derived materials that undergo delayed physiologic resorption may be more appropriately used with a staged surgical approach when used in sites intended to support osseointegrated dental implants. The combination of collagen staining and the presence of nitrogen suggest that there may be residual protein in Bio-Oss.","Natl Def Med Ctr, Canadian Forces Dent Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Prosthodont, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Appl Oral Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Dept Surg, Halifax, NS B3H 4H2, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4H2, Canada","Taylor, JC (reprint author), 214-532 Montreal Rd, Ottawa, ON K1K 4R4, Canada.",jctaylor@istar.ca,,,,,,103,66,70,0,10,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Results: The anodic oxide film was observed to consist of a porous or non-uniform layer and a dense or uniform layer. X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopic analyses indicated that the film consisted of a mixture of anatase and amorphous oxide, with the incorporation of phosphorus. Discussion: The degree of oxide crystallinity was observed to increase with an increase in voltage but decreased as the electrolyte concentration was increased. In addition, the concentration of phosphorus also increased as the electrolyte concentration and voltage increased.

The method is based on the swelling ability of starch when it is heated to 80degreesC in the presence of water. An OHAp powder prepared by a precipitation method and heat treated at 900degreesC to obtain an appropriate specific surface area for colloidal processing was used in the present work. Wet ball milling was required to deagglomerate the powder and improve its processing ability. Different starch volume fractions and starch particle sides were added to the OHAp slurries, which were then heat treated to promote consolidation by starch gelification. A linear relationship between the planned and measured porosity values was observed. SEM pictures reveal the presence of interconnected pores with shape and sizes corresponding to starch granules used. Flexural strength varied from about 2 to 15 MPa, for pore volume fractions of similar to70 and 45%, respectively. A degradation study in an acellular synthetic body fluid (SBF) has shown that the prepared bodies keep their integrity under physiological conditions during the studied time. The method offers possibilities of manufacturing materials that can be used as scaffolds engineering and/or systems for controlled delivery of drugs.

The particles are often mixed with a protein product (Tisseel(R)) to form a mouldable graft material. Aim: The aim of the present experiment was to study the healing of self-contained bone defects after the placement of Bio-Oss(R) particles alone or mixed with Tisseel(R) in cylindrical defects in the edentulous mandibular ridge of dogs. Material and methods: In 4 labrador dogs, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th mandibular premolars were extracted bilaterally. 3 months later, 3 cylindrical bone defects, 4 mm in diameter and 8 mm in depth, were produced in the right side of the mandible. Following a crestal incision, full thickness flaps were raised and the bone defects were prepared with a trephine drill. The defects were filled with Bio-Oss(R) (Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhuser, Switzerland) particles alone or mixed with Tisseel(R) (Immuno AG, Vienna, Austria), or left ""untreated"". A collagen membrane (Bio-Gide(R), Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhuser, Switzerland) was placed to cover all defects and the flaps were sutured. 2 months later, the defect preparation and grafting procedures were repeated in the left side of the mandible. After another month, the animals were sacrificed and biopsies obtained from the defect sites. Results: Bio-Oss(R)-treated defects revealed a higher percentage of contact between graft particles and bone tissue than defects treated with Bio-Oss(R) + Tisseel(R) (15% and 30% at 1 and 3 months versus 0.4% and 8%, respectively). Further, the volume of connective tissue in the Bio-Oss(R) treated defects decreased from the I to the 3 month interval (from 44% to 30%). This soft tissue was replaced with newly formed bone. In the Bio-Oss(R) + Tisseel(R) treated defects, however, the proportion of connective tissue remained unchanged between 1 and 3 months. Conclusion: The adjunct of Tisseel(R) may jeopardize the integration of Bio-Oss(R) particles with bone tissue.","Fac Odontol, Dept Periodontol, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Carmagnola, D (reprint author), Fac Odontol, Dept Periodontol, Box 450, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,17,70,73,0,2,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0303-6979,,,J CLIN PERIODONTOL,J.

We focus on the interface kinetics which is slow as compared to the diffusion mass transport which is typical of protein crystal growth, Independently, full-scale numerical solutions of transport equations around a cylindrical crystal, at the center of the bottom of a cylindrical cell filled with the solution, are found. The two approaches give results that agree over a wide range of parameters, providing dimensionless relationships that allow predictions of the contribution of convection and diffusion to mass transport. Requirements for microgravity level in Space experiments to achieve diffusional mass transport are estimated on the basis of these relationships. Coefficients of impurity distribution between a growing crystal and its solution, under the influences of convection and diffusion around the crystal, were numerically evaluated as functions of time. The results provide further support for the hypothesis concerning the role of the impurity depletion zone in the purification of a growing crystal. They also reveal that in general, the impurity distribution within the crystal is not homogeneous due to convection. The effects of various factors on growth kinetics and crystal purity are considered.

Hence, a new experimental endocarditis model was evaluated that enables quantitative in-vivo testing of bacterial adherence to prosthetic materials. Methods: In 53 rabbits, different patches of either Dacron (DAC; n = 16), glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardium (GAP; n = 18) or cryopreserved allograft (AG; n = 19) were threaded onto a Prolene suture and led through a stitch incision at the left atrium to the ventricle, perforating the mitral valve and leaving the heart at the outside of the left ventricle. The patch became caught in the valve tissue, creating mitral insufficiency. At 6 h after surgery, 6 x 106 colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus were administered intravenously. Postmortem examination and further analysis were carried out 48 h after bacterial inoculation. Results: Ten animals (two DAC, four GAP, four AG) died and were excluded. Subsequently, sterile patches were found in 6/14 animals of the DAC group, in 9/14 of the GAP group, and in 9/15 of the AG group. The mean numbers of cultured organisms in the remaining patches were 2.3 x 10(6) +/- 7.6 x 10(6)/mg (DAC), 1.8 x 10(4) +/- 6.7 x 10(4)/mg (GAP) and 4.9 x 10(5) +/- 1.0 x 10(6) CFU/mg (AG). Differences in the number of CFU were not significant for all groups. Conclusion: The above-described model allows reliable quantitative in-vivo testing of bacterial adherence to different prosthetic materials within a short time period. The results suggest that, with regard to avoiding the development of bacterial endocarditis, biomaterials have no advantage over Dacron.","German Heart Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, D-80636 Munich, Germany","Eichinger, WB (reprint author), German Heart Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Lazarettstr 36, D-80636 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,34,4,6,0,0,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD HA6 2ET, ENGLAND",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

Monocytic cell lines such as the THP-1 cell line have been used extensively as models for primary monocytes (directly from blood) in biocompatibility research. However, little information exists about the appropriateness of these cell lines as models. Thus, the current study compared the biological response of both primary peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) and the THP-1 cell line to four common components of dental materials known to be released into the oral environment: nickel ions, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), and 2,2-bis[4(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloloxy)-phenyl]propane (Bis-GMA). Comparisons were made by constructing dose-response curves for each type of monocyte and the four components. The 50% cytotoxicity values (TC50 values) were then statistically compared. In addition, the response of the monocytes to the materials with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were assessed by measuring TNF-alpha secretion from the monocytes. The results showed that the PBMs were 5-10 times less sensitive than the THP-1 monocytes to these dental components, but that both cell lines ranked the components identically. TNF-alpha secretion from both types of monocytes often showed similar trends, although some inconsistent results were noted. The current study supports the use of THP-1s as a model for ranking the cytotoxicity of components of dental biomaterials. Furthermore, the secretory activity of PBMs appears to be generally well represented by the THP-1s. However, sufficient differences between these cell types exist to recommend confirmation of any critical results obtained with THP-1s using PBMs.","Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Maxillofacial Pathol, Augusta, GA 30912 USA","Wataha, JC (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,22,68,69,1,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-182X,,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

Radiation is also used to design of biochips, and in situ photopolymerizable of bioadhesives, The energy sources most commonly used in the irradiation of biomaterials are high-energy electrons, gamma radiation, ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. Surface modification involves placement of selective chemical moieties on the surface of a material by chemical reactions to improve biointeraction for cell adhesion and proliferation, hemocompatibility and water absorption. The exposure of a polymer to radiation, especially ionizing radiation, can lead to chain scission or crosslinking with changes in bulk and surface properties. Sterilization by irradiation is designed to inactivate most pathogens from the surface of biomedical devices. An overview of the use of gamma and UV radiation to improve surface tissue compatibility, bulk properties and surface properties for wear resistance, formation of hydrogels and Curing dental sealants and bone adhesives is presented.

Ion implantation enhances biological cell/tissue growth on, and tissue adhesion to, prosthetic devices made from GPC. We have previously shown that increased porosity of GPC is also useful for drug delivery devices. The porosity of the ion implanted partially and fully cured precursor phenolic resins was measured by introducing lithium from a molten LiCl salt into each sample. By using Li(p, 2alpha) nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) we measured the concentration of Li retention in the pre- and post-implanted samples. The surface roughness was measured using optical microscopy. The curing process was monitored using micro-Raman microscopy.

Knowledge obtained from protein-folding studies sheds much light on our understanding of the heteropolymer behavior. Consequently, it is possible to design synthetic heteropolymers with specific structure that can fold into unique conformations, form receptor-like cavities and recognize specific target molecules. Recent studies towards simplifying the requirement for the heteropolymer structures and the polymerization procedures are reviewed. Intelligent polymer gels can be designed with new and interesting characteristics of molecular imprinting.

These composites were molded into tensile test bars using two molding techniques: i) conventional injection molding and ii) shear controlled orientation in injection molding (SCORIM. The bars produced were mechanically characterized by means of tensile testing and dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA). The structure of the moldings was assessed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and the failure surfaces of the moldings analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The enhancement of stiffness observed with HA reinforcement results partially from the stiffening effect of the blend associated with the decrease in plasticizer content during the compounding stage. SCORIM was able to further increase the stiffness of SEVA-C/HA composites, allowing a maximum improvement of 12% for 30% wt. HA as compared to conventional molding. DMA results showed that the reinforcement of SEVA-C causes the broadening of the relaxation peak of the polymer, suggesting a structural change within the starch fraction that may be related with thermal degradation of the polymer. The addition of HA particles reduces the prefer-red orientation exhibited by the SEVA-C matrix, which is believed to limit the maximum mechanical performance that can be attained. Nevertheless, composites based on a biodegradable matrix with modulus above 7 GPa (in the bounds of the lower limit for human cortical bone) could be successfully produced.","Univ Minho, Dept Polymer Engn, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; Brunel Univ, Wolfson Ctr Mat Proc, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England","Sousa, RA (reprint author), Univ Minho, Dept Polymer Engn, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",,"Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008; Mano, Joao/A-4418-2009; Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012","Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Mano, Joao/0000-0002-2342-3765; Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Sousa, Rui/0000-0003-0362-7418; Cunha M., Antonio/0000-0003-3860-7732",,,,25,45,46,0,7,SOC PLASTICS ENG INC,BROOKFIELD,"14 FAIRFIELD DR, BROOKFIELD, CT 06804-0403 USA",0032-3888,,,POLYM ENG SCI,Polym.

We considered samples of linear hydrocarbons electrically grounded at one of their extremes. The other extreme is electrically connected to the microscope tip via electron tunneling through vacuum. When a voltage, V, is applied to the tip, electric current, I, flows in the tip-sample circuit. This current varies as the voltage varies and depends on the DOS to the extent that no current would flow if no electron states exist at a certain energy (or voltage). The detailed relationship between DOS and the current-voltage (I-V) curve is not known a priori. We solve the corresponding quantum problem in the context of tight binding and find that I-V reproduces accurately the resonant energy peaks of the DOS. We apply the results to 100 atom-long alkane and alkene chains and found that there is a significant voltage shift in the corresponding curves as to discriminate one structure from the other.","Yeshiva Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10033 USA","Zypman, FR (reprint author), Yeshiva Univ, Dept Phys, 500 W 185th St, New York, NY 10033 USA.",,,,NCI NIH HHS [CA77796-02],,,17,1,1,0,2,FAMS INC,MAHWAH,"BOX 832, MAHWAH, NJ 07430-0832 USA",0161-0457,,,SCANNING,Scanning,MAY-JUN,2002.0,24,3,,,,,154,156,,,,,,3,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,558TY,WOS:000175983700008,12074497.0,,,,2019-02-25

In this work, the adsorption behavior of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) onto hydrophilic (silicon wafers and amino-terminated surfaces), hydrophobic (polystyrene), and charged (sulfonated polystyrene films) substrates was investigated by means of in situ ellipsometry, contact angle measurements, and atomic force microscopy. CPK is an interesting biomolecule due to its large application in the diagnosis for myocardial infarction and muscle disorders. In the dilute regime (c similar to 0.005 g/L) the ellipsometric measurements revealed that the kinetics adsorption process of CPK onto silicon wafers and amino-terminated surfaces can be divided into four stages: (i) a diffusive one, (ii) adsorption and rearrangement, (iii) formation of a monolayer, and (iv) continuous and irreversible adsorption caused by relaxation process and cooperative binding. This seems to be the first time that such a behavior has been experimentally observed. For more concentrated solutions, the CPK formed aggregates in solution and, therefore, the adsorption increased continuously with time. CPK adsorbed irreversibly either on hydrophilic or on hydrophobic substrates. The adsorption isotherms showed a preferential adhesion of CPK onto the hydrophilic substrates. Since hydrophilic segments predominate the CPK structure, hydrogen bonding seems to play a major role in the adsorption process.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, BR-05513900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Univ Karlsruhe, Inst Angew Phys, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany; Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Nanotechnol, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany","Petri, DFS (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, POB 26077, BR-05513900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",,"PETRI, DENISE/H-5004-2012; Institute of Chemistry - USP, Dept. of Chemistry/B-8988-2012; Gliemann, Hartmut/J-8193-2013",,,,,34,14,16,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,APR 30,2002.0,18,9,,,,,3517,3523,,10.1021/la0110693,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,546TF,WOS:000175289600023,,,,,2019-02-25

The complexes found presented a complexing ability through both the chelating moieties of Hyal (via the N-glucosamine and D-glucoronic acid), showing no special preference for either one while in solid state, but when in aqueous solution the complexation via the N-glucosamine moiety was the preferred, forming two complexed species, ML and ML2 (log K-ML = 8.2 and log K-ML2=7.9). The presence of a mu-oxo complex via the D-glucoronic acid was also detected in both aqueous (log K=6.7) and solid states via the N-glucosamine and D-glucoronic acid simultaneously linked to two Hyal chains.

The crystals obtained were found to consist of a mixture of poor crystallized hydroxyapatite (HA) and octacalcium phosphate (OCP). The threshold concentration (when crystallization started) measured by the turbidity technique appeared to be 5.5 mM. Presence of poly-L-glutamic acid previously adsorbed onto the silica seemed to promote the crystallization, while similar layer of poly-L-aspartic acid was found to have no influence. When dissolved, both polypeptides were found to inhibit the crystallization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The grafted spheres showed very good swelling behavior in water due to the incorporation of hydrophilicity in the PP spheres. The influence of pH and temperature on as well as the determination of the kinetic parameters, K-M and V-max for both immobilized and soluble invertase were determined. PP-g-(VP-co-DMAM) grafting onto the PP spheres caused a significant change in the water content of the support and was more pronounced for the spheres with a high degree of grafting. A porous structure of the polymeric spheres was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porous structure contributed to the reaction rate decrease due to diffusional effects, as shown by the larger K-M value observed for immobilized invertase relative to the free enzyme. The enzyme affinity for the substrate (K-M/V-max) remains quite good after immobilization. The thermal stability of immobilized invertase was significatively higher than that of the free enzyme and a displacement of 20degreesC was observed for the immobilized enzyme.

The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the treated specimens were enhanced with respect to those of the untreated specimens. An increase in the fiber content (C-f) resulted in an increase in this enhancement tendency until C-f was 45%. A further increase in C-f increased the tensile modulus but decreased the strength. The flexural strength and flexural modulus were increased for the irradiation-treated specimens in the same way as the tensile test. The microstructure of the tensile fracture showed an improvement in interfacial bonding for the irradiated specimens. The glass-transition temperature (T-g) of the composite increased with an increase in C-f for the irradiation-treated specimens, but there was no change in T-g for the untreated specimens with various values of C-f This indicated that, for the composites with irradiation treatment, the fiber intensively affected the molecular segmental motion of PCL and thereby enhanced the interfacial interaction between the matrices and fibers. The same slope of the storage modulus (G') versus the loss modulus (G"") for the irradiated specimens suggested an increase in the compatibility of the composite in comparison with the decrease in the slope with increasing C-f for the untreated specimens. All this demonstrated that there was some interfacial reaction between the fiber and matrix that resulted in the presence of an interfacial phase and improved the mechanical properties of the materials.

The interaction between GS and EDA(+)FN was evaluated using the affinity constant (KA); the value obtained was 1.03 x 10(8) (M-1). These results suggest that the adhesion of HUVEC to GS may be supported by the adhesion of EDA(+)FN to GS.

The graft involved a Williamson reaction between the free hydroxyl function of HEC and the epoxy function of the two silanes. As the grafted silanes tire in ionic form (sodium silanolate), this product remains in gel form at basic pH (> 12.3) in aqueous solution. When pH decreases, sodium silanolate is transformed into silanol (2 or 3 silanol functions tire carried by silicon, depending on the silane grafted). The silanols interreact, and the gel is transformed into a cross-linking form at room or body temperature. Studies were conducted to optimise this product for specific uses. Steam sterilization was used to compare self-hardening as a function of the silane grafted. Our previous work indicated that HEC grafted with GPTMS has good reactivity, but requires high pH for dissolution, whereas dissolution occurs at lower pH with GPMDS. The rate of silanol condensation for silated HEC was then determined as a function of pH, temperature, type of silane, and the percentage grafted. Condensation rates were ascertained by the viscosity method, and gels were neutralized by different solutions to obtain buffered forms at various pH. The time required to obtain 10(5) mPa . s, with an initial state of 2500 mPa . s, was then calculated. Condensation was catalysed in acid or basic medium at a lower rate at pH 5.5-6.5, and a temperature rise increased the condensation rate, regardless of the pH or silane studied. Silanetriol was more reactive than silanediol. However, as HEC lost considerable viscosity after sterilization, further studies will be conducted to develop new polysaccharides grafted with silane.

The vinyl group containing viologen was synthesized by the double Anderson reaction using 4,4'-bipyridine and vinyl benzyl chloride and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The graft copolymerization of VBV was carried out by placing the plasma-pretreated substrate in contact with an aqueous solution of VBV under W irradiation. The effects of the plasma-pretreatment time of the substrate, UV-induced graft copolymerization time, and monomer concentration on the VBV-graft copolymer concentration were investigated. The responses of the VBV-graft-copolymerized LDPE films and silanized glass slides to photoirradiation were monitored. In both cases, intensely blue viologen radical cations were formed after 10 min of W irradiation in a vacuum and bleaching occurred when the substrate was exposed to air upon termination of the irradiation. VBV-graft-copolymerized PANI films with goad conductivity can be prepared, and these films may have possible applications as active templates in biosensors where the viologen groups may serve as electron transfer mediators from the electrode surface to the active site of biomaterials. This method of surface functionalization of viologen moieties offers a number of advantages over a previously developed technique.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore","Neoh, KG (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",,"Kang, En-Tang/G-8522-2012","Kang, En-Tang/0000-0003-0599-7834; Neoh, Koon Gee/0000-0002-2700-1914",,,,47,26,28,1,18,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,APR 2,2002.0,18,7,,,,,2914,2921,,10.1021/la011666p,,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,537XF,WOS:000174784400065,,,,,2019-02-25

The nanoshells were assembled layer-by-layer (LBL), with negatively charged poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) to produce coatings with a network of voids and channels in the interior of the film. The diameter of the channels in the titania shells was comparable to the thickness of the electrical double layer in porous matter (0.3-30 nm). The prepared nanoparticulate films demonstrated strong ion-sieving properties due to the exclusion of some ions from the diffuse region of the electrical double layer. The permeation of ions could be tuned effectively by the pH and ionic strength of a solution between ""open"" and ""closed"" states. The ion-separation effect was utilized for the selective determination of one of the most important neurotransmitters, dopamine, on a background of ascorbic acid. Under physiological conditions, the negative charge on the surface of TiO2 facilitated the permeation of positively charged dopamine through the LBL film to the electrode, preventing the access of the negatively charged ascorbic acid. The deposition of the nanoshell/polyelectrolyte film resulted in a significant improvement to the selectivity of dopamine determination. The prepared nanoshell films were also found to be compatible with nervous tissue secreting dopamine. Although the obtained data demonstrated the potential of TiO2 LBL films for implantable biomedical devices for nerve tissue monitoring, the problem of electrode poisoning by the by-products of dopamine reduction has yet to be resolved.","Univ Vigo, Dept Quim Fis, E-36200 Vigo, Spain; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Chem, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Noble Res Ctr, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; Hahn Meitner Inst Berlin GmbH, Phys Chem Abt, D-15109 Berlin, Germany; Univ Vigo, CACTI, E-36200 Vigo, Spain","Liz-Marzan, LM (reprint author), Univ Vigo, Dept Quim Fis, E-36200 Vigo, Spain.",lmarzan@uvigo.es; kotov@okstate.edu,"Liz-Marzan, Luis/B-8910-2011; pastoriza Santos, Isabel/D-4015-2013","Liz-Marzan, Luis/0000-0002-6647-1353; pastoriza Santos, Isabel/0000-0002-1091-1364; Kotov, Nicholas/0000-0002-6864-5804",,,,109,114,116,3,94,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1616-301X,1616-3028,,ADV FUNCT MATER,Adv.

In this experience we attempted to compare the effect of roughness organization of Ti6Al4V or pure titanium substrates on human osteoblast (hOB) response (proliferation, adhesion). Surface roughness was extensively analyzed at scales above the cell size (macro-roughness) or below the cell size (micro-roughness) by calculation of relevant classic amplitude parameters (Ra, Rt) and original frequency parameters (Order, Delta). We developed a new process to prepare isotropic surfaces (electro-erosion), which were compared to isotropic surfaces obtained by polishing and anisotropic surfaces obtained by machine-tooling. The hOB response on electro-eroded (EE) Ti6Al4V surfaces or pure titanium (Ti) surfaces was largely increased when compared to polished or machine-tooled surfaces after 21 days of culture. Moreover, the polygonal morphology of hOB on these EE surfaces was very close to the aspects of hOB in vivo on human bone trabeculae. By a complete description of the surface topography of EE surfaces, we concluded that when the topography was considered below the call scale, hOB appreciated their isotropic smooth aspect, although when the topography was considered above the cell scale they appreciated their rough isotropic 'landscape' formed by many 'bowl-like nests' favouring cell adhesion and growth. Electro-erosion is a promising method for preparation of bone implant surfaces, as it could easily be applied to preparation of most biomaterials with complex geometries.

The properties of control films. WSC-modified and entrapment-treated PDLLA films were investigated by water contact angle measurement and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The water-contact angle measurement indicated the change of hydrophilicity and the ESCA analysis suggested that the modified PDLLA film using silk fibroin became enriched with nitrogen atoms. The biocompatibility of PDLLA film might be altered, which in turn would affect the functions of cells that were seeded on it. Therefore, attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts that were seeded on modified PDLLA films and control films were examined. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay and differentiated cell function was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, These results suggested that silk fibroin was used to modify PDLLA surface via WSC and that entrapment could improve the interactions between osteoblasts and PDLLA films. The entrapment treatment was more effective than WSC treatment to accomplish the goal of surface modification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thus, SPU surfaces were modified. by grafting of hexamethylenediisocyanate, and the free isocyanate remaining on the SPU surface were then coupled through a condensation reaction to amine groups of p-aminosalicylic acid. The bonding of PAS from aqueous solution onto SPU surface was studied by ATR-FTIR, UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. Plateau levels of coupled PAS were reached within 1.2 mug/cm(2) using PAS solution concentrations of 1 mg/ml. The surface wettability of the polymeric films measured by contact angle indicate that the introduction of the PAS turns the surface more hydrophilic (theta(water) = 43.1degrees +/- 2.1degrees) relatively to the original SPU films (theta(water) = 70.3degrees +/- 1.9degrees). The in vitro albumin (BSA) adsorption shows that the PAS SPU films adsorb more BSA (250/mug mm(2)) than the original SPU (112 mug/mm(2)). Thrombogenicity was assessed by measuring the thrombus formation and platelet adhesion of the SPU containing PAS relatively to nonmodified SPU surfaces. The polymeric surfaces with immobilized PAS had better nonthrombogenic characteristics as indicated by the low platelet adhesion, high adsorption of albumin relatively to fibrinogen and low thrombus formation, making them potentially good candidates for biomedical applications.

Although these polymers have shown good biocompatibility, concerns have been raised regarding their acidic degradation products, which have important implications for long-term implantable systems. Therefore, we have designed a novel biodegradable polyphosphazene/poly(alpha-hydroxyester) blend whose degradation products tire less acidic than those of the poly(alpha-hydroxyester) alone. In this study, the degradation characteristics of a blend of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (50: 50 PLAGA) and poly[(50% ethyl glycinato)(50% p-methylphenoxy) phosphazene] (PPHOS-EG50) were qualitatively and quantitatively determined with comparisons made to the parent polymers. Circular matrices (14nim diameter) of the PLAGA, PPHOS-EG50 and PLAGA PPHOS-EG50 blend were degraded in nonbuffered solutions (pH 7.4). The degraded polymers were characterized for percentage mass loss and molecular weight and the degradation medium was characterized for acid released in non-buffered solutions. The amounts of neutralizing base necessary to bring about neutral pH were measured for each polymer or polymer blend during degradation. The poly(phosphazene), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) blend required significantly less neutralizing base in order to bring about neutral solution pH during the degradation period studied. The results indicated that the blend degraded at a rate intermediate to that of the parent polymers and that the degradation products of the polyphosphazene neutralized the acidic degradation products of PLAGA. Thus, results from these in vitro degradation studies suggest that the PLAGA PPHOS-EG50 blend may provide a viable improvement to biomaterials based on acid-releasing organic polymers.

Full-thickness non-critical size defects were made bilaterally in the calvaria of 21 adult Wistar rats. One side was filled by TCP granules, the contralateral side was left empty and used as a control. Animals were sacrificed in defined time intervals up to 6 months. Bone regeneration was analyzed with special respect toward the micromorphological and microanalytical features of the material-bone interaction by electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis. Histologic examination revealed no TCP degradation even after 6 months of implantation. In contrast, a nearly complete bone regeneration of control defects was found after 6 months. At all times TCP was surrounded by a thin fibrous layer without presence of osteoblasts and features of regular mineralization. As far as degradation and substitution are concerned, TCP is a less favourable material under conditions of non-loading. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, neutrophil platelet interaction on uncoated or protein-coated polymer surfaces was investigated. Cell spreading, reorganization of actin filaments and release of oxygen metabolites (measured as luminol-amplified chemiluminescence) were used as criteria for cell activation on positively charged, hydrophilic 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and negatively charged, hydrophobic hexamethylene-disiloxane. The model surfaces were made by radio frequency plasma discharge polymerization. Neutrophil contact with the uncoated polymers induced a prolonged generation of oxygen radicals. Precoating of the polymer surfaces with human serum albumin (HSA) or fibrinogen, markedly reduced neutrophil activation, whereas coating with human immunoglobulin G (IgG), a well-known opsonin. resulted in significantly higher levels of cell activation. Consequently, protein coating overruled the activating effects of the polymer surfaces. The presence of unstimulated or thrombin-stimulated platelets markedly increased the reactivity of neutrophils against fibrinogen- and I-G-coated surfaces. However, neutrophils remained relatively unreactive in the presence of platelets on HSA-treated surfaces. Comparison of the different types of surfaces used, reveals a correlation between the degree of cell spreading, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the amount of oxygen radicals produced. Our results suggest that the acute inflammatory reaction on a biomaterial surface is highly dependent on the nature and composition of the first adsorbed protein layer and the extent of platelet activation.

By varying PEO length (MW = 2000 or 3400), hydrophobic components (PTMO or PDMS) or polymer topology (block or graft copolymers), various physical hydrogels were produced. Their structures were verified by, H-1 NMR and ATR-IR and the molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography. The hydrogels were soluble in a variety of organic solvents, while absorbed a significant amount of water with preserved three-dimensional structure by physical crosslinking. The dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that the surface hydrophilicity increased by incorporating longer PEO, PEO grafting, and adopting PDMS as a hydrophobic segment instead of PTMO. It was observed from in vitro protein adsorption Study that the hydrogels exhibited significantly lower adsorption Of human scrum albumin (HSA), human fibrinogen (HFg), and IgG, when compared with Pellethane (H), a commercial polyurethane taken as a control. The hydrogels were attractive for HSA but not sensitive to HFg and I-G. And more than 65% of the proteins detected on the surfaces of the hydrogels were reversibly detached by being treated with an SDS solution. It was evident that the hydrogels synthesized in this Study were much more resistant to platelet adhesion than the control, which might depend on the composition of proteins adsorbed on the surfaces and their degree of denaturation, Among the hydrogels tested, PE03.4kPDMS exhibited albumin-rich and platelet-resistant surfaces, implying a potential candidate for biomaterial.

In this study, we have investigated the bone tissue reactions to turned commercially pure (c.p.) titanium implants with various thicknesses of the oxide films after 6 weeks of insertion in rabbit bone. The control c.p. titanium implants had an oxide thickness of 17-200 nm while the test implants revealed an oxide thickness between 600 and 1000 nm. Routine histological investigations of the tissue reactions around the implants and enzyme histochemical detections of alkaline and acid phosphatase activities demonstrated similar findings around both the control and test implants. In general, the histomorphometrical parameters (bone to implant contact and newly formed bone) revealed significant quantitative differences between the control and test implants. The test implants demonstrated a greater bone response histomorphometrically than control implants and the osteoconductivity was more pronounced around the test implant surfaces. The parameters that differed between the implant surfaces, i.e. the oxide thickness, the pore size distribution, the porosity and the crystallinity of the surface oxides may represent factors that have an influence on the histomorphometrical results indicated by a stronger bone tissue response to the test implant surfaces, with an oxide thickness of more than 600 nm.

The hydrolysis process has been followed by powder X-ray diffraction, infrared absorption and scanning electron microscopy analyses. In the absence of the polyelectrolyte, alpha-TCP undergoes a complete transformation into OCP in 24 h. The presence of polyacrylate in solution inhibits the hydrolysis so that a NaPA concentration of 0.5 mum is sufficient to lengthen the time required to complete the hydrolysis to 4 days. The variation of Ca2+ concentration in the soaking solution suggests that the transformation occurs through alpha-TCP dissolution followed by OCP precipitation. The delayed OCP nucleation and growth in the presence of polyacrylate implies a preferential adsorption of the polyelectrolyte on the growing, OCP crystals, which induces an anisotropic reduction of the coherence lengths of the perfect crystalline domains.

In relation to the radiolucent cement, the addition of zirconium dioxide improved significantly the tensile strength, the fracture toughness and the fatigue crack propagation resistance. In contrast, the addition of barium sulphate produced a decrease of the tensile strength, but did not affect the fracture toughness and improved the crack propagation resistance. When the iodine containing monomer was used, although the tensile strength and the fracture toughness increased, the fatigue crack propagation resistance remained as low as it was for the radiolucent cement.

In this study biopitch, a substitute for fossil pitches in electrodes, was produced from bio-oil distillation in bench-scale equipment. Biopitch and charcoal were mixed and thermically modified to give prebaked electrodes. The physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the biopitch and final electrodes were measured and compared with those of coal tar and petroleum materials. Despite their similar application, biomaterials are structurally and chemically different from minerals. The oxygen content in biopitch is ca 20 wt% and in mineral pitches it is no more than 2 wt%.

In this study, the calcium phosphate formation (in vitro bioactivity) on a sol-gel-derived titania coating was investigated in vitro in a simulated body fluid in the presence and absence of albumin (BSA) and fibrinogen (Fib) in solution as well as the effect of surface immobilized proteins on the biomineralization process. The effect of proteins on calcium phosphate (CP) formation was followed by ion concentration analysis, XRD, SEM-EDX, and XPS. When BSA and Fib were present in solution, the CP layer growth kinetics were strongly retarded. It is suggested that the bone-like apatite formation on sol-gel-derived titania coatings occurs via continuous dissolution/reprecipitation processes, where the initially formed CP phase(s) recrystallizes into a more thermodynamically stable phase(s), as previously observed for other biomaterials. Inhomogeneous charging was observed in the XPS experiments, which could be used to distinguish between an amorphous CP layer and poorly crystalline CP regions.","Abo Akad Univ, Dept Chem Phys, FIN-20500 Turku, Finland; Turku Ctr Biomat, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; Univ Turku, Inst Dent, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; Univ Turku, Dept Appl Phys, Mat Sci Lab, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Areva, S (reprint author), Abo Akad Univ, Dept Chem Phys, Porthansgatan 3-5, FIN-20500 Turku, Finland.",,,,,,,44,49,50,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assays combine RT-PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, thereby eliminating post-PCR processing and potentially enhancing specificity. Consequently, a fluorogenic nuclease RTPCR assay specific for rodent coronaviruses was developed. Primer and probe sequences were selected from the viral genome segment that encodes the membrane (M) protein that is highly conserved among rodent coronaviruses. Use of the fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR detected all strains of MHV and RCV that were evaluated, but did not detect other RNA viruses that naturally infect rodents. Use of the assay detected as little as two femtograms of in vitro transcribed RNA generated from cloned amplicon, and when compared directly with mouse antibody production tests, had similar sensitivity at detecting MHV-A59 in infected cell culture lysates. Finally, use of the assay detected coronavirus RNA in tissues, cage swipes, and feces obtained from mice experimentally infected with MHV, and in tissues and cage swipes obtained from rats naturally infected with RCV. These results indicate that the fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assay should provide a potentially high-throughput, PCR-based method to detect rodent coronaviruses in infected rodents and contaminated biological materials.","Univ Arizona, Dept Univ Anim Care, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Vet Sci & Microbiol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Besselsen, DG (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Univ Anim Care, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,NCRR NIH HHS [R01 RR14072],,,29,12,12,0,0,AMER ASSOC LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE,MEMPHIS,"9190 CRESTWYN HILLS DR, MEMPHIS, TN 38125 USA",1532-0820,,,COMPARATIVE MED,Comparative Med.,APR,2002.0,52,2,,,,,111,116,,,,,,6,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,546TX,WOS:000175291400004,12022389.0,,,,2019-02-25

Porous particles of hydroxyapatite (PPHAP), porous blocks of hydroxyapatite (PBHAP), and LPM did not induce detectable cartilage formation. In straight tunnel structures with various diameters in honeycomb-shaped hydroxyapatite (HCHAP), tunnels with smaller diameters (approximately 0.1 mm) induced cartilage followed by bone formation, while one with a larger diameter (0.35 mm) directly induced bone formation within the tunnels.

Current therapies that use biologically active agents to promote neuronal survival and/or growth have had modest success in allowing injured neurons to regrow through the area of the lesion. Strategies for successful regeneration will require an engineering approach. We propose the design of cell-free grafts of biocompatible materials to build a bridge across the injured area through which axons can regenerate. There are three critical regions of this bridge: the on-ramp, the surface of the bridge itself, and the off-ramp. Each of these regions has specific design requirements, which, if met, can promote regeneration of axons in the injured spinal cord. These requirements, and proposed solutions, are discussed.

It is clear that while postsurgical peritoneal wounds heal without adhesions in some patients, others develop severe scarring from seemingly equal procedures; in addition, in the same patient, adhesions can develop at one surgical site and not in another. The mechanisms underlying the predisposition to form adhesions as well as their site specificity are completely unknown. However, a large number of intraperitoneal surgical procedures are performed each day in the USA, and thus many patients are at risk of developing postoperative adhesions. Therefore, understanding of adhesion formation at the molecular level is essential and in the absence of such information, attempts to prevent patients from developing adhesions will remain an empirical process. The unprecedented advancement in molecular biology during the past decade has led to the identification of many biologically active molecules with the potential of regulating inflammatory and immune responses, angiogenesis and tissue remodeling, events that are central to normal peritoneal wound healing and adhesion formation. Although, the insight into their importance in the development of tissue fibrosis has substantially increased, their major roles in peritoneal biological functions and adhesion formation remain at best speculative. This article reviews the clinical implications of adhesions and attempts to highlight some of the key molecules i.e. growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases and extracellular matrix, that are recognized to regulate inflammation, fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling, events that are central to peritoneal wound repair and adhesion formation. Finally, the article discusses the potential application and site specific delivery of several active compounds that are developed to alter the local inflammatory and immune response i.e., cytokine/chemokine network, targeted gene delivery and development of a new generation of biomaterials to prevent adhesion formation. Such understanding of peritoneal biology not only assist us to better manage patients with adhesion, but also those with endometriosis and malignant diseases that affect the peritoneal cavity.",,"Chegini, N (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Inst Wound Res, Div Reprod Endocrinol & Infertil, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",cheginin@obgyn.ufl.edu,,,,,,219,57,62,0,9,FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE INC,IRVINE,"16471 SCIENTIFIC WAY, IRVINE, CA 92618 USA",1093-9946,1093-4715,,FRONT BIOSCI-LANDMRK,Front.

However, their activity against gram-negative bacteria is not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the adherence, persistence and colonization of Klebsiella pneumoniae on catheter surfaces and also to assess bacteriostatic and bactericidal levels. Design: Randomized, controlled, laboratory study. Setting: University surgical microbiology laboratory. Subjective: Silver sulfadiazine-chlorhexidine impregnated (SSC), minocycline and rifampin bonded (M+R), silver, platinum and carbon incorporated (SP+C) and non-antiseptic central venous catheter segments. Interventions: Catheter segments were immersed in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (0.01 mol/l) with 0.25% dextrose (PBSD) and incubated at 37 degreesC. The PBSD was replaced daily. Effluents were frozen at -70 degreesC for subsequent determination of bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. On days 1,3,7,14 and 21 after initial immersion, 1 ml standardized inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae was added to 90 tubes for a period of 30 min. The inoculum was then replaced with PBSD. One third of the samples were immediately sonicated and plated for the determination of bacterial adherence. The remaining segments were incubated for 4 and 24 h, followed by the same procedure to determine bacterial persistence and colonization with time. All plates were road after 24 h of incubation. Measurements and results: There was a significant reduction in initial bacterial adherence for SP+C catheters on all days (p<0.05). SSC catheters prevented initial bacterial adherence for the first 7 days only (p<0.05). SSC and SP+C catheters prevented bacterial persistence and further colonization on all days. However M+R catheters prevented bacterial colonization for 3 days only. Effluent studies indicated that the impregnated agents in catheter SSC were bactericidal compared to catheter M+R, which were baeteriostatic to K. pneumoniae. No antibacterial activity was detected in the effluents from catheter SP+C. Conclusions: SSC and SP+C catheters are effective in eliminating K. pneumoniae from their surfaces for at least 21 days. M+R catheters are less effective in eliminating bacterial adherence and colonization may be due to their bacteriostatic property.","Hacettepe Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Surg, Surg Microbiol Res Lab, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Trauma & Crit Care, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Yorganci, K (reprint author), GMK Bulvari 129-9 Koz Apt, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,,19,27,27,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0342-4642,,,INTENS CARE MED,Intensive Care Med.,APR,2002.0,28,4,,,,,438,442,,10.1007/s00134-002-1243-4,,,,5,Critical Care Medicine,General & Internal Medicine,552JP,WOS:000175617200011,11967598.0,,,,2019-02-25

Polymerization conditions, including collagen concentration (0.3-3 mg/mL) and pH (6-9), were varied to obtain matrices of collagen fibrils with different microstructures, Confocal reflection microscopy was used to assess specific micro-structural features (e.g,, diameter and length) and organization of component fibrils in 3-D. Microstructural analyses revealed that changes in collagen concentration affected fibril density while maintaining a relatively constant fibril diameter On the other hand, both fibril length and diameter were affected by the pH of the polymerization reaction. Mechanically, all matrices exhibited a similar stress-strain curve with identifiable ""toe,"" ""linear,"" and "",failure "" regions. However, the linear modulus and failure stress increased with collagen concentration and were correlated with an increase in fibril density, Additionally. both the linear modulus and failure stress showed an increase with pH, which was related to air increased fibril length and a decreased fibril diameter The tensile mechanical properties of the collagen matrices also showed strain rate dependence, Such fundamental information regarding the 3-D microstructural-mechanical properties of the ECM and its component molecules are important to our overall understanding of cell-ECM interactions (e.g., mechanotransduction) and the development of novel strategies for tissue repair and replacement.","Purdue Univ, Dept Basic Med Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Purdue Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Voytik-Harbin, SL (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Basic Med Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",blayne@ecn.purdue.edu; kokini@ecn.purdue.edu; jennie@flowcyt.cyto.purdue.edu; jpr@flowcyt.cyto.purdue.edu; voytik@ecn.purdue.edu,"Robinson, Joseph/K-8492-2012","Roeder, Blayne/0000-0003-1998-4372; Robinson, Joseph/0000-0001-8383-3240",,,,40,370,371,2,100,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

A series of dental alloys that are widely used in both countries were chosen. These alloys (five precious, two nonprecious) were wet ground up to 1200 grit SiC, sterilized in 70% ethanol, and extracted in sterile culture medium for 7 days. Pure copper was used as a positive control and Teflon(R) and media only were used as negative controls. Test and control samples were randomized and blinded to each laboratory. Cells, primary human gingival fibroblasts, and immortalized 3T3 fibroblasts, were exposed to the extracts for 24 h. Extract cytotoxicity was evaluated spectrophotometrically with the use of a mitochondrial enzyme activity assay. Data were collected from both laboratories, combined, and subjected to a mixed-model analysis of variance. No statistical difference was obtained for the immortalized 3T3 cells, except for two extracts in which differences between the two labs were significant but were still not cytotoxic. Furthermore, no statistical differences were found for the primary cells. These data strongly suggest that cytotoxicity tests performed in different laboratories with the use of the same test materials may lead to comparable results if sample preparation, cells, test procedures, and data analyses are carefully considered.

Using hemodynamic exposure of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes adherent to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) in vitro, we investigated the role of fluid shear in regulating leukocyte migratory behavior on plasma-adsorbed, prosthetic vascular biomaterial. The presence of flow at a wall shear stress of 25 dyn/cm(2) increased the degree of leukocyte displacement along the flow direction without altering the degree of overall cell attachment. Moreover, plasma-ePTFE elicited a lower overall degree of displacement under flow in comparison with untreated ePTFE. We further probed the molecular level regulation of leukocyte migratory responses under flow through the immunocytochemical quantification of specific leukocyte adhesion molecules and determined that CD43, a cell adhesion molecule, was upregulated via flow exposure for leukocytes adherent to plasma-ePTFE, whereas basal levels of CD43 expression were not significantly altered on untreated ePTFE. When flow-exposed, adherent leukocytes were incubated in the presence of substrate immobilized anti-CD43 immunoglobulin, the degree of cell displacement along flow was found to be significantly enhanced on plasma-cPTFE. Quantification of the cell population redistribution under flow using a modified random motility model, indicated that the incorporation of anti-CD43 on plasma-ePTFE led to a significant increase (243 +/- 60%) in the cell dispersion coefficient, mu(D), whereas only a minimal increase (61 +/- 30%) was detected on non-adsorbed ePTFE. Overall, our results suggest that flow exposure can induce the migration of leukocytes adherent to prosthetic materials in a substrate-dependent manner, An important implication of our study is that, although biomaterials exposed to plasma intrinsically passivate leukocyte migration even under hemodynamic conditions, it may be possible to promote cell motility by targeting a specific, flow-responsive, adhesion molecule.

Heparin and some synthetic water-soluble non-anticoagulant polysaccharides derived from dextran and bearing anionic carboxymethyl and hydrophobic benzylamine groups were first investigated for their effects on EC proliferation in vitro. The results assessed by cell counting, H-3-thymidine uptake, and flow cytometry analysis, showed that the derivatized dextran-bearing hydrophobic groups stimulated the EC growth in the presence of serum, whereas native dextran or dextran-bearing anionic carboxymethyl groups were inactive and heparin was slightly inhibitory. Then, we showed that the derivatized dextran enhanced EC proliferation by potentiation of the mitogenic activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), two potent EC growth factors. In the presence of 2 W of derivatized dextran, a 3-fold and 13-fold increase of H-3-thymidine uptake was obtained with VEGF and FGF-2, respectively. Finally, proliferation of ECs was investigated on crosslinked gels made of polysaccharides. It is of interest that EC proliferation was higher on gels containing the derivatized dextran than on plain hydrogels, and heparinized gels inhibited cell proliferation. From the obtained results, we propose that the synthetic non-heparin-like dextran may be of interest as a coating fur the endothelialization of cardiovascular biomaterials.

The Pluronic can be applied using microfluidic tools or photolithographic techniques, and can be adsorbed to a variety of common surfaces including tissue culture polystyrene, methylated glass, silicone, and polylactic-co-glycolic acid. The effectiveness of the Pluronic in inhibiting cell adhesion in the presence of collagen I is also quantified. Finally, these patterning techniques are generalized to control tissue organization on a variety of common biomaterials.

Nevertheless, biostability and blood compatibility are still among the principal limitations in their long-term application. Studies investigating the development of protective coatings for PEUs have shown that degradation can be reduced with the use of fluorinated surface-modifying macromolecules (SMMs). It has also been hypothesized that SMM-modified PEU surfaces may exhibit improved blood compatibility because other studies have shown a modulation in fibrinogen adsorption onto these surfaces. To determine the blood compatibility of a PEU-containing fluorinated SMMs, a series of in vitro experiments were designed to study the pattern of protein adsorption from plasma and then to assess the nature of platelet adhesion and activation on each substrate. Western blot analysis as well as single protein studies revealed that the dominant ""adhesive proteins"" [fibrinogen (Fg), fibronectin (Fnc), and vitronectin (Vnc)] were adsorbed on two of the SMM-containing PEUs in lower amounts relative to unmodified base. Platelet adhesion and activation data further highlighted the differences among the various substrates. It was shown that the unmodified base had a hi-her number of adhered platelets relative to the SMM-modified surfaces, and that of the SMM-containing substrates, which showed the lowest levels of adhesive proteins also, exhibited significantly lower platelet densities. Close morphological examination further revealed that platelets residing on these latter substrates were not appreciably activated. Based on the current evidence, it is believed that the fluorinated SMMs demonstrate good potential for the development of surfaces with minimal thrombogenic character in in vivo applications.

Surgical implant-centered peritonitis was produced in 180 female CF-1 mice by the direct inoculation of surgical-grade polypropylene mesh disks placed in the peritoneal cavity with lethal doses of either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mice randomly received a resorbable antibody delivery vehicle at the implant site: either a blank carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) aqueous get or the same CMC gel containing 10 mg of pooled polyclonal human immunoglobulin G locally on the implant after infection, either alone or in combination with systemic doses of cefazolin or vancomycin antibiotics. Human antibodies were rapidly released (first-order kinetics) from the gel carrier to both peritoneal fluids and serum in both infection senarios. Inocula required for lethal infection were substantially reduced by surgery and the presence of the implant versus a closed lethal peritonitis model. Survival to 10 days with two different gram-negative P. aeruginosa strains was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) by the direct application of CMC gel containing antibodies alone to the surgical implant site. Human-equivalent doses of systemic vancomycin provided a significantly improved benefit (p < 0.01) against lethal, implant-centered, gram-positive MRSA infection. However, locally delivered polyclonal human antibodies in combination with a range of systemic vancomycin doses against MRSA failed to improve host survival. Successful antibody therapy against gram-negative, implant-centered infections complements the clinically routine use of systemic antibiotics, providing a mechanism of protection independent of antibiotic resistance.

Results from these experiments have clearly demonstrated that the microgravity environment is beneficial in that a number of proteins crystallized were larger and of higher quality than their Earth-grown Counterparts. Improvement in crystal quality is judged by analysis of ultimate diffraction resolution, individual peak mosaicity, and electron density maps. There are now a number of protein crystals that exhibited resolution improvements of 0.5-1.5 Angstrom. Mosaicity Studies revealed dramatic decreases in peak widths for the microgravity-grown crystals. These microgravity results plus data from a variety of other investigators have stimulated Various space agencies to Support fundamental studies in macromolecular crystal growth processes. The CBSE has devoted substantial effort toward the development of dynamically controlled crystal growth systems which allow scientists to optimize crystallization parameters on Earth or in space. These systems enable monitoring and control of the approach to nucleation and post-nucleation growth phases. thereby dramatically improving the crystal size and X-ray diffraction characteristics. The CBSE is Currently designing a complete crystallographic laboratory for the international Space Station including: a crystal growth rack. which Will Support a variety of crystallization hardware systems; an X-ray diffraction rack for crystal characterization or a complete X-ray data set collection: and robotically controlled crystal harvesting/cryopreservation systems that can be operated with minimal crew time via telerobotic and/or robotic procedures.

The biocompatibility of implants is associated with the chemical composition, surface topography, surface energy and surface roughness of biomaterials. The effects of two factors, surface roughness and serum contents, on osteoblast behavior at the surface of Ti-6Al-4V and plasma sprayed HA coating were investigated in the experiment. The osteoblasts derived from neonatal rat calvarial were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with fetal bovine serum (FBS) on the surface of polished Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-p), grit-blasted Tl-6Al-4V (Ti-b), polished HA coating (HAC-p), and as-sprayed HA coating (HAC). Under culture medium containing 4% FIBS, the level of cell attachment to the polished surface is significantly higher than the rough surface of the same experimental materials during all culture periods. Increasing the contents of FBS up to 10%, the difference of osteoblast attachment is not found between Ti-p and Ti-b. Under 4% serum condition, the cell morphology attached to smooth surfaces (Ti-p and HAC-p) is spread faster and are more flattened than the one to rough surface of the same experimental materials by SEM. After 24 h culture, the corroded cracks are easily observed at the surface of polished HA coatings, and the cell morphology on HAC-p coatings are elongated and less flattened compared with Ti-p. The result is consistent with statistical difference of cell attachment between Ti-p and HAC-p under 4% serum condition.

The approach taken relies on the fact that, during the electropolishing of TiC surfaces, the removal of Ti atoms from the TiC surface surpasses that of C atoms. This leads to enrichment of the TiC surface with carbon. Transmission electron microscopic investigation showed that carbon-based films contain carbynes in the form of nanorod-like clusters with lengths in the range of 5-100 nm. This carbyne-containing layer is 50-100 nm thick. It was generalized that carbyne-containing nanofilms are formed on the carbide surface of transition metals of groups IVA-VIA during electropolishing. Since carbynes, being one-dimensional chain-like structures [(-C equivalent to C-)(n)/(=C=C=)(n)] with sp(1) carbon-carbon hybridization, have the highest degree of biocompatibility because of their biological activity, the development of such surface bioengineering with carbynes extends applications of biomaterials based on transition metals of the groups IVA-VIA.","Swinburne Univ Technol, Ind Res Inst Swinburne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Demyashev, GM (reprint author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Ind Res Inst Swinburne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,52,3,3,0,6,AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,STEVENSON RANCH,"25650 NORTH LEWIS WAY, STEVENSON RANCH, CA 91381-1439 USA",1533-4880,,,J NANOSCI NANOTECHNO,J.

A further aim was to compare the cell response on the two materials, currently used in spinal surgery. Cell adhesion was determined after 0.5, 2, 4, and 18 hours of incubation; proliferation after 8, 11, 14, and 16 days of culture; and differentiation was evaluated with the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity after 8 and 16 days of culture. This study showed that bone marrow cells grew faster on titanium alloy than on hydroxyapatite, although fewer cells attached to titanium, compared to those attached to hydroxyapatite. No statistically significant difference was observed as the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity on hydroxyapatite and titanium alloy of the same roughness. Cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation are dependent on surface roughness of the biomaterial, and all three increased as the roughness of titanium alloy increased. Conclusively, surface roughness of titanium and hydroxyapatite significantly influences bone marrow cell response, and therefore these biomaterials should be used with rough outer surface, if a significant cell response on them is desired. These advantages of titanium and hydroxyapatite theoretically seem to be of particular importance in the following situations: long fusions, lumbosacral fusion, revision surgery with poor bone bank, neuropathic scoliosis associated with few bone graft reserves, and adult patients with severe osteoporosis.","Gen Hosp Agios Andreas, Dept Orthopaed, Spine Unit, Patras, Greece; Univ Patras, Dept Mech & Aeronaut Engn, Biomed Engn Lab, GR-26110 Patras, Greece; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, St Louis, MO USA","Korovessis, PG (reprint author), Gen Hosp Agios Andreas, Dept Orthopaed, Spine Unit, 65-67 Haralabi Str, Patras, Greece.",,,,,,,31,26,26,1,9,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1536-0652,,,J SPINAL DISORD TECH,J.

Adequate biomaterial biocompatibility is necessary for successful urinary reconstruction. In this study using a primary normal human bladder smooth muscle cell culture system we evaluated the in vitro biocompatibility of a number of naturally derived biomaterials, including bladder submucosa, small intestinal submucosa, collagen and alginate, and polymeric biomaterials, including polyglycolic acid, poly(L-lactic acid) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid, which have been used for urinary reconstruction experimentally or clinically. Materials and Methods: To determine the cytotoxic and bioactive effects of bladder submucosa, small intestinal submucosa, collagen, alginate, polyglycolic acid, poly(L-lactic acid) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) we measured cell viability, metabolic activity, apoptotic properties and DNA synthesis activity with 4 types of assays, namely Neutral Red (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri), 3-(4,5-dimethyltliiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (Sigma Chemical Co.), apoptotic activity and tritiated thymidine incorporation (Dupont NEN, Boston, Massachusetts) assays. Normal human bladder smooth muscle cells were cultured with the extracts of the biomaterials or cultured in direct contact with the biomaterials. Results: All naturally derived and synthetic biomaterials tested in this study except alginate exhibited nontoxic and bioactive effects on human bladder smooth muscle cells (HBSMCs) in vitro, as indicated by the 4 types of biocompatibility assays using the extract and direct contact methods. Cell viability, apoptotic properties, metabolic activity and DNA synthesis activity of HBSMCs cultured with the extracts of the biomaterials or cultured in direct contact with the biomaterials were not significantly different from those of negative controls (fresh medium with no extracts or tissue culture plates without biomaterials). Conclusions: All naturally derived and synthetic biomaterials tested in this study except alginate exhibited nontoxic and bioactive effects on HBSMCs in vitro. This normal primary human bladder smooth muscle cell culture model is suitable for in vitro biocompatibility assessment.

Diagnosis of infection based on pathogen detection is difficult and exacerbated by increasing numbers of partially or totally resistant strains of nosocomial pathogens, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. Expression profiling of a host's cellular immune response could facilitate the identification of the pathways involved in pathogen recognition and eradication and could lead to more rational design of drugs and therapies. To this end, we constructed and characterized ten individually tagged and directionally cloned cDNA libraries from peripheral blood cells (PBC), spleen (Sp), thymus (Th), lymph node (LN), and bone marrow (BM) from immunologically naive and challenged pigs as part of an implant-associated orthopedic model of deep infection. Three of these libraries were normalized at C, values 5, 10, 20, and 30. The libraries comprise more than 20 million primary transformants with an average insert length >1.4 kb. Cluster analysis of 7620 ESTs revealed 1029 clusters containing an average of 3.6 sequences and 3846 singletons. Gene discovery is estimated to be similar to64%. Searches of public databases resulted in 49.3% annotated porcine sequences, of which 22.2% had significant homologies to ESTs from a variety of species, and 28.5% were without a significant match in any public database.

A series of stress-relaxation tests was conducted for each specimen from 5% strain up to 20% strain with 5% intervals. The stress-relaxation was monitored over a period of 5 min. Each region exhibited a different biomechanical behavior, which is presumably related to the organization and distribution of proteoglycans that indirectly modulate the stiffness of the collagen network.

Experiments were performed to gain insight on the chemical groups that may be involved in the binding of Cu ions. We have taken advantage of physical/chemical tools, which allowed us to identify these groups at the atomic level. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was utilized to determine the Cu ion binding capacity of the two biomaterials as a function of pH. Both biomaterials showed a substantial amount of Cu ion binding at pH 5 (26.8 mg/g of biomass for the whole cell group and 90.4 mg/g for the cell wall group). X-Ray absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the speciation of Cu ions bound by cell wall and whole cell materials as well as to elucidate which functional groups were involved in binding of the Cu ions. X-Ray absorption near-edge spectra showed that the majority of the Cu was bound in both biomaterials as Cu(II) and also suggested that Cu(II) ions are binding to oxygen ligands in an environment resembling that of Cu(II) acetate monohydrate.

They result often from a specific treatment of the interface of the material. Techniques like physisorption, covalent binding or deposition of a Langmuir-Blodgett film have been employed to modify surface properties. We describe here a novel approach based upon an alternated adsorption of polyelectrolytes (polyanions or polycations) leading to the build-up of a film. These films can be functionnalized through protein insertion (ligands) or by covalent peptide bindings able to interact with cellular receptors, Combined with a high affinity for calcium or phosphate complexing properties such functionnalized architectures could constitute an original way to favour osseointegration.

Constituent elements are important in determining the biocompatibility and corrosion resistance of a biomaterial implant. The focus of this article is on the application of ion beam analysis towards quantifying the composition of calcium phosphate based biomaterials. Thin films of calcium phosphate bioceramics were prepared on Si and Ti substrates using ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) and ion beam assisted sputter deposition (IBASD) methods. Precise amounts of calcium, phosphorus, oxygen and hydrogen in these thin films are determined by combining four ion beam analysis techniques. The simultaneous application of proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) were utilized to quantify composition and amounts of elements heavier than helium. Elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) was used to determine hydrogen content while resonance-enhanced RBS (RE-RBS) was utilized to measure oxygen concentration. The amount of assisting ion beam current density during deposition affected the concentration ratios of Ca, O and H to P. Combination of different ion beam analysis methods is useful in characterizing the elemental composition and distribution of composite biomaterials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Substantial progress has been made in the development of novel biomaterial scaffolds and in the genetic manipulation of cells in vitro. Moreover, certain aspects of tissue engineering strategies have begun to undergo clinical trial. A glimpse of tissue engineering in China was afforded at the First International Conference on Biomaterials (China) held in Beijing, July 24-26, 2001. Several papers presented at the meeting, which was conducted in English only, reflected many of the tissue engineering activities in the country. A brief summary of some of the papers may begin to suggest possibilities for collaboration between tissue engineers inside and outside of China, as well as to facilitate dissemination of important findings.","Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; W China Univ Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Univ Hosp 1, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Spector, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, MRB 106,75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,"Spector, Myron/0000-0003-3328-4858",,,,18,0,0,0,1,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,APR,2002.0,8,2,,,,,169,174,,10.1089/107632702753724941,,,,6,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,549KN,WOS:000175443200001,12031107.0,,,,2019-02-25

This article reviews the various common plasma techniques and experimental methods as applied to biomedical materials research, such as plasma sputtering and etching, plasma implantation, plasma deposition, plasma polymerization, laser plasma deposition, plasma spraying, and so on. The unique advantage of plasma modification is that the surface properties and biocompatibility can be enhanced selectively while the bulk attributes of the materials remain unchanged. Existing materials can, thus, be used and needs for new classes of materials may be obviated thereby shortening the time to develop novel and better biomedical devices. Recent work has spurred a number of very interesting applications in the biomedical field. This review article concentrates upon the current status of these techniques, new applications, and achievements pertaining to biomedical materials research.

The cells were seeded at low density onto the materials under investigation and allowed to grow for 2 weeks. They then were analyzed for morphology, proliferation, viability, alkaline phosphatase activity (A-P), osteocalcin (OC) production, and extracellular matrix mineralization. The results showed that all materials have good biocompatibility. Cell viability tests demonstrated that in all cases the values were comparable to the control, and the addition of hydroxyapatite always resulted in an enhancement of performance with respect to the plain polymer. AP and OC analysis confirmed that all composites allowed the expression of phenotypic markers.

In particular, extracellular matrix proteins-which interact specifically with integrin adhesion receptors on the cell surface-can stimulate initial cell attachment by serving both as a ligand for receptor-mediated attachment and as a stimulant of focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Consequently, the strength of cell adhesion should depend both on the strength of cell/surface contacts and cytoskeleton-dependent properties of the cell (i.e., morphology, compliance). To examine this dual role of extracellular matrix proteins, murine fibroblasts were seeded onto self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of dodecanethiolate coated with 0 to 0.45 mug/cm(2) of fibronectin (Fn) and then detached by hydrodynamic shear using a radial-flow chamber (RFC). Cell adhesion was characterized in terms of the critical wall shear stress for detachment (tau (wc)), and the compliance was evaluated from measurements of cell displacement and elongation as a function of the fibronectin concentration. Critical wall shear stress and cell displacement were found to be insensitive to Fn at concentrations below 0.23 mug/cm(2) while above this threshold tau (wc) increased and displacement decreased with increasing Fn concentration. Elongation of the cells in the direction of flow was independent of Fn concentration, but correlated linearly with tau (wc) for Fn densities below 0.23 mug/cm(2). These studies show that Fn concentration affects both tau (wc) and cell displacement under shear, and that tau (wc) is sensitive to cell compliance. In addition, they suggest that the dominant mechanism of cell detachment from hydrophobic substrates involves cell displacement.

Structure-function relationships were studied for all derivatives and revealed a decrease in activity of more than 90% as compared to unprotected r-hirudin. MALDI-TOF MS was used to determine the locations of the Msc groups. Furthermore, evidence was provided that r-hirudin's N-terminal amino group is highly important for its anti-thrombin activity.

The rates of enzymatic reactions depend on many factors, the molecular mobility of the reactants and the properties of the matrices in which they are embedded (pH, viscosity, ionic strength) being often controlling aspects. The objective of present work was to investigate beta-galactosidase activity as affected by pH-moisture dependence and by physical properties of the matrix in reduced moisture systems of whey (W) and dextranes (Dx). Beta-galactosidase from 3 different sources, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus oryzae, and Saccharomyces lactis, were tested. Beta-galactosidase activity from S. lactis was reduced in W systems. pH-moisture dependence was proposed as the main cause of this low activity. The decrease of apparent pH upon water removal and the molecular mobility of the polymeric matrix, and of the enzyme, which is related to their size, appear to be more significant factors than the actual value of the glass transition temperature (T-5) of the matrix on beta-galactosidase activity.

A new methodology is described for the determination of the reactivity ratios based on the quantitative in situ NMR analysis in the course of the copolymerization reaction. The methodology uses the continuous change of the intensity of resonance signals assigned unambiguously to the monomers participating in the polymerization reaction with the reaction time at a given temperature. The evaluation of the monomer concentrations leads to the determination of the instantaneous feed molar fractions and the reactivity ratios, by using a solution of the differential copolymerization equation which describes the terminal model described by Mayo and Lewis. Two approaches to obtain the reactivity ratios by nonlinear fitting of the experimental data to this integrated form are described. The first incorporates the initial conditions as third parameter in the optimization (the values obtained are r(HEMA) = 6.81 and r(AMPS) = 0.116 for the HEMA-AMPS system and r(DMAA) = 1.50 and rAMPS = 0.40 for DMAA-AMPS), and the second uses different points as initial conditions in the integrated equation (obtaining r(DMAA) = 1.53 and r(AMPS) = 0.36, in very good agreement with the obtained by the first method). These values are in good agreement with those described in the literature and with data for copolymers prepared at low conversion analyzed by standard methods.","Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Polimeros, Madrid 28006, Spain","Gallardo, A (reprint author), Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Polimeros, Juan Cierva 3, Madrid 28006, Spain.",,"Fernandez-Gutierrez, Mar/D-3860-2014; Aguilar, Maria Rosa/C-2593-2014; Gallardo, Alberto/B-4794-2011","Fernandez-Gutierrez, Mar/0000-0003-1739-1987; Aguilar, Maria Rosa/0000-0001-7395-5754; Gallardo, Alberto/0000-0003-4614-4299",,,,28,52,52,2,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,MAR 12,2002.0,35,6,,,,,2036,2041,,10.1021/ma0106907,,,,6,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,531XD,WOS:000174441800010,,,,,2019-02-25

The foundations, evolution, and impact of biomedical surface science are discussed. In the 19th century, the first observations were made that surfaces control biological reactions. The advancements in surface science instrumentation that have occurred in the past quarter of a century have significantly increased our ability to characterize the surface composition and molecular structure of biomaterials. Similar advancements have occurred in material science and molecular biology. The combination of these advances have allowed the development of the biological model for surface science, where the ultimate goal is to gain a detailed understanding of how the surface properties of a material control the biological reactivity of a cell interacting with that surface. Numerous examples show that the surface properties of a material are directly related to in vitro biological performance such as protein adsorption and cell growth. The challenge is to fully develop the biological model for surface science in the highly complex and interactive in vivo biological environment. Examples of state-of-the-art biomedical surface science studies on surface chemical state imaging, molecular recognition surfaces, adsorbed protein films, and hydrated surfaces are presented. Future directions and opportunities for surface scientists working in biomedical research include exploiting biological knowledge, biomimetics, precision immobilization, self-assembly, nanofabrication, smart surfaces, and control of non-specific reactions.

Moreover, materials scientists are also increasingly deriving new lessons from naturally occurring materials (from mollusk shells to soft animal tissue) about useful composition-structure property relationships that might be mimicked with synthetic materials. Together, these two areas of effort constitute what we may call bioengineered materials. It is possible to set down a reasonably thorough set of characteristics that bioengineered materials have in common. Among these characteristics we discuss the following: self-assembly, bioengineered materials often rely on information content built into structural molecules to determine the order and organization of the material; hierarchical structure, in most bioengineered materials several different length scales of structure are essential and are formed spontaneously and simultaneously via self-assembly; precision synthesis, fundamental to biological material structures is the idea of macromolecules constructed in a precise manner; templating, ordered structures in bioengineered materials are often propagated from one element or set of instructions, to another; specific and non-specific interactions, the forces involved in holding biomaterials structures together. In the future, a carefully selected combination of this set of characteristics will enable us to bioengineer surfaces that are capable to direct and control a desired biological response. Eventually, such bioengineered surfaces will become important tools to comprehend and analyze how materials interact in nature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Six examples are used to introduce and discuss the subject: Medical implants in the human body, biosensors and biochips for diagnostics, tissue engineering, bioelectronics, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic materials. They are areas of varying maturity, together constituting a strong driving force for the current rapid development of BioSS. The second driving force is the purely scientific challenges and opportunities to explore the mutual interaction between biological components and surfaces. Model systems range from the unique water structures at solid surfaces and water shells around proteins and biomembranes, via amino and nucleic acids, proteins, DNA, phospholipid membranes. to cells and living tissue at surfaces. At one end of the spectrum the scientific challenge is to map out the structures, bonding, dynamics and kinetics of biomolecules at surfaces in a similar way as has been done for simple molecules during the past three decades in surface science. At the other end of the complexity spectrum one addresses how biofunctional surfaces participate in and can be designed to constructively participate in the total communication system of cells and tissue. Biofunctional surfaces call for advanced design and preparation in order to match the sophisticated (bio) recognition ability of biological systems. Specifically this requires combined topographic, chemical and visco-clastic patterns on surfaces to match proteins at the nm scale and cells at the micrometer scale. Essentially all methods of surface science are useful. High-resolution (e.g. scanning probe) microscopies. spatially resolved and high sensitivity, non-invasive optical spectroscopies, self-organizing monolayers, and nano- and microfabrication are important for BioSS. However, there is also a need to adopt or develop new methods for studies of biointerfaces in the native, liquid state. For the future it is likely that BioSS will have an even broader definition than above and include native interfaces, and that combinations of molecular (cell) biology and BioSS will contribute to the understanding of the ""living state"".

This study was aimed at understanding and controlling mineral formation in a poly(alpha-hydroxy ester) model system, to gain insight into biological mineralization processes and to develop biomaterials for orthopaedic tissue regeneration. We specifically hypothesized that providing a high surface density of anionic functional groups would enhance nucleation and growth of bonelike mineral following exposure to simulated body fluids (SBF). Polymer surface functionalization was achieved via hydrolysis of 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) films. This treatment led to an increase in surface carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups, resulting in a substantial increase in polymer surface energy from 42 to 49 dynes/cm(2). Treated polymers exhibited a 3-fold increase in heterogeneous mineral grown and growth of a continuous mineral film on the polymer surface. The mineral grown on PLG surfaces is a carbonate apatite, the major mineral component of vertebrate bone tissue. Mineral crystal size and morphology were dependent on the solution characteristics but unaffected by the degree of surface prehydrolysis. The mechanism of heterogeneous carbonate apatite growth was examined via ion binding assays, which indicated that calcium binding is mediated independently by the presence of soluble phosphate counterions and surface functional groups, These findings indicate that poly(alpha-hydroxy ester) materials can be readily mineralized using a biomimetic process, and that the impetus for mineral nucleation in this system appears more complicated than the simple electrostatic interactions proposed in previous biomineralization theory.","Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Mooney, DJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, 5213 Dent,1011 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Murphy, William/I-4096-2014; Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771",NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM 08353]; NIDCR NIH HHS [R01 DE13033],,,41,223,227,7,106,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Methods to maintain the propagating signals solely at the optical level must be developed to overcome the transmission capacities and speed limits imposed by the electronic components. We have demonstrated that molecular switches can be used to gate optical signals in response to optical signals. We have realized a simple optical network consisting of three light sources, one cell containing a solution of three fluorescent molecules, one cell containing a solution of a three-state molecular switch and a detector. The light emitted by the three fluorophores is absorbed by the three states of the molecular switch. Using this simple operating principle, we have shown that multichannel digital transmission can be implemented on an ensemble of communicating molecules relying exclusively on the interplay of optical inputs and optical outputs.","Univ Miami, Dept Chem, Ctr Supramol Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA","Raymo, FM (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Chem, Ctr Supramol Sci, 1301 Mem Dr, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",,"Giordani, Silvia/C-5343-2009","Giordani, Silvia/0000-0002-9212-5067",,,,53,138,139,0,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

A stereological approach was used to analyze the morphological properties of the macroporous hydrogels by relating the morphological properties of thin sections to the original three-dimensional macroporous hydrogel. Prepared macroporous hydrogels had porosities between 0.43 +/- 0.08 and 0.84 +/- 0.02 and surface area densities between 55 ::L 3 and 108 ::E 7 cm(-1). Sodium bicarbonate concentration had the greatest effect on both the porosity and surface area density. The effect of copolymer formulation on the porosity and surface area density was insignificant. From thin sections, of the macroporous hydrogels, the profile size distributions were determined as an estimate of the pore size distribution. Two formulations synthesized with varying L-ascorbic acid concentration of 0.05 and 0.1 M had median profile sizes of 50-100 and 150-200 mum, respectively. This novel synthesis method allows for the in situ cross-linking of biodegradable macroporous hydrogels with morpholological properties suitable for consideration as an injectable tissue engineering scaffold.","Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77251 USA; Rice Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Houston, TX 77251 USA","Mikos, AG (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, MS-142,POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",mikos@rice.edu,,"Zygourakis, Kyriacos/0000-0002-1044-1139",NIDCR NIH HHS [R01-DE13031],,,37,111,111,1,25,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,MAR-APR,2002.0,3,2,,,,,374,381,,10.1021/bm010158r,,,,8,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,532AN,WOS:000174449600022,11888325.0,,,,2019-02-25

The underlying concept is that collagen-immobilization will improve the tissue integration. Since the method of collagen-immobilization involves the covalent coupling of collagen to an acrylic acid (AA) based surface graft, both non-modified PU and PU-AA were used as controls. Bare PU has a flat surface, whereas both PU-AA and PU-CI displayed a slightly roughened surface. Implantation showed that PU-CI induced early after implantation a far more intense foreign body reaction than PU and PU-AA. This reaction consisted of increased presence of fibrin, granulocytes and macrophages. Roughening of the surface as with PU-AA induced only a small increase in fibrin formation and cellular migration. At day 5 the reaction to PU-CI had slowed down; giant cell formation now slowly started but was decreased compared to PU and PU-AA. At day 10 capsules around each type of material looked similar, but in contrast to PU, PU-CI films could no longer be dissected from their capsules. Only at week 3 this also occurred with PU, at which time point again similar capsules with the three materials were observed. At week 6, of the three materials PU-CI showed the thinnest capsule with most immediate adherence of connective tissue. These results show that collagen-immobilization of PU increased the early tissue reaction and therefore the tissue integration. The thin capsule observed at 6 weeks may be beneficial in e.g. infectious circumstances, when easy access for immune reactions is needed. This, and the long-term performance of PU-CI will be a matter of future investigations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this paper, the antimicrobial activity of silicone rubber with a covalently coupled 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (QAS) coating was studied in vitro and in vivo. Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH2 102, and Gram-negative Escherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 were seeded on silicone rubber with and without QAS-coating, in the absence or presence of adsorbed human plasma proteins. The viability of the adherent bacteria was determined using a live/dead fluorescent stain and a confocal laser scanning microscope. The coating reduced the viability of adherent staphylococci from 90% to 0%, and of Gram-negative bacteria from 90% to 25%, while the presence of adsorbed plasma proteins had little influence. The biomaterials were also subcutaneously implanted in rats for 3 or 7 days, while pre- or postoperatively seeded with S. aureus ATCC 12600. Preoperative seeding resulted in infection of 7 out of 8 silicone rubber implants against 1 out of 8 QAS-coated silicone rubber implants. Postoperative seeding resulted in similar infection incidences on both implant types, but the numbers of adhering bacteria were 70% lower on QAS-coated silicone rubber. In conclusion, QAS-coated silicone rubber shows antimicrobial properties against adhering bacteria, both in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The first scaffold, based on a hyaluronic acid derivative, was observed to be non-adhesive for REC. This lack of adhesion was found to be unrelated to the presence of the hyaluronic acid binding domain on the surface of isolated REC. The other scaffold, consisting of equine collagen, was observed to encourage REC spreading and adhesion. Positive Ulex Europaeus agglutinin (UEA) lectin staining of this preparation indicated the presence of ciliated REC on the scaffold surface. However, the marked decrease in peanut agglutinin (PNA) positive staining, relative to that of control cultures and native tissue, indicates a dedifferentiation of the secretory cells of the REC monolayer. SEM analysis of REC cultured on the collagen scaffold confirmed the presence of ciliated cells thereby validating the UEA positive staining. The presence of both established and developing cilia was also verified. This study indicates that collagen biomaterials are appropriate for the tissue engineering of REC. Furthermore, that UEA and PNA staining is a useful tool in the characterisation of cells cultured on biomaterials, therefore helpful in identifying biomaterials that are suitable for specific tissue engineering purposes.

The aim of this study was to screen the cytotoxicity and evaluate starch-based polymers and composites as potential biomaterials. The biocompatibility of two different blends of corn-starch, starch/ethylene vinyl alcohol (SEVA-C) and starch/cellulose acetate (SCA), and their respective composites with hydroxyapatite (HA) was assessed by cytotoxicity and cell adhesion tests. The MTT assay was performed with the extracts of the materials in order to evaluate the short-term effect of the degradation products. The cell morphology of L929 mouse fibroblast cell line was also analysed after direct contact with polymers and composites for different time periods and the number of cells adhered to the surface of the polymers was determined by quantification of the cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Both types of starch-based polymers exhibit a cytocompatibility that might allow for their use as biomaterials. SEVA-C blends were found to be the less cytotoxic for the tested cell line, although cells adhere better to SCA surface. The cytotoxicity test also revealed that SCA and SEVA-C composites have a similar response to the one obtained for SCA polymer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that cells were much more spread on the SCA polymer and LDH measurements showed a higher number of cells on this surface.

Aim of this study was to explore whether the direct contact with biomaterial substrata of different chemical nature could influence bacterial behaviour, determining possible changes in the bacteria population as far as antibiotic resistance is concerned. To this end, susceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefamandole, imipenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, cefazolin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, amikacin and netilmicin was evaluated in a methicillin-, gentamicin- and tobramycin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strain, after in vitro adhesion to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and to silicone elastomer. The susceptibility to antibiotics of both adherent bacteria and bacteria which, although exposed to the materials, had not undergone adhesion was measured as bacterial growth inhibition area onto a plate antibiogram, according to Kirby-Bauer and using an image analyser system. The results obtained suggest that the two test materials considered in this study were capable to condition bacterial behaviour. In particular, the adhesion onto PMMA surfaces induced a marked and significant decrease in susceptibility to the following beta-lactam antibiotics: cefamandole (32%), cefazolin (23%), imipenem (27%), ampicillin (31%). Moreover, PMMA caused a lower but significant reduction in resistance to vancomycin (15%), chloramphenicol (16%), amikacin (13%), netilmicin (13%), erythromycin (11%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (13%). In contrast, the adhesion onto silicone elastomer appeared to influence bacterial changes to a lesser extent and elicited a significant decrease in susceptibility only to cefazolin (10%) and amikacin (11%). Further studies are required to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms of these variations, even though, also according to other authors, one of the best conceivable conclusions is that some material substrata can lead to selection of variant adhesive bacteria with increased antibiotic resistance.

It was observed that hepatocytes (HepG2, human hepatoma cell line) and fibroblasts (1,929, murine cell line) exhibit strong adhesion on the irradiated polymer surfaces. Masked irradiations opened a simple, fast, and economical route to obtain chemically patterned polymeric substrates for structured cell adhesion. This is more advantageous as compared to silane based patterning techniques on glass or thiol based patterning on gold due to the elimination of any chemical treatment, the clean room compatibility and the small size of achieved structures.

In a novel assay, bacterial suspensions were placed into narrow 20-mul conical cavities within the materials. After 0, 4, 8, 24, 48 h and 1 week of incubation, the suspensions were removed from the restoratives and the numbers of viable bacteria were determined. After incubation periods of 8 h or more, all restorative materials except the FH-RC showed significant growth inhibition when compared with controls. The strongest antibacterial activity was observed with ZOE. The inhibitory effect of Ariston pHc was similar to that of the SC-GIC and the RM-GIC. In the second assay, growth inhibition was evaluated in liquid cultures by incubating eluates of the materials with suspensions of S. mutans. Bacterial growth was determined up to 6 h by measuring absorption at 600 nm. The most marked inhibitory effect was again observed with ZOE. The SC-GIC caused a significant inhibition at all time intervals but the FH-RC, the RM-GIC and Ariston pHc exhibited no significant antibacterial effects. It is recommended to employ more than one method for assessing the antibacterial potential of restorative materials. Long-term clinical trials are necessary to determine whether the antimicrobial effects of dental materials are able to reduce the risk of secondary caries formation. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

While Ti was soaked in tantalum-free hydrogen peroxide solution followed by aging in hydrogen peroxide solution containing tantalum ions, titania films with well-crystallized anatase were obtained. The crystalline titania resulted from crystallization of the previously deposited amorphous gel. Addition of tantalum ions in hydrogen peroxide solutions helps to obtain the crystalline titania and favors especially the formation of rutile phase.","Okayama Univ, Fac Engn, Biomat Lab, Okayama 7008530, Japan; Zhejiang Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China","Wu, JM (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Fac Engn, Biomat Lab, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",,"Wu, Jin-Ming/B-4124-2009; HAYAKAWA, Satoshi/B-2104-2011","Wu, Jin-Ming/0000-0001-7157-8465; HAYAKAWA, Satoshi/0000-0002-1097-8614",,,,16,20,22,1,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1528-7483,,,CRYST GROWTH DES,Cryst.

METHODS: Male athymic (nude) mice underwent a midline abdominal incision followed by an intraperitoneal inoculation of KM12-L4 human colon cancer cells. Seprafilm(R) membrane was placed under the incision or on the right lateral abdominal wall control groups received no Seprafilm(R) membrane. In another group, Vicryl(TM) mesh was placed on the right lateral abdominal wall and removed after I minute to control for surgical trauma associated with biomaterial placement. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal Seprafilm did not affect human colon cancer tumor metastasis, including the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes. The application of a biomaterial such as Seprafilm(R) or Vicryl(TM) mesh to the peritoneal sidewall away from the midline wound was associated with in increased rate of local tumor growth. This was Likely because of the local trauma of biomaterial placement in the nude mouse model and not because of the presence of a foreign material. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Seprafilm(R) does not affect tumor metastasis. Additionally, placement of biomaterials may cause local trauma that stimulates the formation of localized sidewall tumors in the nude mouse model. Further studies in other animal models and ultimately, in humans are required to unambiguously understand the safety of Seprafilm(R) and other biomaterials in cancer patients.","Genzyme Corp, Biomat & Surg Prod Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Burns, JW (reprint author), Genzyme Corp, Biomat & Surg Prod Res Lab, 1 Kendall Sq, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,24,18,20,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0012-3706,1530-0358,,DIS COLON RECTUM,Dis.

DNA has few commercial uses and is generally discarded as an industrial waste. Recently, we prepared water-insoluble and nuclease-resistant DNA-films by UV irradiation. The DNA-films removed DNA-intercalating compounds. Here, we immobilized double-stranded DNA onto porous glass beads by UV irradiation and prepared DNA-immobilized glass bead columns. The DNA-immobilized columns effectively accumulated more DNA-intercalating materials than the DNA-films. The DNA-immobilized columns bound endocrine disruptors with a planar structure, such as dioxin-derivatives, polychlorobiphenyl (PCB)-derivatives, and benzo[a]pyrene. Bisphenol A and diethylstilbestrol, which lack a planar structure, did not bind to the DNA-immobilized columns. These results suggest that DNA-immobilized glass bead columns could selectively remove chemical compounds with a planar structure by intercalation into the double-stranded DNA. DNA-immobilized glass beads and DNA-films prepared by UV irradiation have the potential to serve as useful biomaterials for medical, engineering, and environmental applications.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Lab Biomat Chem, Div Biosci,Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Nishi, N (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Lab Biomat Chem, Div Biosci,Kita Ku, Kita-10,Nishi-5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",,"Ohkawa, Kousaku/E-1497-2014","Ohkawa, Kousaku/0000-0001-5199-092X",,,,32,78,82,1,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

To get a fuller understanding of the scope of responses effected by nanotopography on cells, many genes need to be surveyed. Recent developments in molecular biology have lead to the commercial production of microarrays. Microarray presents a powerful tool by which many genes (up to many thousands) can be probed simultaneously. In this study, 1718 gene arrays have been used to measure human fibroblast response to 13-nm-high polymer demixed islands. The results have shown many changes in genes involved in signaling, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, gene transcription, and protein translation; these results have been used to build a more complete overview of fibroblast response to the islands.

Digits with pHEMA-only, standard tendon sheath repair, and with no sheath repair were the controls. Over 12 weeks the CS-coated membranes were evaluated for joint flexion, adhesion limitation, and tendon healing progress. The membranes initially allowed for better flexion (i.e, for 6 weeks), but their relative superior effectiveness faded afterward. Histology showed that adhesions were less severe and healing was better in the CS-pHEMA membranes at 3 and 6 weeks. If further studies determine precise amounts or thicknesses of CS coats that will maximize its healing properties, CS-pHEMA should prove useful in clinical settings in which restoration of tendon sheath integrity with a minimum of adhesions is not possible.

The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14), the elastic constant s(55), and the dielectric permittivity epsilon(11) were measured for the anionic and native collagen films. It was observed that the collagen samples submitted to the alkaline treatment present lower thermal stability than those made from native collagen. However, the treated samples present a higher piezoelectricity compared with the native collagen. The frequency constant fL and the piezoelectric strain element d(14), obtained for the alkaline-treated sample (72 h), present the highest values for the samples under study (444.1 kHz m and 0.079 pC/N, respectively). We believe that the alkaline treatment led to an increase of the organization of the microscopic fiber structure of the sample, which could result in an increase of the piezoelectricity.

Ultra high resolution electron microscopy (UHREM) is a powerful technique to discriminate the species of atoms which are located closer within 0.1 mu, and therefore light elements such as nitrogen and oxygen can be directly observed in the structure image. Low electron dose HREM can be applied to characterize soft ceramics such as zeolite and biomaterials by using slow-scan CCD camera system. High spatial resolution analytical transmission electron microscopy (AEM) can be materialized by designing the pole-piece with small gap and large solid angle for X-ray detector. The chemical composition and chemical bonding state in the very narrow region less than 1 nm can be analyzed by using the present pole-piece with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a field-emission TEM (FE-TEM). Ultra high temperature in-situ observation is performed using special laser beating holder. Sintering behavior of zirconia ultra fine particles, and chemical reaction of zirconia and silica are directly observed by TEM in-situ heating experiment. In addition, in-situ straining observation is possible to observe crack propagation in alumina ceramics by using the crack induced tension (CIT) method which is driven by piezo actuator or micro-step motor. On the basis of the newly developed TEM methods demonstrated here, an concept of ""Active-Nano Characterization and Technology"" were proposed.","Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Res, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Ikuhara, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Res, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",ikuhara@sigma.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ikuhara, Yuichi/N-1001-2015; Ikuhara, Yuichi/F-3066-2010","Ikuhara, Yuichi/0000-0003-3886-005X; ",,,,21,6,6,0,5,CERAMIC SOC JAPAN-NIPPON SERAMIKKUSU KYOKAI,TOKYO,"22-17, HYAKUNIN-CHO 2-CHOME, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 169-0073, JAPAN",1882-0743,1348-6535,,J CERAM SOC JPN,J.

The situation for integration of biomaterials is more difficult in the semiopen implantation site middle ear than in other parts of the body. Important for integration is the contact of the biomaterial's surface toward proteins. Studies of the integration in living tissue still have to be performed in animal experiments. Morphological examinations of explanted prostheses after clinical use complete the picture of an ossicular replacement material. Methods: Preclinical studies where performed to compare the adsorption behaviour of titanium, stainless steel and aluminum oxide toward radioactive marked albumin and native collagen type 1. An animal model in the rabbit was performed to study the integration of titanium in the middle ear morphologically. Middle ear prostheses removed during revision surgery were studied as well. Results: Titanium showed an adsorption amount of 360 mug/cm(2), stainless steel of 230 mug/cm(2) and aluminum oxide of 500 mug/cm(2) out of an albumin solution of 400 mg/ml. Comparing desorption the mean loss was 16% for titanium, 21% for stainless steel and 23% for aluminium oxide. Reassembled collagen fibrils could be detected after adsorption in collagen typ I solution by means of scanning electron microscopy. Morphological studies in animal experiments showed regular healing after implantation. Explanted prostheses from humans did not show any cellular signs of repulsion. Conclusion: The results of preclinical studies and clinical use demonstrate titanium as a useful material for ossicular reconstruction in middle ear surgery.","Univ Wurzburg, Klin & Poliklin Hals Nasen Ohrenkranke, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany","Schwager, K (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Klin & Poliklin Hals Nasen Ohrenkranke, Josef Schneider Str 11, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany.",,,,,,,46,19,19,1,3,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",1615-0007,,,LARYNGO RHINO OTOL,Laryngo-Rhino-Otol.,MAR,2002.0,81,3,,,,,178,183,,10.1055/s-2002-25037,,,,6,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,540MD,WOS:000174932000004,11967769.0,,,,2019-02-25

E PATIENTS AND METHODS: This matched, retrospective, case-control study was based on diagnosis, number of previous operations, and age. There were 30 patients in each group and only patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up were included. Double-plate Molteno or Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion was performed on each patient to control intractable glaucoma. Success was defined as IOP <22 mm Hg and >4 mm Hg on the last two visits, a decrease of no more than 2 lines in the visual acuity, and no additional surgical intervention to control IOP. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of success at 12 and 24 months was 73% and 56% with DPM and 60% and 50% for AGV (P = 0.72). Mean IOP measured 13.36 +/- 5.2 mm Hg following DPM and 16.7 +/- 5.6 mm Hg following AGV at 12 months (P = 0.026) and 13.3 +/- 5.1 mm Hg with DPM and 19 +/- 5.8 mm Hg with AGV at 24 months (P = 0.009). Of the patients involved in the study, 83.5% exhibited hypertensive phase (HP) of AGV vs 43.5% of DPM (P = 0.04). AGV had a tendency to fail earlier (5 months 7 following AGV vs 13 months 13 following DPM, P = 0.07, t-test). Patients with either a second valve insertion or valve removal were 7/30 of AGV vs 1/30 in DPM (P = 0.05). Stent removal was needed by 10/30 DPM and 8/30 AGV had needling/5-FU. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of patients free from failure was similar between the two groups at 36 months. DPM is associated with lower mean IOP in the long term compared to AGV.","Tulane Univ, Ctr Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Med Ctr Louisiana, Dept Ophthalmol, New Orleans, LA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Ophthalmol, Tampa, FL USA; Boston Univ, Med Ctr, Univ Eye Associates Inc, Boston, MA USA; Univ Tampa, Glaucoma Ctr, Tampa, FL 33606 USA; Ophthalm Consultants Boston Inc, Boston, MA USA","Ayyala, RS (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Ctr Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",,,,,,,12,68,70,0,1,SLACK INC,THOROFARE,"6900 GROVE RD, THOROFARE, NJ 08086 USA",0022-023X,,,OPHTHALMIC SURG LAS,Ophthalmic Surg.

Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) is an example of polymer hydrogels applied for the synthesis of hydrogel to be used in different biomedical applications. This paper describes a study on rheological properties of PVP hydrogels obtained by gamma radiation techniques. PVP hydrogels were obtained by gamma radiation of PVP water solutions with different radiation doses. It was studied the influence of additives such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and glycerol on the rheological behaviour of the gel. The rheological behaviour of hydrogel samples was characterized by measuring the shear storage modulus (G') under dynamic shear loading. Besides this, sterility and cytotoxicity tests were performed. The study on rheological behaviour of hydrogels showed that G' of PVP gels change according to the additive used. Glycerol increases the fluidity of the gel. The influence of PEG depends on the amount and on its molecular mass. The increase on PEG amount and molecular mass cause a decrease of G' and an increase in the crosslinking density of PVP hydrogel network. The use of high molecular weight PEO allows the increase of the elasticity of the PVP gels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The mechanical oscillation of gel was produced via oscillating chemical reaction, called the Belousov Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. We have prepared an ionic gel consisting of the cross-linked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chain to which ruthenium tris(2,2'-bipyridine), a catalyst for the BZ reaction, was covalently bonded. The BZ reaction occurring within the gel matrix generates periodic redox changes of the catalyst moiety. This chemical oscillation is converted into the mechanical oscillation of the polymer network. As a result, the gel exhibits a periodical swelling deswelling change. The self-oscillating behaviors of the gel were investigated in detail. When the gel size is smaller than the chemical wavelength, the redox change occurs homogeneously in the gel. In this case, the volume change is isotropic and the mechanical oscillation synchronizes with chemical oscillation without a phase difference. The period and amplitude can be controlled by changing the outer substrate concentrations. In the case of rectangular shape, chemical wave propagates along the length of the gel. The wavelength and velocity depend on the reaction rate of autocatalytic process as well as the diffusivity of the activator. The dynamic behavior that locally shrunken (or swollen) parts propagate was observed, similar to the peristaltic motion of worms. By using lithography technique, a ciliary motion actuator made of the gel has been demonstrated. These self-oscillating gels may be useful in a number of important applications to intelligent biomaterials such as pulse generator or chemical pacemaker, auto-mobile actuators or micropumps with peristaltic motion, device for signal transmission, etc. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Once laid down in tissues, polymeric elastin is not subject to turnover, but is able to sustain its mechanical resilience through thousands of millions of cycles of extension and recoil. Elastin consists of ca. 36 domains with alternating hydrophobic and cross-linking characteristics. It has been suggested that these hydrophobic domains, predominantly containing glycine, proline, leucine and valine, often occurring in tandemly repeated sequences, are responsible for the ability of elastin to align monomeric chains for covalent cross-linking. We have shown that small, recombinantly expressed polypeptides based on sequences of human elastin contain sufficient information to self-organize into fibrillar structures and promote the formation of lysine-derived cross-links. These cross-linked polypeptides can also be fabricated into membrane structures that have solubility and mechanical properties reminiscent of native insoluble elastin. Understanding the basis of the self-organizational ability of elastin-based polypeptides may provide important clues for the general design of self-assembling biomaterials.","Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Cardiovasc Res Program, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Keeley, FW (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Cardiovasc Res Program, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",fwk@sickkids.ca,,,,,,32,97,100,0,21,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

The lipid film displayed an advancing contact angle of similar to 60degrees, elemental composition, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, was in agreement with that anticipated for a lipid membrane. Data obtained from both high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and ellipsometry were consistent with the formation of a supported lipid monolayer. In addition, polarized external reflection infrared spectroscopy revealed significant acyl chain ordering induced on lipid fusion and polymerization. Doping the lipid assembly with a fluorescein terminated polymerizable lipid provided visible confirmation of film formation and its stability under a variety of conditions, including shear rates of 2000 sec(-1). Transport studies demonstrated that the addition of a lipid film significantly reduced barrier permeability for compounds in excess of 70 kD.

These values were calculated by using both direct and alternate current methods. The comparison with Ti-6Al-4V, widely used as biomaterial, shows slightly lower corrosion rates for the non V-containing alloys. To determine the pitting corrosion resistance, anodic polarisation curves were performed. Those alloys containing Zr, with very low passivation current densities, show the best behaviour. This indicates a low susceptibility to localised corrosion in these alloys.

In this way donor-side morbidity can be avoided. A type A lesion of the vertrebral body can be the reason of a neurological deficit, requiring a corpectomy by means of an anterior approach, tricortical bone grafting and internal stabilization to get a fusion over time. It is our aim to introduce in this study a newly designed vertrebral replacement device, tested in an animal model, using domestic pigs. Two biomaterials, Cementek(R) and Biobon(R) were primarily macroscopically and microscopically evaluated, using a critically sized bone defect of a vertebral body and compared with autologous bone grafts. The final tests consisted of two groups of four animals. A corpectomy at the level of L4 was created and stabilized by means of the newly designed vertebral replacement implant. Autologous bone grafts were applied in one group of animals and Cementek(R) in the other to fill the remaining space. Fusion was studied using anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, followed by a computer tomography. The biocompatibility of the biomaterials and autologous bone grafts were in order of : Cementek > autologous bone grafts > Biobon. In the final tests after a six months period, a fusion was diagnosed in four cases, two delayed unions, and two obvious non-unions. An anlysis of the failures in this animal study can possibly clarify the shortcomings of this concept. Perhaps, subtle changes of the design combined with other synthetic bone substitutes can possibly improve the fusion rate in the near future.","Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, Dept Traumatol & Reconstruct Surg, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Vanderschot, P (reprint author), Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, Dept Traumatol & Reconstruct Surg, Herestr 49, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",paul.vanderschot@uz.kuleuven.ac.be,,,,,,40,5,5,0,1,ACTA MEDICAL BELGICA,BRUSSELS,"AVENUE CIRCULAIRE 138 A, B-1180 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM",0001-5458,,,ACTA CHIR BELG,Acta Chir.

Therefore, we investigated whether the combination of MTS proliferation assay and live-dead viability assay is suitable for testing microencapsulated L929 fibroblasts in long-time culture. Proliferation of L929 cells was shown by a significant increase of formazan absorbance within the first 3 weeks (Day 0: 0.132 +/- 0.047; Day 7: 0.404 +/- 0.101; Day 14: 0.728 +/- 0.239; Day 21: 0.877 +/- 0.224) followed by stagnation and decrease thereafter. This was confirmed by an increasing proportion of dead cells measured by the live-dead assay. Thus, proliferation of encapsulated L929 can be reliably investigated by the MTS assay. In combination with life-dead assays, the proliferation can be correlated to the survival rate of the encapsulated cells.","Univ Rostock, Dept Surg, D-18055 Rostock, Germany; Univ Rostock, Dept Med, Rostock, Germany; Univ Groningen, Med Biol Sect, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Freiburg, Dept Surg, Freiburg, Germany","Bunger, CM (reprint author), Univ Rostock, Dept Surg, Schillingallee 35, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.",,"de Vos, Paul/A-3170-2013",,,,,24,16,17,2,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Accordingly, the respective membrane surfaces must have optimal properties in terms of biocompatibility for blood or tissue. Flat membranes prepared by a phase inversion process from polyetherimide were modified by binding of tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane to obtain a surface with hydroxyl groups by binding of polyethylene imine to attach a hydrophilic macromolecule with amine groups useful as a spacer for later bonding of further ligands and by attachment of heparin. The binding of the different ligands was successful as monitored by different physicochemical methods. The blood response of plain polyetherimide was comparable to that of polyacrylonitrile, and it could be further improved by the binding of heparin. The tissue compatibility of polyetherimide and its different modifications was compared with commercial cell culture substrate membranes (Millicell) and found to be comparable for polyetherimide and even better after the modification with tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane. In conclusion, polyetherimide seems to be an interesting material for the production of membranes for application in biohybrid organ systems.","GKSS Res Ctr Geesthacht GmbH, Dept Biomat, Inst Chem, D-14513 Teltow, Germany; Univ Patras, Dept Engn Mech, Biomed Engn Lab, Patras, Greece","Groth, T (reprint author), GKSS Res Ctr Geesthacht GmbH, Dept Biomat, Inst Chem, Kantstr 55, D-14513 Teltow, Germany.",,"Seifert, Barbara/K-7569-2012","Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,39,57,57,2,25,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Tools to study blood response towards a variation in materials wettability with minimal variation in chemistry are ""gradient surfaces"". However, most gradients have been prepared by diffusion or density immersion techniques, which results in a limited gradient range. Through glow discharge with partial shielding, gradients on polymers were prepared over a length of 5 cm, which facilitated Studies to platelet adhesion on separate gradient sections. On polyethylene, advancing water contact angles varied from 90 degrees to 40 degrees, with a hysteresis of 30 degrees. ESCA indicated an increasing incorporation of oxygen towards the hydrophilic end. To examine the role of materials wettability on the activation of adhering platelets, sections of shielded plasma gradients were incubated in anticoagulated whole human blood. Fewer platelets adhered to the hydrophobic end, but those platelets were more activated than those on the hydrophilic end, as judged from their morphology and exposure of GpIIb-IIIa complex. However, partly related to the increased binding of platelets, the clotting activation after platelet deposition was highest on the hydrophilic end. Concluding, this new technique results in a large gradient range, which facilitates studies of formed blood elements in relation to the wettability. Platelets are more activated on hydrophobic polyethylene. while on moderate hydrophilic polyethylene more platelet adhesion and activation of the clotting system occurs.

Cylindrical specimens of material A were implanted subcutaneously and intraperitoneally in Wistar rats. The implants were retrieved after 2 years. Histology showed that the material was well-tolerated. Detailed analysis of the surface of the implants by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) revealed that the material remained stable. No differences could be detected between the ESCA spectra of the explants, and those of the control specimens. which were from the same synthetic batch and which were stored in dry form during the entire experimental period. Material B was also stable upon irradiation with X-rays in vitro. even at high doses, compared to the clinical situation, Exposure of material B to gamma -radiation. however. was found to lead to structural degradation. This was evident from clear yellowing, and also from the ESCA spectra. The spectra revealed that material B deteriorates during gamma -irradiation through rupture of C-C and/or C-O chemical bonds, not via C-I bond disruption. It can be concluded that iodine is tightly bound to these radiopaque biomaterials. This is important with regard to potential applications of these materials as implant biomaterials.

The hypothesis that coating a pin with a silver-containing compound will decrease bacterial colonisation and/or pin tract infection has been confirmed in other studies in vitro and in vivo experiments. In this work, biocompatibility of silver-coated orthopaedic external fixation pins was compared with stainless steel controls in an in vitro study. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were used to assess the possible genotoxic effect of silver, studying the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges and micronuclei while fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) and osteoblast-like cells were used for cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility studies. These studies have shown that silver is neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic as compared to stainless steel. a material in wide use as a metal implant. At 4 days cells cultured on the silver-coated material evidenced good cell spreading and a higher cell count with respect to the uncoated material. It appears that the addition of silver onto implantable medical devices could be beneficial when specific biological properties, such as antibacterial behaviour, are required. Based on these and the previous bacterial studies it seems like the toxicity towards bacteria was quite a bit greater than that towards the human cells. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Human osteoblastic cells were derived from fresh trabecular bone explants removed during total knee arthroplasty. On reaching confluence, cells were subcultured in 6 well plates, the resulting Subcultures were incubated until confluence and polyethylene or alpha -alumina particles were added to some while the rest were left as controls. The IL-6 mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription (RT) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IL-6 secretion as measured in the conditioned medium. The IL-6 expression was higher in the presence of both biomaterials. Maximum expression occurred in response to a dose of 50 mg particles/well with both biomaterials and was greater after polyethylene particle addition than after alpha -alumina particle addition at this dose. The maximum IL-6 secretion elicited by alpha -alumina was produced at 10 mg particles/well while maximum response with polyethylene required 50 mg/well. At a dose of 10 mg/well, alpha -alumina particles induced more secretion than 10 mg of polyethylene particles. Nevertheless, at a dose of 50 mg/well maximum secretion was produced with polyethylene particles. In conclusion and in our experimental conditions. polyethylene as well as alpha -alumina increased both the expression and the secretion of IL-6 in human osteoblastic cells in primary culture and Stimulation from polyethylene appears stronger than that from alpha -alumina at the same dose.

We have examined the surface compatibility of uncoated and coated microfabricated glass and semiconductor surfaces under static Solution (cell culture) and flow experiments (microfluidic device) using glial (astrocyte and glioblastoma) cells. Bare semiconductor and glass Surfaces were most attractive to cell adhesion, promoting biofouling under both static and flow conditions. Passivation of the surfaces was performed with silane coupling agents octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS)or N-(triethoxysilylpropyl)-O-polyethylene oxide urethane (TESP) on SiO2 surfaces via self-assembled monolayer (SAM) deposition. The hydrophilic TESP coating was effective at inhibiting biofouling of the microfluidic structure, allowing greater than several minutes of fluid flow. The hydrophobic OTMS coating, on the other hand, promoted cell adhesion leading to restricted flow within a few minutes. Interestingly, under cell Culture conditions the TESP surface exhibited biocompatible properties for glial cell adhesion and proliferation. in contrast to the OTMS surface which resisted cell growth. These studies suggest that cell adhesion is dependent upon the time domain of the cell-surface interaction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Phosphorylation was therefore envisaged as the means to enhance cellulose bioactivity. In vitro studies showed that regenerated cellulose hydrogels promote bone cells attachment and proliferation but do not mineralize in acellular simulated physiological conditions. On the contrary, phosphorylated cellulose has shown an opposite behavior, by inducing the formation of a calcium phosphate layer in simulated physiological conditions, but behaving as a poor substrate for bone cells attachment and proliferation. In order to investigate the in vivo behavior of these materials, and assess the influence of mineralization induction ability vs. bone cells compatibility, unmodified and phosphorylated cellulose hydrogels were implanted in rabbits for a maximum period of 6 months and bone regeneration was investigated. Despite the difficulties arising from the retraction of cellulose hydrogels upon dehydration during the preparation of retrieved implants, histological observations showed no inflammatory response after implantation, with bone intra-spongious regeneration of cells and the integration of the unmodified as well as the phosphorylated cellulose implants. After a maximum implantation period of 6 months, histological observations, histomorphometry and the measurement of the amount of Ca-45 incorporated in the surrounding tissue indicated a slightly better osseointegration of phosphorylated cellulose, although no significant differences between the two materials were found.

New materials are still under development to minimise the wear of joints and to improve in this way the performance of total joint replacements. Testing the wear performance of very low wear materials is a rather sophisticated technique. Currently, the worn volume is calculated from the weight variations of the sample, observed from wear testing. This method may be limited especially when very low weight differences are to be evaluated on high hardness, high-density materials like CoCr alloys or ceramics like alumina or zirconia. In the present work, the tribological behaviour of ceramic biomaterials like alumina, Y-TZP and alumina-zirconia composites was evaluated by a pin-on-disc apparatus under different testing conditions. The worn volume was calculated by the use of 3-D (three-dimensional) optical profilometry data. Comparison between 3-D optical profilometry and gravimetric wear data shows the better accuracy of the profilometric method in the determination of wear rate in the range of 10(-7) mm(3) (mN(-1)) or lower.

The properties of the modified PDLLA surface and the control one were investigated by contact angle and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The former indicated the variation of hydrophilicity and the latter suggested that the modified PDLLA film using silk fibroin is enriched with nitrogen atoms. The biocompatibility of the PDLLA film may be altered and in turn affects the seeded cell functions Therefore, attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts seeded on the modified PDLLA films and the control one were examined. Cell morphologies on these films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. In addition. differentiated cell function was assessed by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity.

Such scaffolds should provide a preformed three-dimensional shape and prevent cells from escaping into the articular cavity. Furthermore, these constructs should have sufficient mechanical strength to facilitate handling in a clinical setting and stimulate the uniform spreading of cells and their phenotype redifferentiation. The aim of this study was to verify the ability of HYAFF (R) 11, a recently developed hyaluronic-acid-based biodegradable polymer, to support the growth of human chondrocytes and to maintain their original phenotype. This capability was assessed by the evaluation of collagen types I, II and aggrecan mRNA expression. Immunohistochemical analyses were also performed to evaluate collagen types I, II and proteoglycans synthesis. A field emission in lens scanning microscopy was utilized to verify the interactions between the cells and the biomaterial. Our data indicate that human chondrocytes seeded on HYAFF (R) 11 express and produce collagen type II and aggrecan and downregulate the production of collagen type I. These results provide an in vitro demonstration for the therapeutic potential of HYAFF (R) 11 as a delivery vehicle in a tissue-engineered approach towards the repair of articular cartilage defects.

L-cysteine was covalently immobilized onto two biomedical polymers: polyurethane (PU) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The L-cysteine content on the polymers was approximately 5-8 nmol/cm(2) as quantified via a chemiluminescence-based assay. The haemocompatibility of the modified polymers was evaluated in terms of the number of adhered platelets when exposed to a platelet suspension labeled with Cr-51. Platelet adherence on the L-cysteine-modified polymers was reduced more than 50% as compared to the control (glycine-modified polymers) when the platelet suspension contained plasma constituents. No difference in platelet adhesion was observed in the absence of plasma constituents. Further experiments demonstrated that NO was easily transferred to the L-cysteine-modified polymers from S-nitroso-albumin in PBS buffer. The NO was then released from the polymer. NO transfer or release was not observed for the control. The results suggest that L-cysteine-modified polymers are effective in reducing platelet adhesion via the transfer of NO from endogenous S-nitroso proteins in plasma to the polymer followed by the subsequent release of NO. Thus, exploiting endogenous NO is a viable option for improving the haemocompatibility of biomaterials. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Down-regulation of their immune system, by means of drugs, is necessary in order to perform an allograft implantation afterwards. The patient may need a temporary prosthetic cornea while the immune system is inactivated. Recently, NeuroPatch (R), a mesh-type polyurethane, was used for this purpose. The material exhibits excellent biocompatibility and allows ingrowth of stromal fibroblasts which deposit matrix material into the pores. A serious drawback of NeuroPatch (R) is its non-transparency, which impairs vision. In this work we attempted to develop an improved biomaterial that combines the advantages of NeuroPatch (R) with optical transparency. Based on previous findings that copolymers of hexaethyleneglycolmethacrylate (HEGMA) and butylmethacrylate (BMA), are transparent and well accepted by human corneal epithelial cells, we studied these materials further in detail. (Bruining et al., Bio-Macromolecules 1 (2000) 418) Copolymerizations were studied by means of H-1 NMR. The influence of the HEGMA content on hydrophilicity, flexibility and resistance to protein adsorption was studied. The results indicate that materials with a HEGMA content of approximately 20 mol% are potentially useful in corneal repair surgery. These biomaterials meet most of the stringent physical and biological requirements. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A dynamic flow system and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) were used to investigate the adsorption of proteins from diluted human plasma on hydroxyapatite, alumina and zirconia, with regard to total protein binding capacity, relative binding capacity for specific proteins and flow-through and desorption patterns. The ceramics were characterized regarding physicochemical properties, namely, chemical composition by elementary analyses and specific surface, pore volume and pore size distribution using the BET-method and Hg-porosimetry. The materials were found to adsorb a surprisingly low amount of plasma proteins, leaving more than 70% of the surface free. The cellular response will therefore be highly affected by the physico-chemical properties of the material, in contrast to a surface fully covered with proteins. Regarding the adsorption of proteins, most proteins exhibited similar flow-through patterns on the three adsorbents. The exceptions with different flow-through patterns were apolipoprotein D (Apo D), apolipoprotein J (Apo J), complement factor C1s (C1s). complement factor C3 (C3), ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, alpha (1) B glycoprotein and alpha (2) HS glycoprotein a nd serum retinal-binding protein (SRBP).

It could be shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy that DLC coating prepared by 800 eV CHn+ beam bombardment possessed a higher fraction of sp(3) bonds in the structure of mixed sp(3) + sp(2) bonding, resulting in a higher hydrophobicity. The results of the cell attachment tests indicated that DLC coatings exhibited low macrophage attachment and provided desirable surface for the normal cellular growth and morphology of the fibroblasts. At the same time, the number of both neutral granulocytes and platelets adhering to DLC coatings decreased significantly.

We demonstrated that the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) or protein serine/threonine kinase (PSK) dependency and the PTK PSK cross-talk compensation For macrophage adhesion varied dynamically with the substratum modification and the culture time. The inhibition of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) decreased macrophage adhesion oil TCPS, whereas the inhibition of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3 kinase) decreased macrophage adhesion oil networks at 24 h, The PI3 kinase-protein kinase C (PKC)-MAPK cascade was involved in macrophage adhesion on fibronectin-preadsorbed TCPS or networks but not oil fibronectin-grafted networks, This fibronectin-mediated adhesion signalling involved both RGD and PHSRN sequences in a form of G(3)RGDG(6)PHSRNG on TCPS but not oil networks. Furthermore, G(3)RGDG(6)PHSRNG grafted onto networks evoked unique signalling in macrophage adhesion From that preadsorbed onto networks. Thus, macrophage adhesion and the role of selected signalling kinases were modulated by the substratum and the ligand conjugation method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Bone, similar to other calcified tissues, is an intimate composite of the organic (collagen and non-collagenous proteins) and inorganic or mineral phases. The bone mineral idealized as calcium hydroxyapatite, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2), is a carbonate-hydroxyapatite, approximated by the formula: (Ca,X)(10)(PO4,HPO4,CO3)(6)(OH,Y)(2), where X are cations (magnesium, sodium, strontium ions) that can substitute for the calcium ions, and Y are anions (chloride or fluoride ions) that can substitute for the hydroxyl group. The current author presents a brief review of CaP biomaterials that now are used as grafts for bone repair, augmentation, or substitution. Commercially-available CaP biomaterials differ in origin (natural or synthetic), composition (hydroxyapatite, beta-tricalcium phosphate, and biphasic CaP), or physical forms (particulates, blocks, cements, coatings on metal implants, composites with polymers), and in physicochemical properties. CaP biomaterials have outstanding properties: similarity in composition to bone mineral; bioactivity (ability to form bone apatitelike material or carbonate hydroxyapatite on their surfaces), ability to promote cellular function and expression leading to formation of a uniquely strong bone-CaP biomaterial interface; and osteoconductivity (ability to provide the appropriate scaffold or template for bone formation). In addition, CaP biomaterials with appropriate three-dimensional geometry are able to bind and concentrate endogenous bone morphogenetic proteins in circulation, and may become osteoinductive (capable of osteogenesis), and can be effective carriers of bone cell seeds. Therefore, CaP biomaterials potentially are useful in tissue engineering for regeneration of hard tissues.","NYU, Coll Dent, Dept Biomat & Biomimet, New York, NY 10010 USA","LeGeros, RZ (reprint author), NYU, Coll Dent, Dept Biomat, 345 E 24th St, New York, NY 10010 USA.",,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771","NIDCR NIH HHS [DE 12388, DE07223, DE 04123]; NCRR NIH HHS [S07RR076226]",,,139,956,985,27,438,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-921X,1528-1132,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

The most ideal support is a biodegradable, porous, elastic graft (Biomaterials, 15 (1994) 83). However, a specific graft meeting these criteria is not available yet. Fibrin glue on the other hand, although used for other purposes in cardiac surgery, theoretically meets the criteria for ideal extravascular support. In this ex vivo study, we evaluated the possible beneficial effect of perivenous application of fibrin glue. Methods: Segments of human vein graft obtained during CABG procedures in 14 consecutive patients were placed in a side loop of the extracorporeal perfusion circuit. In this way the study vein crafts did meet identical circumstances as the vein grafts implanted. Perfusion in the loop was started with a flow just enough to counteract the collapse of the vein, usually about 8 mmHg, and alternately around the segments fibrin glue was applied or no perivenous support was administered as control. After 1 min of soldification, perfusion was started with a pressure of about 60 min Hg (non-pulsatile flow). Perfusion was maintained for 60 min, after which the grafts were collected for light microscopic and electron microscopic assessment. Results: Light microscopy and electron microscopy showed remarkable attenuation of endothelial cell loss and less injury of smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer of the media in the fibrin glue supported vein g-rafts compared to the non-supported group. Conclusion: Fibrin glue is able to accomplish adequate external vein graft support, preventing overdistention, in an ex vivo model. This provides a basis for clinical application. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate long-term effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This second messenger is known to modulate cell morphology in static conditions. In classical flow devices, cells are submitted to only tangential stresses. We designed a new flow system, a Hele-Shaw cell with a porous bottom wall, in order to take into account the influence of a transmural pressure. This flow chamber allows to follow up continuously the shape changes of cells that are adherent to a porous biomaterial (polyacrylonitrile) and are exposed to controlled levels of shear stress or transmural pressure. Mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to a 1.1-Pa shear stress, as well as those exposed to a 84-mm Hg transmural pressure, round up (up to 50%) in a few minutes. If the cAMP pathway is inhibited when a mechanical stress is applied, cell rounding is significantly prevented. These observations suggest that flow-induced cell shape changes are cAMP-dependent. This conclusion is supported by an increased cAMP accumulation measured in cells under mechanical stress when compared to static experiments. Our in vitro flow system is thus useful to study the influence of transmural pressure or shear stress on the early morphological and biochemical responses of cells in contact with a biomaterial.","Univ Technol Compiegne, CNRS, UMR 6600, F-60205 Compiegne, France","Chotard-Ghodsnia, R (reprint author), Univ Technol Compiegne, CNRS, UMR 6600, BP 20529, F-60205 Compiegne, France.",,,,,,,47,2,2,0,2,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-0042,,,EUR PHYS J-APPL PHYS,Eur.

Along with fibroblasts, they comprise the synovial tissue that forms the lining of musculoskeletal joint capsules and bursae, and they often envelop implants. During the process of phagocytosing prosthesis-related particles, macrophages in peri-implant tissue release inflammatory mediators. Little is known, however, about the response of these cells to mechanical perturbation, which often is a component of the physical environment of the cell. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were grown on a flexible membrane bi vitro and a dynamic 1-Hz spatially uniform sinusoidal strain pattern imparted to the elastomeric substrate. The effect of mechanical strain on prostaglandin (PG) E-2 release was evaluated using cells that were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as by those that were not. The results are compared with the levels of PGE(2) stimulated by metallic particles. Strain magnitudes of 4 and 8% applied for 1 h resulted in almost a twofold increase in the release of PGE(2) from LPS-stimulated cells (p < 0.05) and nonstimulated macrophages (p < 0.07), compared with nonperturbated controls. No release was elicited by a challenge of metal particles. These findings demonstrate for the first time an effect of mechanical force on the release of an inflammatory mediator by macrophages. This response may help to explain the macrophage-mediated processes underlying the osteolysis associated with loose prostheses in bone and suggests a mechanism for the inflammation of CIO synovial tissues by excessive mechanical strain.

Two successful approaches have been to incorporate minimal cell adhesion recognition sequences at the biomaterial surface and to integrate the entire adhesion molecule into a compatible synthetic matrix. While adhesion assays using immortalized cell lines are important in evaluating synthetic materials, cell type and source play a significant role in the ability of such models to mimic real tissues. Models that utilize multiple cell types or primary cells are more representative of native tissues than models that use single cell types or primary cells. In this study we investigated primary respiratory epithelial cell (REC) adhesion to modified fluoropolymers incorporating simple functional groups and minimal peptide recognition sequences, and we evaluated the potential of hybrid biopolymer materials to support adhesion and proliferation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to verify substrate surface composition. Significant differences were found in the adhesion characteristics of primary REC and in the A549 lung carcinoma cell line. Model Systems composed of multiple cell types and/or primary cells necessarily represent increased levels of complexity for an investigation of cellular responses to synthetic surfaces. When evaluating biomaterials, adhesion studies using immortalized cell lines cannot necessarily be extrapolated to normal cell behavior.

However, the effects of low-level, extended exposures of monocytes to metal ions which are known to be released from dental alloys is not known. Thus, in the current study we characterized the metabolic activity of monocytes in the presence of low doses of Ag, Cu, Hg and Ni ions for up to 4 weeks. THP-1 human monocytes were exposed in vitro to concentrations of metal ions at 1-10% of those known to be lethal during 24 h exposures. Mitochondrial function [succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity] and total cellular protein [bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay] were assessed at weekly intervals during metal exposure. Each metal ion caused a unique pattern of effects from the monocytes. These effects were sometimes delayed until several weeks into the exposure (Cu, Ni). Large increases in total protein or SDH activity per cell were observed (Cu 150%, Hg 40-60%, Ni 50%), but these increases were always transient. The differences between concentrations with minimal effects and those which were lethal (8 versus 12 mumol L-1 for Ag, 1.0 versus 1.5 mumol L-1 for Hg) were small. Finally, concentrations which caused total suppression of cellular activity were sometimes preceded by an increased activity (Hg, Ni). We concluded that metal ions alter monocyte metabolic activity during extended exposures in vitro, but that the concentrations required are often near long-term lethal levels. Clinically, these results imply that the levels of metals released from dental alloys may be significant to monocytic function.","Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; Univ Vienna, Sch Dent, Vienna, Austria; Hokkaido Univ, Sch Dent, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan; Univ Geneva, Sch Dent Med, Geneva, Switzerland","Wataha, JC (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,28,42,49,2,5,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-182X,,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

Several studies have attempted to determine the ideal combination of dental materials and laboratory techniques to produce the most accurate dental cast, Most have made use of 2-dimensional manual Measuring devices, which neglect to account for the dimensional changes that exist along a 3-dimensional surface. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of impression tray selection and cast formation techniques on the dimensional change of a dental cast with the use of new, 3-dimensioinal optical digitizing technology. Material and methods. Multiple impressions of a machined steel die that resembled a dental arch were made with custom and stock impression trays and vinyl polysiloxane impression material. The impressions were poured in type V artificial dental stone and allowed to set with the tray inverted or non-inverted. The steel master die and stone casts were digitized with the Steinbichler Cornet. 100 Optical Digitizer, which was developed at the Minnesota Dental Research Center for Biomaterials and Biomechanics. Three-dimensional images of the stone casts were aligned to the 3-dimensional image of the master die and analyzed with AnSur-NT software. Multiple measurements of the master die and stone casts were analyzed to determine the accuracy of the 3-dimensional technology and of the impression and cast fabrication techniques. Planar distances between the center of each crown preparation were measured, as were crown heights. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance (P<.05), and rout mean square error values were determined. Results. Casts were compared with a total of 45 significance tests, of which only 4 yielded P<.05. There was no pattern to these results, which suggests that they were false-positive findings. Conclusion.

Temporal and spatial control, along with the diversity in material properties found with photopolymerizable materials, are advantageous in the biomaterials industry. For instance, multifunctional anhydride monomers form highly cross-linked-surface-eroding networks directly in bone defects. These networks have good-mechanical properties that are maintained with degradation and have the potential to restore tissue-like properties to bone during the healing process. Additionally, cartilage-forming cells photoencapsulated in hydrogel networks secrete an extracellular matrix as the hydrogel is resorbed and may provide a treatment alternative for cartilage defects that do not heal spontaneously. Finally, transdermal polymerization (photopolymerization through the skin) of multifunctional monomers is a noninvasive technique that Is being developed for tissue regeneration and wound-healing applications.","Univ Colorado, Dept Chem Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Anseth, KS (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Chem Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,27,52,52,0,18,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DR, WARRENDALE, PA 15086 USA",0883-7694,,,MRS BULL,MRS Bull.,FEB,2002.0,27,2,,,,,130,136,,10.1557/mrs2002.49,,,,7,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Materials Science; Physics,522TE,WOS:000173912400022,,,,,2019-02-25

For the study, 16.8-mm x 5-mm discs were prepared from mixtures of hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate. Five mixtures of hydroxyapatite-ceramic and hydroxyapatite-cement paste forms were studied: 100 percent hydroxyapatite-ceramic (Interpore), 60 percent hydroxyapatite-ceramic, 100 percent hydroxyapatite-cement paste, 60 percent hydroxyapatite-cement paste, and 20 percent hydroxyapatite-cement paste. Biomaterials were implanted in subcutaneous and intramuscular soft-tissue pockets in 10 adult sheep. Cranial bone grafts of equal dimension were implanted as controls. One year after implantation, the volume of all biomaterials and bone grafts was determined from a computed tomographic scan, and porosity and bone formation were determined using backscatter electron microscopy. Cranial bone and the 20 percent hydroxyapatite-cement paste implants demonstrated significant volume reduction in all sites after 1 year (p<0.001). No significant difference in volume of the remaining four biomaterials was found. There was no significant change in pore size in the ceramic implants (range, 200 to 300 &mu;) and in the cement-paste implants containing 60 percent hydroxyapatite or more (range, 3 to 5 nm). Pore size in the cement-paste implants containing 20 percent hydroxyapatite increased significantly with resorption of the tricalcium-phosphate component. reaching a maximum of 200 to 300 &mu; in the periphery,, where the greatest tricalcium-phosphate resorption had occurred. Both ceramic biomaterials demonstrated lamellar bone deposition within well-formed haversian systems through the entire depth of the iniplants, ranging from a mean of 6.6 percent to 11.7 percent. There was minimal bone formation in the cement-paste implants containing 60 percent hydroxyapatite or more. In contrast, cement-paste implants containing 20 percent hydroxyapatite demonstrated up to 10 percent bone replacement, which was greatest in the periphery of the implants where the greatest tricalcium-phosphate resorption had occurred. This study confirms the occurrence of true osteoinduction within hydroxyapatite-derived biomaterials, when examined using backscatter techniques.

A. minutum cells exhibited higher adhesion for the random copolymer made up of polystyrene (29%), polystyrene aspartic acid dimethyl ester sulfamide (47%) and polystyrene sodium sulfonate (24%), than for samples of this series with different compositions. In contrast to this, A. minutum adhesion remained very low throughout the phenylalanine and leucine copolymer series. These results indicate that the cell-substrate adhesion phenomenon is dependent upon the final composition of the copolymer, i.e. that it is composition-specific. Taxonomic specificity was then demonstrated by presenting the PSAspOMe copolymer series with cells of the non toxic species H. triquetra (Peridinialia) related to A. minutum (Gonyaulacacea), and by observing no specific association, i.e. no signal above background levels at any composition. Specific ligand-cell adhesion is evidenced for the first time between biospecific RACS and phytoplankton, which may inspire a new generation of structures to be used in aquaculture as protective nets over shellfish clusters, or as selective filtering devices to assist in shellfish depuration from toxic microalgae.

The cholesteryl-(L-lactic acid)((n) over bar) (CLA((n) over bar)) oligomers form thermotropic liquid crystals and self-assemble into lamellar structures consisting of interdigitated bilayers.

Using MAPLE, thin films of N-(4-nitrophenyl)-(L)-prolinol or NPR an NLO material; polypyrrole, a conductive polymer; and tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum or Alq3, a luminescent organic compound, have been separately deposited with minor ( in the case of Alq3) or no degradation (for the NPP and polypyrrole) to their optical and electrical properties. The MAPLE process has also been used to deposit discrete thin film micro-arrays of biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA). The deposited BSA films, after washing with a blocking protein and fluorescently tagged streptavidin, fluoresce when exposed to UV. This fluorescence indicates that the biochemical specificity of the transferred biotinylated protein is unaffected by the MAPLE process. These results demonstrate that the MAPLE technique can be used for growing thin films of functional polymer and active biomaterials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Porous chitosan matrices, chitosan-poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) composite matrices and chitosan coated on PLLA matrices were dealt with in this research. Porous chitosan matrix was fabricated by freeze-drying and cross-linking aqueous chitosan solution. Porous chitosan matrix combined with ceramics and constituents of extracellular matrices were prepared and examined for their bone regenerative potential. Composite porous matrix of chitosan-PLLA was prepared by mixing polylactide with chitosan and freeze-drying. All chitosan based devices demonstrated improved bone forming capacity by increasing mechanical stability and biocompatibility. Release of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) from these matrices exerted significant osteoinductive effect in addition to the high osteoconducting capacity of the porous chitosan matrices. The hydrophobic surface of PLLA matrices was modified by chitosan to enhance cell affinity and wettability, The chitosan coated PLLA matrix induced increased osteoblast attachment as compared with intact PLLA surface. overall results in this study demonstrated the usefulness of chitosan as drug releasing scaffolds and as modification tools for currently used biomaterials to enhance tissue regeneration efficacy.

Although several leukocyte-derived molecules are used clinically, the long-term efficacy of treatments involving the systemic administration of these bioactive agents has yet to be demonstrated. Hence, the localized delivery of selected cytokines and growth factors produced by endogenous leukocytes is desirable and may have potential therapeutic values in the fundamental processes of tissue healing, growth regulation, and biocompatibility. The specificity and diversity of ligand-receptor interactions offer an attractive method in manipulating cellular behavior. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the interplay between ligands and cell membrane receptors must be obtained. We designed interleukin-1-derived biomimetic agonists and antagonists to study and modulate leukocyte function in vitro. Selected agonists increased GM-CSF release by adherent human blood-derived macrophages in the presence of the natural IL1beta antagonist, namely IL1ra. Furthermore, IL1-derived biomimetic antagonists neutralized the ability of IL1beta in increasing the release of GM-CSF by adherent macrophages. We employed similar methodologies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of integrin and extracellular matrix interaction in regulating leukocyte function. Oligopeptides were designed based on the functional structure of fibronectin and grafted on to a polymer network containing polyethyleneglycols. Macrophage adhesion was independent of the peptide identity that contained sequence RGD, PHSRN, PRRARV, or combinations thereof in an integrin-dependent fashion in vitro. However, integrin-dependent FBGC formation in vitro was highly dependent on both RGD and PHSRN in a single peptide formulation and with a specific orientation. From our intracellular signaling studies in vitro, protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases were found important in integrin signaling leading to macrophage adhesion mediated by fibronectin-integrin association. Furthermore, RGD and PHSRN appear to be significant in mediating this receptor-ligand association resulting in the necessary signaling characteristic for macrophage adhesion and the subsequent development. Our in vivo results showed that peptide identity played a minimal role in modulating the host inflammatory response and adherent macrophage density. RGD-containing peptides mediated rapid FBGC formation by 4 days of implantation by significantly increasing both the number of macrophages that participate in the cell fusion process and the rate of cell fusion. Both RGD and PHSRN domains were important in mediating FBGC formation at later implantation periods. These findings represent a mechanistic correlation between the role of protein functional architectures in ligand-receptor recognition and the post-ligation signaling events that control cellular behavior in vitro and in vivo.

The principal difference between the ADS matrix and similar structures developed previously results from presence of two active functional groups in the matrix. namely, aldehyde and sulfonate. These groups perform two different functions in the matrix. The aldehyde group is responsible for covalent bonding in the biomaterials, and the negatively charged sulfonate group provides electrostatic attraction of the positively charged biomolecules. By varying the ratio between the aldehyde and sulfonate groups in the matrix, one can control contributions from the two binding modes (covalent and electrostatic). A number of oligosaccharides, such as simple dextran. aldehyde dextran (AD), aldehyde dextran sulfonate (ADS) and aldehyde ethylcellulose (AEC). were used for preparation of matrix structures.

After grafting, it is desirable for bone ingrowth to proceed as quickly as possible because the strength of the implanted region depends on a good mechanical bond forming between the implant and surrounding regions in the body. Ingrowth can take place as a result of growth of tissue and cells into the implanted porous material. or it may be promoted by transplanting cells seeded onto such a material. The rate at which ingrowth occurs is dependent on many factors, including pore size and the interconnectivity of the implanted structure. In vivo graftings into osteochondral defects demonstrated that our biofabricated porous material is highly biocompatible with cartilage and bone tissue. The biofabricated matrix was well incorporated into the biphasic osteochondral area. Resorption was followed by bone and cartilage formation, and after 4 months, the biomaterial had been replaced by new tissue. Ossification was induced and enhanced without introduction of additional factors. We believe that this is the first time that such biofabricated materials have been used for biomedical purposes. In face of the obvious environmental disadvantages of harvesting from limited natural resources, we propose the use of bioengineered coralline and other materials such as those cultured by our group under field and laboratory conditions as a possible biomatrix for hard tissue remodeling.

In this respect, animal studies and cell cultures using non-specific cells are of limited value. Material and methods-The morphology and growth pattern of cells cultured from human stapes were studied. Cultured cells were examined for the presence of alkaline phosphatase and were processed for immunocytochemistry in order to detect the presence of osteocalcine. Fibroblast cultures served as controls. Results-Cultured stapes cells proliferated in a polygonal-cubic shape and without any regular pattern in the culture. These cells were shown to contain alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcine. Cultured fascia fibroblasts proliferated in a spindle-shaped form and in a pattern resembling a shoal of fish. Cultured fibroblasts did not contain alkaline phosphatase or osteocalcine. Conclusions-It is possible to culture osteoblasts from human stapes. These cells can be characterized as osteoblast-like cells by means of their external shape and the presence of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcine. Using these cultures, specific in vitro investigations concerning the interaction of biomaterials and middle ear ossicles could be performed.","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Essen, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol, Essen, Germany","Dost, P (reprint author), Univ HNO Klin, DE-45122 Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,23,3,8,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"CORT ADELERSGT 17, PO BOX 2562, SOLLI, 0202 OSLO, NORWAY",0001-6489,,,ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL,Acta Oto-Laryngol.,,2002.0,122,8,,,,,836,840,,10.1080/000164802321040964,,,,5,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,635GG,WOS:000180390400007,12542202.0,,,,2019-02-25

In a novel manner, poly-lactic acid/polyglycolic acid (PLGA) (50/50 wt.% mix) and polyurethane were separately synthesized to possess a range of fiber dimensions in the micron and nanometer regime. Preliminary results indicated that decreasing fiber diameter on both PLGA and PU enhanced arterial smooth muscle cell adhesion; specifically, arterial smooth muscle cell adhesion increased 23% when PLGA fiber dimensions decreased from 500 to 50 nm and increased 76% on nano-structured, compared to conventional structured, polyurethane. However, nano-structured PLGA decreased endothelial cell adhesion by 52%, whereas adhesion of these same cells was increased by 50% on polyurethane. For these reasons, the present in vitro study provides the first evidence that polymer fiber dimensions can be used to selectively control cell functions for vascular prosthesis.","Purdue Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Miller, DC (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,3,1,1,0,2,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-647-8,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,2002.0,711,,,,,,201,204,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,BU92B,WOS:000177402200028,,,,,2019-02-25

In the past, the degradation behaviour of the metal/ceramic interface (altogether, the metallic and the ceramic component plus the metal/ceramic interface), was investigated by means of standard electrochemical techniques [1-3]. In this work, standard samples, which are representative, in terms of chemical composition, of the most important layers present at the metal/ceramic interface, were prepared in an arc-melting furnace, which allows melting to be performed under a protective atmosphere (Ar). Electrochemical techniques and standard immersion tests were used to investigate the degradation behaviour of each individual layer. existing at the metal/ceramic interface. The self-passivating behaviour of the interface, which was observed both in vitro and in vivo in previous works, can be better understood on the basis of the present results. The degradation behaviour of the individual layers is correlated with the overall corrosion behaviour of the metal/ceramic interface. Results suggest that Ag and Cu have an important role regarding corrosion behaviour: while Ag contributes to the passivation of the interface, the Cu-rich layer of the metal/ceramic interface seems to be responsible for the major part of the Cu ions released to the physiological solution.","Univ Minho, Dept Mech Engn, PT-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; Univ Minho, Dept Phys, PT-4710057 Braga, Portugal","Rocha, LA (reprint author), Univ Minho, Dept Mech Engn, PT-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",,"Rocha, Luis/A-8592-2008","Rocha, Luis/0000-0002-7219-1518",,,,9,2,2,0,3,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",1013-9826,,0-87849-905-9,KEY ENG MAT,,,2002.0,230-2,,,,,,479,482,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.230-232.479,,,,4,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science,BV62B,WOS:000179553200110,,,,,2019-02-25

Greater knowledge of cultures of pathologic bone tissue-derived osteoblasts may be helpful in performing in vitro experiments that test biomaterials and therapies to be used in the orthopedic field, since this kind of approach better reflects the conditions of clinical relevance to many patients. In the present study primary cultures of human osteoblastic cells were isolated from donors with osteoporosis (HOB, Human Osteopenic Bone) and their respective controls (HNB, Human Normal Bone). They were then characterized in baseline conditions and after stimulation with 10(-9) M 1,25(OH2)D-3. Specific biochemical markers of bone cells and cytokines involved in bone turnover were evaluated to assess cell metabolism and any possible differences between osteoblasts derived from healthy and osteopenic bone tissue. Under baseline conditions, HNB and HOB in vitro cultures showed some differences in proliferation (MTT test), PICP, OC and IL-6. The HNB response to 1,25(OH,)D3 stimulation differed significantly from that of the HOB cultures but only with regard to the MTT test, and ALP and PICP levels; the other selected parameters showed a similar behavior for both cultures. The current findings should be taken into account when cultures derived from human bone arc used for in vitro experiments.","Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Res Inst Codivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Torricelli, P (reprint author), Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Res Inst Codivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy.",paola.torricelli@ior.it,"TORRICELLI, PAOLA/J-5298-2016; Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","TORRICELLI, PAOLA/0000-0001-7494-9970; Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,19,23,23,0,1,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1073-1199,1532-4184,,ARTIF CELL BLOOD SUB,Artif.

In that study, the laminin coating was applied before a dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment designed to extend preservation of laminin in situ. To address concerns that the biological activity of laminin might consequently be reduced, the present investigation examined the influences of DHT crosslinking on the activity of laminin in terms of neural cell growth in vitro. DHT crosslinking was performed on collagen (type I or IV) spread on glass in three groups: (1) before coating, (2) after coating, and (3) both before and after coating. PC-12 cells were disseminated in each of the three groups. All three groups were cultured, and the number of cells were compared statistically. Cell growth achieved through application of laminin coating after DHT crosslinking was statistically greater than that achieved when laminin coating was performed before crosslinking. A reduction in laminin activity induced by DHT crosslinking was demonstrated. The optimal timing for the crosslinking of biomaterials treated with trophic factors such as laminin should be examined in terms of the effects of crosslinking on the activity of the trophic factors.","Kyoto Univ, Dept Bioartificial Organs, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Toba, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Bioartificial Organs, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Sakyo Ku, 53 Kawahara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",,,,,,,27,6,6,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1058-2916,1538-943X,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JAN-FEB,2002.0,48,1,,,,,17,20,,10.1097/00002480-200201000-00005,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,510MH,WOS:000173211500005,11814092.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Their porosity properties might confer them the capacity to trigger fluid capillarity, tissue ingrowth, as well as good tissue-implant apposition and fixation. Before PTN materials are used as long-term implants, their biocompatibility level must be assessed. In this study, porous titanium-nickel was therefore extracted in a saline semi-physiological solution and materials were evaluated for potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reactions. The cytocompatibility elution test was performed in order to determine PTN toxic potential at the in vitro cellular level: no reactivity was detected in cell layers exposed to PTN extracts or the negative controls. In parallel, the genocompatibility of porous titanium-nickel was evaluated using three different assays in order to assess potential damage at the DNA level: the test for chemical induction of chromosome aberrations, the Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli reverse mutation assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. No significant increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations, bacterian revertant colonies, or micronuclei was observed in presence of PTN extracts when compared to negative control exposition. Based on the above results, porous titanium-nickel can be considered completely cytocompatible and genocompatible, and therefore represents a good candidate for long-term implantation.","Biorthex Inc, R&D Biomat Dept, Montreal, PQ H4N 3H5, Canada; Natl Res Council Canada, IMI, Boucherville, PQ J4B 6Y4, Canada; Hop St Justine, Ctr Rech Pediat, Montreal, PQ H3T 1C5, Canada","Assad, M (reprint author), Biorthex Inc, R&D Biomat Dept, 9001 Boul Acadie,Suite 802, Montreal, PQ H4N 3H5, Canada.",,,"Assad, Michel/0000-0001-8734-0267",,,,40,47,47,1,8,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The surface roughness of the composite started to increase after the initial 8 hours because of both the degradation of the polymer matrix and the nucleation of calcium phosphate. After 24 hours of immersion the surface of the composite was fully covered with calcium phosphate nuclei with diameters around 126 nm. As the immersion time increased, the nuclei increased both in number and size, and coalesced leading to the formation of a dense and uniform calcium phosphate layer on the surface of the composite only after 126 hours of SBF immersion. The results of in-situ AFM observation agreed with those of standard in-vitro bioactivity tests in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Thin-film X-ray diffraction demonstrated that the ratio of apatite to the polymer matrix was higher within the surface layer (40 mum deep from the surface) than that in the bulk after the immersion for 7 days. The water-uptake capability of the polymer contributes to the nucleation and growth of the calcium phosphate layer. These results suggest the great potential of the composite for a range of temporary applications on which bone-bonding ability is a desired property.","Univ Minho, Dept Polymer Eng, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Tech, Tissue Engn Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","Ito, A (reprint author), Univ Minho, Dept Polymer Eng, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",,"Leonor, Isabel/B-5260-2011; Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012; Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008","Leonor, Isabel/0000-0002-4319-4883; Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456; Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129",,,,13,2,2,0,4,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",1013-9826,,0-87849-889-3,KEY ENG MAT,,,2002.0,218-2,,,,,,55,59,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.218-220.55,,,,5,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science,BU17P,WOS:000175229300012,,,,,2019-02-25

Magnetic bacteria synthesize intracellular magnets which are encapsulated by lipid bilayer membranes. Sizes of BMPs vary from 50 - 100 nm in diameter, and number over 10 per cell. BMPs are composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) with a single magnetic domain. Easy aqueous dispersion of BMPs enable development of highly sensitive chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays by the chemical coupling of antibodies on BMP surfaces. BMPs can likewise be used as drug delivery systems employing magnetoliposomes with high capture volumes. We previously reported a technique for preparing recombinant BMPs on which proteins were displayed by gene-fusion. We furthermore applied such recombinant BMPs to biotechnologically-important issues, including novel bioassay platforms for medicine and environmental management.

At the ultra-structure level, the bone matrix is a composite material consisting of bone mineral particles, which are mainly substituted, calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite, and collagen, which is a natural polymer. Bone serves as the template for developing bone replacement materials. Research on biomaterials analogous to bone was started in the early 1980s by incorporating bioactive particles into biocompatible polymers so as to produce bone substitutes. Over the last two decades, a variety of bioactive polymer matrix. composites have been developed for tissue substitution and tissue regeneration. The bioactive phases in these composites are normally one of the calcium phosphates, especially synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) which closely resembles bone apatite and exhibits osteoconductivity. If enhanced bioactivity is required, bioceramics having higher bioactivity such as Bioglass(R) and A-W glass-ceramic can be used as the bioactive phase in the composites. For tissue replacement, bio-stable polymers such as polyethylene (PE) and polysulfone (PSU) are used as the matrix polymer. For tissue regeneration, natural, biodegradable polymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chitin are used as matrices. Furthermore, mechanical as well as biological performance of a particular composite can be controlled by varying the amount of the bioactive phase in the composite, thus meeting specific clinical requirements. For bioactive ceramic-polymer composites, major influencing factors such as shape, size and size distribution of bioactive particles, mechanical properties and volume percentage of the bioactive phase, propeties of the matrix polymer, distribution of bioactive particles in the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial state should be controlled in order to obtain materials of desirable properties. Various techniques are used to evaluate the composites.","Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Rehabil Engn Ctr, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Min, W (reprint author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Rehabil Engn Ctr, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,33,0,0,0,3,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-660-5,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,2002.0,724,,,,,,83,93,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Biomaterials; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Composites; Polymer Science",Materials Science; Polymer Science,BV76S,WOS:000179970700011,,,,,2019-02-25

One protein-based polymer, based on a sequence of native elastin, that has been utilized in the synthesis of biomaterials is poly (Valine-Proline-Glycine-Valine-Glycine) or poly(VPGVG) [1]. This polypeptide has been shown to have an inverse temperature transition that can be adjusted by non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the fourth position [2]. By combining polypeptide blocks with different inverse temperature transition values due to hydrophobicity differences, we expect to produce amphiphilic polypeptides capable of self-assembly into hydrogels. Our research examines the design, synthesis and characterization of elastin-mimetic block copolymers as functional biomaterials.

A strong, biodegradable, and biocompatible elastomer could be useful for fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and in vivo sensing [1,2]. We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tough biodegradable elastomer from biocompatible monomers. This elastomer forms a covalently crosslinked three-dimensional network of random coils with hydroxyl groups attached to its backbone. Both crosslinking and the hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups likely contributes to the unique properties of the elastomer.

Low surface thermal conductivity of 0.11 W/(m K) was measured for the IR receptor surfaces as compared to the nonspecific skin areas. This difference in surface thermal conductivity should result in a significant local temperature gradient around the receptor areas. Micromechanical analysis showed that pit organs were more compliant than surrounding skin areas with an elastic modulus close to 40 MPa. In addition, the maximum elastic modulus was detected for the outermost layer with gradually reduced elastic resistance for the interior. The porous microstructure of the underlying tissue combined with the highly branched microfibrillar network (Biomacromolecules 2001, 2, 757) is thought to be responsible for such a combination of biomaterial properties. Considering these biomaterials features, we postulated a possible design of an artificial photothermal detector inspired by the microstructure of natural receptors. This bioinspired design would include a microfabricated cavity filled with an ordered lattice of microspheres with a gradient periodicity from the surface to the interior. Such a ""photonic cavity"" could provide an opportunity for multiple scattering at wavelength tuned to 8-12 mum as a range of highest sensitivity.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; TM Microscopes, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 USA; USAF, Res Lab, MLPJ, Mat & Mfg Directorate, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA","Tsukruk, VV (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,30,26,26,0,18,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,JAN-FEB,2002.0,3,1,,,,,106,115,,10.1021/bm015591f,,,,10,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,528RJ,WOS:000174256500015,11866562.0,,,,2019-02-25

The sintering behavior of HA powders at different temperatures ranging from 850 degreesC to 1100 degreesC was studied. Results showed that spark plasma sintering resulted in rapid densification to near theoretical density. The HA compact was homogeneously sintered at 950 degreesC in a short sintering duration of 5 min. while maintaining high quality and high relative density (> 99.5%). The density, microhardness and Young's modulus of HA sintered compact initially increased with the sintering temperature, reached a maximum value at around 950-1000 degreesC. then decreased with further increase in the temperature due to the decomposition of HA into P-tricalcium phosphates. Fracture toughness results showed no significant difference with increasing temperature due to the combined influences of density and grain size. Microstructure analysis showed no noticeable grain growth under different sintering temperatures due to the short time exposure at high temperatures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, it cannot be excluded that the enhanced tissue repair is derived from host cells recruited to the defect in response to the implant, rather than the re-population of the tissue by the implanted MSCs. Our objective was to study the short-term fate of fluorescently labeled MSCs after implantation into full-thickness cartilage defects in vivo. The fluorescent dye used in our studies did not affect MSC viability or their ability to undergo osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in vitro. MSC/gelatin constructs were implanted into full-thickness cartilage defects in goats. These cells retained the dye and were detectable by histology and flow cytometry. At intervals spanning 2 weeks post-implantation we observed gradual loss of implanted cells in the defect as well as fragments of gelatin sponge containing labeled MSCs in deep marrow spaces indicating fragmentation, dislodgement and passive migration. Fluorescent labeling enabled us to determine whether the implanted cells were lost during early time points after implantation as well as their spatial orientation throughout the defect. By determining the fate of implanted cells, new biomaterials could be engineered to correct undesirable characteristics. Testing of new biomaterials in short-term in vivo models would provide faster optimization for cell retention needed for successful, long-term cartilage regeneration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SPUs were hydroxylated by potassium peroxodisulfate and MPC was grafted on the surface of hydroxylated SPUs using di-ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate (ceric ammonium nitrate, CAN) as a radical initiator, The bulk characterization of synthesized SPUs was investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). The existence of phospholipid analogous groups on the surface of these SPUs was revealed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements. The surfaces of MPC-grafted SPUs showed decreased water contact angles compared to non-grafted SPU and the presence of phosphorylcholine groups. The blood compatibilities of the new polymers were evaluated by platelet rich plasma (PRP) contact studies and viewed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using BioSpan (R) and non-grafted polyurethane as references. We found that fewer platelets adhered to the MPC-grafted surfaces and that they showed less shape variation than the references. These results suggest that these grafted polymers may have the possibility of the usage for biomaterials. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

On the contrary, the osteoblasts seeded onto TiO2/HA coating develop clusters where the cells aggregated extending processes in order to establish intercellular connections. Cell aggregation is an early and critical event leading to cell differentiation and mineralization process and could be a first signal of the tendency of Ti02/11A coating to stimulate cell differentiation, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Experiment design and results analysis are performed according to a two-level 2(k) factorial design method (FDM). Results indicate that only the weight fraction of pore-former (wt fpf) influences significantly the porosity and the compressive strength. The porosity P, is described by a linear function of wt fpf, and the compressive strength sigma (comp), by, an exponential one. For materials compacted tinder Uniaxial pressing: P (vol%) = 33.7 + 85.4 (wt fpf) and sigma (comp) (MPa) = 28.8 e(-9.2(wt) (fpf)) with 0.1 less than or equal to wt fpf less than or equal to 0.3. For materials compacted in isostatic mode: P (vol%) = 33.9 + 82.1 (wt fpf) and sigma (comp) (MPa) = 24.0 e(-7.0(wt) (fpf)) with 0.15 less than or equal to wt fpf less than or equal to 0.35, The pore-former particle size has no significant influence on both properties. The increase in isostatic pressure provides slightly lower porosity and better compressive strength. For a fixed fraction of pore-former, isostatic pressing leads to a better compressive strength than uniaxial pressing. This study indicates that, for a constant amount of pore former, the size of macropores can be adjusted to reach optimal bone-ingrowth without change in compressive strength.

Responses were determined separately and in combinations, to examine interactions between different forms of biomaterials. Murine air pouches were injected with particle suspensions, and reactions evaluated using histological, immunological, and molecular techniques. All particulate biomaterials caused significant increases in membrane thickness compared with control (saline) air pouches, with the highest reaction seen in response to Ti-6Al-4V particles. A synergistic increase in membrane thickness was observed when PMMA was combined with UHMWPE, suggesting that multiple biomaterial stimuli markedly increase the inflammatory reaction. Cellular analysis indicated that all particles increased the absolute number and the percentage of macrophages in the membrane over the control level, with the most pronounced increase due to individual biomaterial occurring with UHMWPE particles. Cytokine analysis revealed that biomaterials provoked a strong IL-I response. Ti-6Al-4V stimulated the highest IL-6 gene transcription and the lowest IL-I gene transcription. The data suggest that synergism in the inflammatory response to biomaterials may be important in adverse responses to orthopaedic wear debris. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ATH graft density (1.98 x 10(-7) mol/m(2)) was 6 times the maximum amount of unfractionated heparin (UFH) that could be bound to polycarbonate urethane surfaces, Surface-bound ATH could be stored in sterile 0.15M NaCl at 4 degreesC for at least 2 months with good antithrombotic activity before being implanted into rabbits. Analysis of ATH-coated tubing showed that it contained significant direct thrombin inhibitory activity. In vivo testing in a rabbit model was compared to non-activated non-coated surfaces, activated-non-coated surfaces, hirudin-coated surfaces and antithrombin (AT)-coated surfaces. The weight of the clot generated in the ATH-coated graft tubing was significantly less than the weight of the clot generated within the hirudin-coated graft (p = 0.03 with a 1-tailed Student's t test). The anticoagulant nature of ATH grafts in vivo was shown to be due to bound ATH because both the AT-coated surfaces and non-coated but activated surfaces showed similar thromboresistant efficacy to that of untreated material (ANOVA; p < 0.05). Apart from the direct antithrombin activity that contributed to much of the prolonged patency in vivo, surface-bound ATH likely catalyzed AT inhibition of thrombin, as evidenced by a significant number of I-125-AT binding sites (greater than or equal to1.5 x 10(-8) mol/m(2)). Thus, ATH appears to be a good candidate for coating cardiovascular devices, such as endoluminal grafts, with high levels of substitution and significant long-term blood-compatibility.

The mechanical performance was assessed by tensile tests and discussed on the basis of the respective interfacial morphology (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy). The main relevant parameters were found to be the surface properties and reactivity of the filler (non-sintered HA) and the chemical nature (pH and type of metallic centre) of the added coupling agent. Significant improvements in the stiffness were achieved (about 30% increase in the modulus) when using the acidic zirconate coupling agents. The acidic zirconate combined the capability of crosslinking the polymer matrix with the establishment of donor-acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonding between it and the ceramic particles, leading to very good interfacial adhesion. The optimization of these coupling processes associated with the introduction of higher amounts of filler, may be an effective way to produce composites with mechanical properties analogous to those of the human cortical bone.

The influence of stress state during fixation may play a substantial role in their failure, linking fatigue damage caused by buckling and tension and the enzymatic degradation of glutaraldehyde-crosslinked collagen. Bovine pericardia were obtained immediately postmortem and 100mm x 15 mm samples were cut in the base-to-apex direction. Half the samples were subjected to a uniaxial tensile stress of 250 kPa and half remained unloaded during a crosslinking treatment in 0.5% glutaraldehyde. Tissue samples were rinsed and cut into 16 mm x 4 mm test strips. Half of these strips were exposed to cyclic compressive buckling and alternating tension at 30Hz for 20 million cycles (appprox. 7.5 days) using a custom-built multi-sample fatigue system. Fatigue-damaged and non-damaged samples were subsequently incubated at 37 C for 48hrs in: (i) Type I bacterial collagenase (20U/ml) buffered in 0.05M Tris, 10mM CaCl2 2H(2)O (pH 7.4.) or (ii) 0.05M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) only. In both cases, the samples were loaded sinusoidally between 40 and 80g using a previously described microtensile culture system. Tissue removed from the bath was rinsed in 0.1 M EDTA solution and mounted in a servo-hydraulic mechanical testing system (NITS). Ultimate tensile strength (UTS), maximum tissue modulus, and fracture strain were determined. The percent collagen solubilized was assessed by a colourmetric hydroxyproline assay of the enzyme bath and tissue sample. All data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results confirmed the synergy between fatigue damage and collagenase proteolysis in these materials; however, there were no significant differences in this effect between simple fixation and stress-fixation up to 20 million cycles. There were significant decreases in the mechanical properties and an increase in the amount of collagen solubilized with increased exposure to fatigue cycling.","Dalhousie Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada","Margueratt, SD (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, 5981 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,INSTRUMENT SOC AMER,RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK,"67 ALEXANDER DR, PO BOX 12277, RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC 27709 USA",0067-8856,,1-55617-787-9,BIOMED SCI INSTRUM,,,2002.0,38,,,,,,145,150,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation",Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,BX29J,WOS:000184842900024,12085592.0,,,,2019-02-25

This ceramic material has the ability to interact with and bond to the surrounding tissue. Therefore, ceramics can serve as scaffolds for tissue growth. The objective of this study was to determine if ceramics formulated with amino acid binders can enhance and support cell growth. A total of 147 tubes containing 1 x 10(5) MRC5 cells were divided into seven equal groups. Group I served as control, Groups II-VI were incubated with ceramics containing amino acid binders (ASP, CYS, HIS, LYS, or SER, respectively) and Group VII served as ceramic without binder control. Equal numbers of tubes were terminated from each group at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cell numbers, morphology and markers of cell damage were determined at each time point. Results indicated: 1) Total cell numbers at 24 hours were increased in all experimental groups when compared with control. Increased levels of MDA were associated with control cells. 2). At 48 hours the total cell numbers in comparison to the control cells were increased in all groups with the exception of HIS. In addition to cell number, cellular adhesion was also increased in the experimental groups compared with the control. Significant increases in MDA levels were detected at 24 hours in the CYS treated cells. 3). Cellular adhesion in the experimental groups was increased over the control, but the total cell number was only increased in the ceramic material groups containing CYS and LYS. Cells exposed to ceramics with SER as a binder showed decreased cell numbers as well as increased MDA levels at this time point in comparison to control and other binders. Morphological evaluation of the cells showed amino acid binders with acidic side chains caused an increase in the presence of spindled shaped cells. Neutral side chains resulted in cells with elongated appearances, and basic side chains caused the cells to be less elongated. In conclusion, amino acid binders are able to induce the cells to adhere, proliferate and affect their morphological appearance as early as 24 hours.","Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Orthoped, Jackson, MS 39216 USA","Ward, J (reprint author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Orthoped, 2500 N State St, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.",,,,,,,8,0,2,0,0,INSTRUMENT SOC AMER,RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK,"67 ALEXANDER DR, PO BOX 12277, RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC 27709 USA",0067-8856,,1-55617-787-9,BIOMED SCI INSTRUM,,,2002.0,38,,,,,,197,202,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation",Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,BX29J,WOS:000184842900032,12085601.0,,,,2019-02-25

Cellular attachment, viability and growth were monitored in parallel cultures of human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG63, HOS TE85, SaOS-2) and primary human osteoblast-like cells (HOBs). Culture plastic was either left untreated or roughened with abrasive paper of various grit sizes (4000 1200 grit) in order to obtain a level of roughness comparable to that of the dentin slices. Cell counting and intracellular BCECF staining showed that after an initial incubation of 2 h, the primary cells attached and spread out more quickly on the different substrates than the three cell lines. The primary cells also showed a stronger mitochondrial staining and viability on dentin. During subsequent culture morphological differences appeared with the cells on dentin displaying more cellular extensions. All three cell lines proliferated more slowly on dentin than on plastic. In contrast, the primary HOBs were not significantly affected in their growth by the different substrates. Total and specific alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of the cell lines was not significantly affected by the different substrates after short-term adhesion, but it was increased for the primary cells on the dentin. However, after 2-3 days of culture, AP was decreased on the dentin slices for both the cell lines and primary HOBs. Plasma treatment of the roughened plastic did not alter cellular viability or AP activity, suggesting that grinding of the surface did not affect the property of the culture plastic to support cell attachment and growth. In conclusion, the results show that not only do osteoblastic cells behave differently on a natural calcified substrate surface than on standard culture plastic, but also that differences were evident between the various cell types, in particular the primary HOB versus the continuous cell lines.

In this study we evaluated if ectopic bone formation could be induced by a construct made of human periosteal cells and a novel scaffold architecture whose mechanical properties are in the range of cancellous bone. Biopsies from human calvarial periosteum were harvested and cells were isolated from the inner cambial layer. Fifty thousand periosteal cells were seeded into the scaffolds measuring 6 x 6 x 2 mm. The cell-scaffold constructs were cultured for a period of 3 weeks prior to implantation into bulb C nude mice. Mice were sacrificed and implants Acre analyzed 6 and 17 weeks postoperatively. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the osteoblastic phenotype of the seeded cells. Formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers could be observed in both scaffold architectures. Three-dimensional cell proliferation was observed after 2 weeks of culturing with centripetal growth pattern inside the pore network. The deposition of calcified extracellular matrix was observed after 3 weeks of culturing. In vivo, endochondral bone formation with osteoid production vas detectable via on Kossa and Osteocalcin staining after 6 and 17 weeks.

Based on detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of the local plastic deformation and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the residual stresses, the improvement in fatigue strength by shot peening in pure titanium was primarily attributed to compressive residual stresses and deformation twins induced at near surface layer. The microstructure of pure titanium formed by aligned martensite plates, while in shot peening specimens, high density dislocations, deformation twins and deformation bands formed in the strengthened surface layers. Compressive residual stress occurred, and then partially relaxed under fatigue loading.

However, PEUs can induce tumors in subcutaneous implantation sites in rat. We have shown that the different inhibitory potential of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) on the surface of the biomaterials, including PEUs, is a key step in determining the tumorigenic potential. Here we show that suppression of a gap junctional protein connexin 43 (Cx43) plays an important role in in vivo tumorigenesis induced by PEUs for the first time and that Cx43 transfection may be an effective strategy for preventing tumorigenesis induced by biomaterials. Rat tumor cell line U41 is derived from tumors in the subcutaneous implantation of PEU films. The GJIC and the expression of Cx43 were suppressed in U41. The restoration of normal phenotype, such as reduction of growth rate, recovery of contact inhibition and loss of colony formation ability in soft agar, was achieved by Cx43 transfection. These results strongly suggest that suppression of Cx43 expression plays an important role in the development of rat malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFHC) caused by PEUs and that Cx43 transfection is effective for prevention of tumorigenesis induced by PEUs.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,38,2,2,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-9069,,,CYTOTECHNOLOGY,Cytotechnology,,2002.0,39,1,,,,,1,8,,10.1023/A:1022430021868,,,,8,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,646MN,WOS:000181039000001,19003298.0,,,,2019-02-25

Preliminary results revealed that 4-META/MMA-TBB resin (4-META resin) penetrates pulp tissue when applied to the vital pulp in vivo or in vitro. The 4-META resin does not inhibit the osteogenic activity of pulp tissue and thus the 4-META resin can serve as a fundamental material for bioengineering.

All these things are argued to be found in biological systems as well. These systems are supposed to be sustainable, for they have been existing for hundreds of millions of years. If this is true one should find out how biological systems really work in terms of material usage and sustainability. This paper is concerned with stiff structural biomaterials like bone, wood, horn and chitin. It's objective is to find out if there are correlations between the energy effort to build up these materials in situ and the time period in which they are used. Also the relations between these two parameters and the time it takes to recycle the materials is treated. In theory organisms have to be energy efficient and therefore it can be expected that those materials storing more energy are used for a longer period. Most of the time this is true, but not always. There is a broad range in the time period in which different biomaterials are used in organisms with extremes from a few days to thousands of years. Also, the energy needed to build up materials is varying considerably and preformed resources are used to a certain extent. It can also be expected that materials with a high energy content are more likely to be reused as such. Therefore, they should be protected from degradation in one way or another. Some biomaterials however, are very persistent and do take a long time to be recycled. The emphasis of this paper is to find out correlations and patterns that can be applied in sustainable product design.","Vienna Univ Technol, Ctr Appropiate Technol, Vienna, Austria","Drack, M (reprint author), Vienna Univ Technol, Ctr Appropiate Technol, Vienna, Austria.",,,,,,,29,1,1,0,3,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1478-0585,,1-85312-901-1,DESIGN NATURE,,,2002.0,3,,,,,,369,378,,,,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,BV93N,WOS:000180452100037,,,,,2019-02-25

Tissue is a complex three-dimensional structure that contains many different biomaterials such as cells, proteins, and extracellular matrix molecules that are ordered in a very precise way to serve specific functions. In order to replicate such complex structure, it is necessary to have a tool that could deposit all these materials in an accurate and controlled fashion. Most methods to fabricate living three-dimensional structures involve techniques to engineer biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolding, which is then seeded with living cells to form tissue. This scaffolding gives the tissue needed support, but the resulting tissue inherently has no microscopic cellular structure because cells are injected into the scaffolding where they adhere at random. We have developed a novel technique that actually engineers tissue, not scaffolding, that includes the mesoscopic cellular structure inherent in natural tissues. This approach uses a laser-based rapid prototyping system known as matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation direct write (MAPLE DW) to construct living tissue cell-by-cell. This manuscript details our efforts to rapidly and reproducibly fabricate complex 2D and 3D tissue structures with MAPLE-DW by placing different cells and biomaterials accurately and adherently on the mesoscopic scale.","USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA","Ringeisen, BR (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, 4555 Overlook Ave SW,Code 6372, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-634-6,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,2002.0,698,,,,,,329,341,,,,,,13,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,BU86W,WOS:000177251300043,,,,,2019-02-25

Studies on effects of glass transition, T(g), on such reactions as nonenzymatic browning, oxidation, and enzymatic changes have often provided controversial information of various effects of the T(g), temperature, and water on the reaction rates. It is well known that rates of several reactions in low-moisture and frozen foods are significantly reduced, providing enhanced stability. However, both food systems show rapid changes in reaction rates above some critical water content or temperature. In several cases, these critical parameters have been related to the T(g). Other changes, such as crystallization and structural transformations, may also occur in low-moisture and frozen foods, resulting in more severe changes in the rates of chemical and enzymatic reactions. For example, crystallization of amorphous lactose has been shown to accelerate nonenzymatic browning in dairy powders or to affect the rates of enzymatic changes in food models. We, among others, have shown that nonenzymatic browning may occur at temperatures below the T(g). although at significantly lower rates than above the calorimetric T(g). There is, however, a change in the reaction rate constant within the glass transition temperature range. Our recent results suggest that phase separation of food components may allow reactions to occur below the T(g). In more homogeneous systems, an increase in the reaction rate correlates with the endset of the glass transition. This increase in the reaction rate seems to correlate with observed increases in molecular mobility, as derived from dielectric measurements. In both low-moisture and frozen systems, the pH, temperature, viscosity, and water content, in addition to the glass transition, are likely to affect rates of physicochemical changes.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Cork, Ireland","Roos, YH (reprint author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Cork, Ireland.",,"Roos, Yrjo/A-8162-2012",,,,,51,1,1,0,1,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",,,1-56676-963-9,FOOD PRESERV TECHNOL,,,2002.0,,,,,,,67,86,,,,,,6,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Food Science & Technology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Food Science & Technology,BU68M,WOS:000176705200006,,,,,2019-02-25

Biomaterials were produced from gel-derived powders by the hot-pressing process.

The ability of formation of an apatite-like layer was examined in cell-free ""in vitro"" conditions (contact of materials with simulated body fluid SBF) as well as by the examination of mineral deposits formed on the surface of these materials as a result of bone marrow cell culture. FTIR and EDAX methods were used for the identification of layers forming on the surface of biomaterials. It has been found that only A2 material is able to form an apatite-like layer during immersion in SBF. On the other hand, the mineralised nodules identified as calcium phosphates, formed as a result of bone marrow cell culture, were found on no-bioactive S2 material as well as on A2 sinters. Hence, it may be postulated that the bone-forming behaviour of osteoblastic cells on the biomaterials is not strictly related to their bioactivity.","Univ Min & Met Krakow, Fac Med Sci & Ceram, Dept Glass & Enamels, Krakow, Poland; Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Anim Biochem, Krakow, Poland","Cholewa-Kowalska, K (reprint author), Univ Min & Met Krakow, Fac Med Sci & Ceram, Dept Glass & Enamels, Krakow, Poland.",,,,,,,11,1,1,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",1013-9826,,0-87849-882-6,KEY ENG MAT,,,2002.0,206-2,,,,,,1559,1562,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.206-213.1559,,,,4,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science,BT32X,WOS:000172651400380,,,,,2019-02-25

The piezoelectric effects are believed to be significant to the growth and repair of biological tissues. Research on the application of piezoelectric materials as implant is being actively investigated. These materials, including ceramics and polymers, have dominated the application.

Linkages between VAMAS and international standards organizations such as ISO and IEC have been established. The work of VAMAS is carried out within Technical Working Areas (TWA=s). There are currently nineteen TWA=s addressing a wide range of material subjects, e.g. surface chemical analysis, ceramics, biomaterials, superconducting materials, metal matrix composites, thin films, etc, Each TWA is led by an individual from a VAMAS member country and can consist of multiple projects, each addressing a different aspect of the subject. Much of the work of projects consists of interlaboratory studies involving researchers from government, industry, and academia. Participants in these studies come from both VAMAS as well as non-VAMAS countries, For qualified participants, the only requirement is active involvement in the work of the project. In this paper, we will provide a number of examples of the benefits derived from VAMAS. For instance, VAMAS activities have facilitated the development of over 60 draft or adopted national, regional, and international standards. Databases and classification systems have been established. Standard Reference Materials have been developed. Finally, new directions for VAMAS are discussed.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA","Freiman, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,AMER CERAMIC SOC,WESTERVILLE,"735 CERAMIC PLACE, WESTERVILLE, OH 43081-8720 USA",1042-1122,,1-57498-147-1,CERAM TRANS,,,2002.0,133,,,,,,251,258,,,,,,8,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science,BW65W,WOS:000182709000034,,,,,2019-02-25

The coating procedure was classical enamelling. The metals were coated by either immersion or by painting over a thin layer from a mixture of frit (having the best composition for each metallic support) with a liquid mixture (triethanol amine: ethyl alcohol = 1: 10), mixture which was subsequently fired at the enamelling temperature. A good adherence between the two different materials has been thus achieved. Vitroceramic coating metallic support couples were then characterized by optical microscopy (OM), electronic microscopy (EDS) and wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The adherence of the vitroceramic layers onto metallic supports was tested by microhardness trials at the interface. The processes at the interface, i.e. gas bubble evolution, micropore formation, chemical bonding and diffusion, were evidenced. These coating layers can be employed as both bioactive and biocompatible materials.","IG Murgulescu Romanian Acad, Inst Phys Chem, Bucharest, Romania; Politecn Univ Bucharest, Sci & Engn Mat Fac, Bucharest, Romania; Aviat Met METAV SA, Bucharest, Romania",,,"BRANZEI, MIHAI/C-7101-2012",,,,,16,0,0,1,3,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA AEROPORT,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG 110 AVE LOUSIS CASAI CP 306, CH-1215 GENEVA AEROPORT, SWITZERLAND",0268-1900,,,INT J MATER PROD TEC,Int.

Materials and Methods: Nine ovariectomized and 9 sham-aged rats were used. Four months later, nails were implanted in the distal femurs, and the animals were sacrificed after 8 weeks. Moreover, 3 ovariectomized and 3 sham-aged sheep were used. Twenty-four months later, screws were implanted in the tibial diaphyses and the animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks. Results: Histomorphometry showed the development of osteopenia in both trabecular and cortical bone, and revealed a significant decrease in the osseointegration rate in osteopenic versus sham-aged animals for both trabecular (Affinity Index: -18.6%, P < .001) and cortical bone (Affinity Index: -23.5%, P < .005; Bone Ingrowth: -9%, P < .05). At the interfaces of the sham-aged animals in both trabecular and cortical bone, a decrease of bone microhardness was observed in comparison with preexisting bone (trabecular: -9.8%, P < .0005; cortical: -19.3%, P < .0005). In case of osteopenia, this decrease was even more extensive (trabecular: -15.5%, P < .0005; cortical: -24.7%, P < .0005). Discussion: The present data suggest that bone formation around Ti6Al4V was not associated with complete bone maturation, even in healthy animals. In case of osteopenia, both bone formation and maturation were delayed. Conclusion: These results apparently demonstrate the utility of investigating biomaterials in osteopenic bone and the importance of careful evaluation of the healing rate and bone maturation degree around implanted biomaterials.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Res Inst Codivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; Univ Milan, Dept Oral Med & Pathol, Milan, Italy; Univ Bologna, Fac Med, Bologna, Italy","Fini, M (reprint author), Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Res Inst Codivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",milena.fini@ior.it,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016; Cochis, Andrea/U-5264-2018","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Cochis, Andrea/0000-0003-2455-8239; RIMONDINI, LIA/0000-0002-7785-2282; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,61,35,38,1,6,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

The determination of physicochemical parameters such as hydrophobicity or surface tension is usually done at room temperature, not taking into account the real temperature at which bacteria cause infection inside the human body. In this work, the influence of the experimental temperature on the surface physicochemical characteristics and adhesion behaviour of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212 to glass and silicone has been studied. Water, formamide and diiodomethane contact angles on bacterial lawns changed when the experimental temperature was increased from 22degreesC to 37degreesC. Moreover, hydrophobicity, as determined by water contact angle, increases with temperature, in agreement with the higher and lower adhesion to silicone and glass, respectively, observed at 37degreesC, with respect to the results at 22degreesC. Also, when the formamide and diiodomethane contact angles are considered, the changes in the adhesion behaviour to glass and silicone are predicted by the sum of Lifshitz-van der Waals and acid-base interaction free energies if the measurement temperature is the same as the bacterial growth temperature, i.e. 37degreesC.","Univ Extremadura, Dept Phys, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; Univ Extremadura, Dept Microbiol, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain","Gonzalez-Martin, ML (reprint author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Phys, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",,"Morales Bruque, Jose/N-2521-2014","Morales Bruque, Jose/0000-0002-9336-4350; Perez-Giraldo, Ciro/0000-0002-2358-1982; GOMEZ GARCIA, ANTONIO CANDIDO/0000-0003-4495-9937",,,,25,6,6,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0169-4243,,,J ADHES SCI TECHNOL,J.

All the experiments were carried out on PUs films obtained by solvent casting. The wettability of these films was analysed by measuring static contact angles against water. The ability of the selected PUs to adsorb human fibronectin (Fn) and fibrinogen (Fbg) was checked by ELISA with biotin-labelled proteins. All PUs were able to adsorb Fn and Fbg (Fn > Fbg). Fn adsorption was in the order: Pellethane > Chronoflex > Bionate, the highest Fbg adsorption being detected onto Bionate (Bionate > Chronoflex > Pellethane). The human macrophagic line J111, and the two main bacterial strains responsible for infection in humans (Staphylococcus aureus Newman and Staphylococcus epidermidis 14852) were incubated in turn with the three PUs, uncoated or coated with plasma proteins. No macrophage or bacterial adhesion was observed onto uncoated PUs. PUs coated with plasma, Fn or Fbg promoted bacterial adhesion (S. aureus > S. epidermidis), whereas macrophage adhered more onto PUs coated with Fn or plasma. The coating with Fbg did not promote cell adhesion. Pellethane showed the highest macrophage activation (i.e. spreading), followed, in the order, by Bionate and Chronoflex.","Univ Pavia, Dept Biochem, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; Politecn Milan, Dept Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",,,"Fare', Silvia/F-6484-2013; Petrini, Paola/A-3150-2013; Tanzi, Maria Cristina/I-4620-2013","Petrini, Paola/0000-0002-5081-5254; Tanzi, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-4913-6633; Fare', Silvia/0000-0002-0303-1131",,,,63,14,14,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"6 BONHILL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4PU, ENGLAND",0885-3282,,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

Compared with the untreated films, no significant difference in cell attachment of osteoblasts was found on the modified films at a period of 8 h (p > 0.05). However, cell proliferation of N-butyl chitosan rather than N-cetyl chitosan modified PDLLA films was significantly higher than that found on control one (p < 0.05) at the end of the 4th and 7th days. The cell viability of osteoblasts on N-butyl chitosan modified PDLLA films were found higher than that on control (p < 0.05).

Biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. Surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. The bacteria used were; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus B-13. Initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. The adhesion behaviour of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. However, the percentage of attached E. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while L. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. The comparative results indicated that the adhesion of BHK and MDBK cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic PHEMA surface and highest oil the most hydrophobic PP surface. In contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.","Hacettepe Univ, Dept Chem Engn, TR-06532 Ankara, Turkey","Gumusderelioglu, M (reprint author), Hacettepe Univ, Dept Chem Engn, TR-06532 Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,,30,35,36,2,32,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

However, uncertain long-term biostability in the human physiological environment limits their extensive clinical applications. Chronic inflammatory response associated with macrophage activation has been suggested as a prime factor; although the mechanism of macrophage activation in response to biomaterial surfaces and debris is still unknown. The overall objective of this work was to study the response of macrophages to PU materials in vitro by measuring cell viability and activity. The studies were carried out using phagocytozable-size PU particles from three types of commercially-available PUs: Pellethane(R) 2363 80ABA (PL); Tecothane(R) TT2065 (TC65); and Tecothane(R) TT2085 (TC85). These polymers posess the same generic composition but differ in the length of hard and soft segments, as revealed by the FTIR and NMR studies. The results showed that PU particles affected both viability and activity of J774 macrophages. The percentage of mortality ranged front 1 to 15% with 10-100 mugml(-1) of particles after 24 and 48 h incubation. These three types of particles induced different mortality on the macrophages. Specifically, the mortality with PL particles was 1-4% (p > 0.05), while the mortality with TC85 particles was 2-10% (p < 0.05) and 4-15% with TC65 (p < 0.05). Conversely, these particles also affected cell proliferation. Cell numbers increased by 132 and 167% after 24 and 48 h incubation, respectively, without particles, whereas the cell numbers increased only 46 and 78% with TC65, 66 and 105% with TC85, and 67 and 110% with PL in the presence of 100 mug ml(-1) of particles for the respective incubation times. PU particles also increased TNF-alpha release from macrophage. After having been incubated for 24 h with 100 mug ml(-1) particles of TC65, TC85, and PL, macrophages release TNF-alpha 7.4, 5.2, and 4.1 times more than the control. In conclusion, PU particles had cytotoxic effects on J774 macrophage at high concentrations. The order of macrophage response for three types of particles was TC65 > TC85 > PL. PU particles' effect on macrophage viability and activity depends on the concentration of particles and their chemical composition, especially on the ratio of hard to soft segments.","McGill Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; Ecole Polytech, GRBB, Inst Biomed Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; McGill Univ, Lady Davis Inst Med Res, Div Orthoped Surg, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada","Tabrizian, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 3775 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.",,,,,,,50,13,13,0,4,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

PEO-like polymerized tetraglyme surfaces were made by glow discharge plasma deposition onto fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer (FEP) substrates and were shown to adsorb less than 10 ng/cm(2) of fibrinogen in vitro. The ability of the polymerized tetraglyme surfaces to resist leukocyte adhesion was studied in vitro and in vivo. Polymerized tetraglyme and FEP were implanted subcutaneously in mice and removed after I day or 4 weeks. Histological analysis showed a similar degree of fibrous encapsulation around all of the 4-week implants. Darkly stained wells were present in the fibrous tissues at the tissue-material interface of both FEP and tetraglyme. Scanning electron micrographs showed that in vivo macrophage adhesion to polymerized tetraglyme was much higher than to FER After 2-hour contact with heparinized whole blood, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to polymerized tetraglyme was much higher than to FEP, while platelet adhesion to polymerized tetraglyme was lower than to FER When PMNs isolated from blood were suspended in 10% autologous plasma, cell adhesion to polymerized tetraglyme was higher than to FEP; however when the cells were suspended in heat inactivated serum, cell adhesion to FEP was higher than to polymerized tetraglyme. The surface chemistry of polymerized tetraglyme did not change after 2-hour blood contact, but displayed nitrogen functional groups after 1-day implantation and became slightly degraded after 4-week implantation. The surface chemistry of FEP did not change significantly after blood contact or implantation. Loosely bound proteins such as fibrinogen on polymerized tetraglyme may contribute to the adhesion of PMNs and macrophages and ultimately to fibrous encapsulation (the foreign body response) around the implants.","Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,40,211,218,5,65,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) are surface sensitive techniques capable of detecting adsorbed proteins. We have investigated the lower limits of detection of both XPS and ToF-SIMS on four model substrates each presenting unique challenges for analysis by XPS and ToF-SIMS: mica, poly(tetrafluoroethylene), allyl amine plasma polymer and heptyl amine plasma polymer. The detection limit for XPS ranged from 10 ng/cm(2) of fibrinogen (on mica) to 200 ng/cm(2) (on allyl amine plasma polymers). The detection limit for ToF-SIMS ranged from 0.1 ng/cm(2) of fibrinogen to 100 ng/cm(2), depending on the substrate and data analysis. Optimal conditions provided detection limits between 0.1 ng/cm(2) and 15 ng/cm(2) on all of the substrates used in this study. While both techniques were shown to be effective in detecting protein, the sensitivity of both XPS and ToF-SIMS was, shown to be dependent on substrate surface chemistry and the organization of the adsorbed protein film.

Limitations still exist however, related to blood reactions at the biomaterial surface, such as cell activation, inflammation and low-grade thrombosis. In this brief review, the thought processes which paralleled the development of CPB biocompatible surfaces such as heparin-coating, will be explored, as well as current theories on the suspected mechanisms by which heparin-coated surfaces act as an anti-inflammatory device during CPB. Results with new surfaces for CPB designed to capitalize on superior protein adsorption properties, such as surface modifying additive (SMA) and poly (2-methoxyethylacrylate) (PMEA), will also be described.

It has recently been shown that adsorbed fibrinogen undergoes biologically significant conformational changes with increasing residence time on the surface of selected biomaterials. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of co-adsorbed proteins and shear forces on such time-dependent functional changes in fibrinogen adsorbed onto polyethylene (PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and silicone rubber (SR). Fibrinogen was adsorbed onto these materials for I min and then allowed to 'reside' on these surfaces for up to 2 h prior to assessing its biological activity. Changes in fibrinogen reactivity were determined by measuring the adhesion of Cr-51-labeled platelets and the ability of blood plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen. The magnitude of platelet adhesion to substrates adsorbed with pure fibrinogen increased in the presence of shear, compared with static conditions; at the lowest shear rate of 200 s(-1), samples exhibited a 20-fold increase in adhered platelet levels. In contrast, at a higher shear rate of 1000 s-1, the three polymers supported minimal levels of platelet attachment. Surfaces pre-adsorbed with 10% plasma did not promote a significant increase in the number of adherent platelets with increasing shear when compared with the pure fibrinogen-coated substrates. The presence of shear also significantly altered the materials' ability to retain fibrinogen. Under static conditions, the amount of fibrinogen retained following incubation in blood plasma increased on all materials with increasing fibrinogen residence time. However, the materials varied distinctly in their ability to retain adsorbed fibrinogen with increasing fibrinogen residence time, shear rate, and nature of the co-adsorbed proteins. Thus, the results from this study indicate that fluid shear, residence time of the adsorbed protein, nature of the co-adsorbed proteins, and surface chemistry of the material all play important roles in influencing platelet-surface interactions and that they act in a complex manner to influence the biocompatibility of a material.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Balasubramanian, V (reprint author), CUNY Mt Sinai Sch Med, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1269, New York, NY 10029 USA.",Viji.Balasubramanian@mssm.edu,,,,,,22,17,17,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

For polymer synthesis, the dendrimers were protected with either t-boc or Fmoc groups and were incorporated into the polyurethane microstructure to permit further functionalization with biologically active groups. Following deprotection, the dendrimers were reacted with succinimidyl propionate polyethylene oxide (SPA-PEO) to improve the protein resistance of the polymers and to examine the potential of this technique for polymer functionalization. Different synthesis techniques were examined to optimize the incorporation of the PEO into the polymer microstructure. Incorporation of the dendrimers and the PEO were confirmed by NMR and FTIR. Gel permeation chromatography was used to examine the molecular weights of the various polyurethanes. The dendrimer incorporated polymers had significantly lower molecular weights than the ED or BDO chain extended controls, likely due to lower reactivity of the dendrimers as a result of steric factors. Following PEO reaction, the molecular weights of the resultant polymers were consistent with the levels of PEO incorporation noted by comparison of peak intensities in the NMR spectra. Due to the highly hydrophilic nature of the PEO, some migration to the polymer surface was expected. Water contact angles and XPS, used to characterize the surfaces, suggest that there was some PEO enrichment at the surface of the polymers. Adsorption of radiolabeled fibrinogen to the polymer surfaces was decreased by a factor of approximately 40% in some of the PEO incorporated polymers. There were also differences in the patterns of plasma protein adsorption on the various surfaces as evaluated by SDS PAGE and immunoblotting. Therefore, the use of dendrimers in biomaterials for incorporation of a large number of functional groups seems to be promising.","McMaster Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada; McMaster Univ, Dept Pathol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada; McMaster Univ, Dept Mol Med, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Inst Eye, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Dept Chem Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Sheardown, H (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada.",,,"Griffith, May/0000-0003-1222-6720",,,,33,4,4,0,8,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Films formed by an increasing number of layers were investigated. The terminating layer was made of one of the following polyelectrolytes: poly-sodium-4- styrenesulfonate (PSS), poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA), poly-allylamine hydrochloride (PAH), or poly(L-lysine) (PLL).

From a biomaterial application standpoint, the relationship between the reaction conditions, polymer structure. and final physical properties is important, particularly for in situ formed materials, as they must have optimum network properties immediately after formation. However, multifunctional monomer reaction mechanisms are complicated by mobility restrictions on the reacting species, cyclization of pendant groups, unequal reactivity of functional groups, and structural heterogeneities. Also. experimental characterization of these complexities is difficult and limited by the insolubility of the resulting cross-linked structure. Thus, in this contribution, a kinetic gelation simulation was used to understand and characterize the evolution of in situ forming, three-dimensional polymer structures. Specifically. the reaction of tetrafunctional monomers (i,e. divinyl monomers) to form high strength networks with degradable cross-links was modeled.

Further, it measures the damping energy (i.e. viscoelasticity) of the adsorbed layer. Four different surfaces where studied: Heparin (Hep) surface as an active inhibitor of clot formation, titanium (Ti) surfaces that are known to activate the intrinsic pathway, polystyrene (PS) surfaces and poly(urethane urea) (PUUR) surfaces. The experiments were initiated by applying citrated human plasma at the sensor surfaces; calcium was then added to initiate coagulation. The Hep surfaces showed no apparent indication of clot formation during one hour of incubation at room temperature. However, on Ti surfaces we observed an early and rapid change in both frequency shift and viscoelastic properties of the coagulating plasma. We inhibited the intrinsic pathway activation by using corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI), which is specific for factor FXIIa in the bulk phase, which prolonged the coagulation times for all non-heparinized surfaces. We have also found a peculiar initial plasma protein interaction phenomenon on Ti surfaces. The described methodology would be very efficient for basic studies of surface associated coagulation and as a screening method for new biomaterials.","Univ Gothenburg, Lundberg Lab, Dept Cell & Mol Biol Interface Biophys, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Surg Sci, Dept Biomat, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Andersson, M (reprint author), Univ Gothenburg, Lundberg Lab, Dept Cell & Mol Biol Interface Biophys, Box 462, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,30,20,20,1,14,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Nevertheless, their blood compatibility is still not adequate for more demanding applications. Surface modification is an effective way to improve the hemocompatibility for biomaterials. The purpose of the present study was to synthesize a novel nonthrombogenic biomaterial by modifying the surface of polyurethane. Ozonization was used to introduce active peroxide groups onto the segmented poly (ether-urethane) (SPEU) film surface and graft polymerization of N,N'-dimethyl (methacryloyloxyethyl) ammonium propanesulfonate (DMAPS), a sulfobetaine structure. onto the ozone-activated SPEU surface was conducted. The SPEU-g-PDMAPS film was characterized by ATR-FTIR. XPS, and contact angle measurements. ATR-FTIR and XPS confirmed the graft polymerization, The grafted film possessed a relatively hydrophilic surface. as revealed by contact angle measurement. The blood compatibility of the grafted films was evaluated by a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) adhesion study and scanning electron microscopy, using SPEU film as the reference. No platelet adhesion was observed for the grafted films incubated with PRP at 37degreesC for 60 and 180 min. This new sulfobetaine structure grafted biomaterial might have potential for biomedical applications.","Nanjing Univ, Ctr Res Surface & Interface Chem Engn & Technol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Shen, J (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Ctr Res Surface & Interface Chem Engn & Technol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,27,58,61,0,33,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

These materials combine the desired polypeptide proper-ties of biocompatibility. biodegradability, non-toxicity, and non-immunogenicity with good processing properties including solubility, thermal stability. and moldability which a-rise from alternating non-amide bonds along the polymer backbone. This paper focuses on the analysis of two such polymers based on the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. Starting from L-tyrosine and its deaminated analogue, 3-(4-para-hydroxy)-phenylpropionic acid. a diphenolic structure containing an amide linkage, was synthesized following standard procedures of peptide synthesis. This diphenolic structure was then used as a monomer to synthesize a polyiminocarbonate using a cyanogen bromide-initiated reaction and a polycarbonate using a triphosgene-initiated reaction. The polyiminocarbonate has iminocarbonate linkages and the polycarbonate has carbonate linkages alternating with amide linkages in the respective polymer backbone. Analytical studies were performed regarding the feasibility of the reaction procedures. the physical proper-ties of the polymers. and their degradation processes, to gain insight into the potential biomaterial applications of these polymers. These results independently reaffirm the studies published by Kohn et tit. working on similar polymeric systems.","Univ Akron, Dept Chem Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA; Univ Akron, Dept Biomed Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Lopina, ST (reprint author), Univ Akron, Dept Chem Engn, Olson,Rm 301K, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",,,,,,,18,16,16,0,9,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Porous biomaterials allow bone integration to be increased, especially when the pores are interconnected. In this study, three types of porogens (sugar fibers. sucrose crystals. and urea beads) have been used to prepare macroporous pHEMA. The pore volume and interconnectivity parameters of the porosity were measured by X-ray microtomography and image analysis. Sucrose crystals, having a high volumetric mass, gave large pores that were located on the block sides. Urea beads and Sugar fibers provided pores with the same star volume (2.65 +/- 0.46 mm(3) and 2.48 +/- 0.52 mm(3) respectively) but which differed in interconnectivity index, fractal dimension, and Euler-Poincare's number. Urea beads caused non-connected porosity. While sugar fibers created a dense labyrinth within the polymer. Interconnectivity was proved by carrying out Surface treatment of the pHEMA (carboxymethylation in water), followed by von Kossa staining, which detected the carboxylic groups. Carboxymethylated surfaces were observed on the sides of the blocks and on the opened or interconnected pores. The disconnected pores were unstained. Macroporous polymers can be prepared with water-soluble porogens. X-ray microtomography appears a useful tool to measure porosity and interconnectedness.","Fac Med, Lab Histol Embryol, LHEA, GEROM, F-49045 Angers, France; CHU Angers, F-49045 Angers, France; Fac Med, Serv Commun Imagerie & Anal Microscop, F-49045 Angers, France; Le Trianon, Angers, France; Univ Politechn, Bucharest, Romania","Chappard, D (reprint author), Fac Med, Lab Histol Embryol, LHEA, GEROM, F-49045 Angers, France.",daniel.chappard@univ-angers.fr,,,,,,44,25,25,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

L-Arginine was immobilized to the hydroxyl groups of a-cyclodextrins in the polyrotaxane via an ester linkage, and the nitric oxide generation and L-arginine release behavior were characterized. L-Arginine-immobilized polyrotaxane was insoluble in water, but was found to generate nitric oxide when placed in Tris-HCl buffer supplemented with activators. L-Arginine-immobilized polyrotaxane exhibited sustained nitric oxide generation for a period of 250 h. L-Arginine was completely released by non-enzymatic hydrolysis from 200 h to 700 h, with a lag-time for the first 200 h. Consequently, after the generation of nitric oxide and the release of L-arginine from the L-arginine-immobilized polyrotaxane, the residual component will be a polyrotaxane with superior biocompatibility and mechanical properties. These results suggest that L-arginine-immobilized polyrotaxane can be useful in a wide range of medical applications, including use as a nitric oxide generative system for antithrombosis, coating and blending materials of hydrophobic extracorporeal circuits, and implantable catheters.","Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci, Tatsunokuchi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan; Ajou Univ, Dept Mol Sci & Technol, Paldal Gu, Suwon 442749, South Korea","Yui, N (reprint author), Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci, Tatsunokuchi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.",,"Kobe Univ, Engineering/D-2028-2017; Ooya, Tooru/C-5573-2012",,,,,22,6,6,1,4,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Gelatin granules hydrate, swell and solubilize in water, and rapidly degrade in vivo. The durability of these materials could, however, be prolonged by cross-linking by aldehydes, carbodiimides, and aldose sugars, but the biocompatibility of collagenous biomaterials is profoundly influenced by the nature and extent of cross-linking. In this study, gelatin sponges were prepared by using various crosslinkers such as glutaraldehyde (GA), 1-ethl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC), and D-fructose. The effects of the type and the amount of cross-linker on thermal and mechanical properties. stability, and cytotoxicity were investigated. The mechanical analysis data showed that an increase in the amount of GA in the sponge structures caused a slight increase in the modulus of elasticity but had almost no effect on the tensile strength. Increase in the EDAC concentration produced a maximum in the modulus of elasticity and tensile strength values. The stability of the sponges and the time required for complete degradation in aqueous media increased in parallel with the cross-linker content. In vitro studies carried out with fibroblast cells demonstrated a higher cell viability for the samples cross-linked with low concentrations of GA than for those crosslinked with EDAC.","Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Chem, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; Hacettepe Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Basic Pharmaceut Sci, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; Ege Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Bioengn, TR-35000 Izmir, Turkey; Baskent Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey","Hasirci, N (reprint author), Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Chem, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",nhasirci@metu.edu.tr,"SERBETCI, KEMAL/P-9528-2016","SERBETCI, KEMAL/0000-0002-6646-5252; HASIRCI, Nesrin/0000-0002-4497-0194",,,,51,75,77,4,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In the present work, we use a frequency-domain dielectric spectroscopy approach to evaluate possible changes in the passive electrical parameters of the erythrocyte membrane, i.e., the membrane conductivity sigma (s) and the membrane permittivity epsilon (s), after the insertion of a prosthesis (mean implantation time 8 days) in the circulatory system of patients treated for aortic aneurysm and the consequent interactions of erythrocyte cells with the biomaterial surface. We observe an increase of both the membrane conductivity and membrane permittivity, indicating changes at molecular level in the structural organization of the membrane. These membrane alterations can be viewed as precursory events for the initiation of the complex sequence of enzymatic reactions that take place on the material surface. Our results, although preliminary imply that a direct interaction between erythrocyte cell membrane and vascular prostheses may occur, causing a marked alteration in the electrical properties of the cell membrane. These findings might have relevant clinical implications and might offer possibilities to predict biocompatibility of biomaterials and give some further suggestions to resolve the problem of biomaterial-associated thrombogenicity.

Strategies have been sought to enhance endothelialization using growth factors and cytokines. This study assessed the biologic activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) covalently linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Native and modified VEGF were assayed for endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Migration assays were performed comparing the effects of 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, and 200 ng/mL of native VEGF and VEGF-BSA. Proliferation assays were performed by using Alamar Blue comparing cellular growth in 1% FBS, 10% FBS, 100 ng/mL unbound VEGF, and 100 ng/mL VEGF-BSA. VEGF is a potent chemotactic agent for endothelial cells in both unbound and bound states. Native VEGF solutions (50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, and 200 ng/mL) stimulated 23.9 cells/high power field (HPF), 35.3 cells/HPF, and 49.1 cells/HPF (12 < 0.005). VEGF-BSA solutions stimulated 25.9 cells/HPF, 39.1 cells/HPF, and 69.0 cells/HPF (p < 0.001). VEGF-BSA and native VEGF supported similar increased cellular proliferation compared with 1% FBS media (p < 0.002). Modified VEGF retains its chemotactic and proliferative properties in vitro.

Trabecular bone chips were harvested from human iliac crests, and cell cultures were established at standard conditions, One hundred and fifty nanograms per milliliterof rhBMP-7was added, For the second passage a cell scraper was used to bring the cells into suspension, and 100 mul osteoblasts (at a density of 3.3 x 10(5)) were transferred onto nine blocks of either Bio-Oss((R)), Tutoplast((R)), or PepGen p-15(TM). Blocks incubated with cells that were not treated with rhBMP-7 served as controls. Cell colonization of the biomaterials was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after a period of 2, 4, and 6 weeks. Throughout the experiment medium, supernatants were collected and collagen was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Finally, the collagen cross-link residues hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline(LP) were quantified by HPLC. Within 4 weeks the cells became confluent on all of the studied biomaterials. All samples synthesized bone specific LP and collagen type 1. However, in rhBMP-7-stimulated samples, the amount of HP and LP found was increased by 45% compared to non-stimulated samples. Cell proliferation and collagen synthesis was similar on the different biomaterials, but was consistently reduced in specimen not stimulated with rhBMP-7. In vitro stimulation of osteoblasts on Bio-Oss, Tutoplast, or PepGen p-15 with rhBMP-7 and subsequent transplantation of the constructs might lead to an enhanced osseointegration of the biomaterials in vivo.

A 200-bp fragment displaying upregulated expression after 30 and 60 min adhesion was isolated, sequenced, and showed 97% homology to prtb, previously showed to be expressed in mouse brain. Northern analysis confirmed a twofold increase in prtb message during adhesion to tissue culture polystyrene, both in the presence or absence of surface-adsorbed serum proteins. Serum stimulation alone was also able to induce prtb expression, although to a lesser extent, in suspension cells. Strong prtb expression was also detected in both brain and bone of adult rats. Furthermore, prtb expression analysis during MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation revealed high expression levels independent of proliferation (day 0-7), matrix maturation (day 7-14), and mineralization (day 14-31). Time course analysis of prtb expression during adhesion of sensitized osteoblasts to serum-protein coated surfaces showed robust mRNA expression at 5 min post-plating and a peak at 10 min. The two known serum-inducible immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun showed similar expression kinetics, with c-jun mRNA levels peaking at 15 min and c-fos at 20 min. Based on these data, we hypothesize that prtb may function as an immediate early, serum-responsive, and adhesion-inducible gene with possible involvement in processes such as cell cycle control, adhesion, and proliferation.

Background: No systematic review of treatment outcomes in patients who received graft biomaterials or biological agents have been published. Methods: A rigorous systematic review of randomized controlled trials of at least 6-month duration was conducted comparing grafting biomaterials/biological agents (alone or in combination) + OFD (test group) to OFD alone or in combination with a placebo (control group). Results: The difference in CAL change between test and control groups varied from -1.45 mm to 1.40 mm with respect to different biomaterials/biological agents. Meta-analysis showed that CAL change significantly improved after treatment for coralline calcium carbonate (weighted mean difference 0.90 mm; 95% CI: 0.53-1.27), bioactive glass (weighted mean difference 1.04 mm; 95% CI: 0.31-1.76), hydroxyapatite (weighted mean difference 1.40 mm, 95% Cl 0.64-2.16), and enamel matrix proteins (weighted mean difference 1.33 mm, 95% CI 0.78-1.88). However, heterogeneity in results between studies was highly statistically significant for most of biomaterials/biologicals and could not be fully explained. Conclusions: Overall, the use of specific biomaterials/biologicals was more effective than OFD in improving attachment levels in intraosseous defects. Difference in CAL gain varied greatly with respect to different biomaterial/biological agent. Due to a significant heterogeneity in results between studies in most treatment groups, general conclusions about the expected clinical benefit of graft biomaterials/biologicals need to be interpreted with caution. Further research should focus on understanding this variability.","Univ Ferrara, Res Ctr Study Periodontal Dis, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; Univ Bern, Dept Periodontol & Fixed Prosthodont, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; UCL, Eastman Dent Inst, Dept Periodontol, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Eastman Dent Inst, Dept Oral Pathol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Trombelli, L (reprint author), Univ Ferrara, Res Ctr Study Periodontal Dis, Corso Giovecca 203, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",l.trombelli@unife.it,"Trombelli, Leonardo/I-4671-2015","Trombelli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1147-2199; Moles, David/0000-0001-9797-6226",,,,70,145,147,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0303-6979,1600-051X,,J CLIN PERIODONTOL,J.

The precipitate is a self-assembled nanocomposite material with two clearly distinct phases: an amorphous (from silica gel) and a crystalline metal-carbonate phase. These materials usually called induced morphology crystalline aggregates (IMCA) represent a plausible model for experimental simulations and for the understanding of biomineralization processes in nature. In this contribution, we show how these aggregates are obtained. We also show how the typical morphology is modified due to the influence of 20 L-amino acids that are usually present in proteins. We have also introduced the first structural characterization using atomic force microscopy and image analysis in order to describe the IMCA from the theoretical and the experimental point of view. Finally, the results are compared with those images found in nature formed by means of biomineralization in living organisms (such as calcite crystals present in avian eggshells).

The incorporation of glycerol into a soy-based matrix resulted in its plasticization, as confirmed by the drop in stiffness (storage and elastic modulus) above 20degreesC and a decrease in the protein glass transition temperature. Differential scanning calorimetric thermograms proved the occurrence of conformational changes in the soy protein during processing. Furthermore, the developed soy protein-based thermoplastics showed a thermal stability up to 100degreesC, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis, The reinforcement of the soy protein matrix with a ceramic filler (tricalcium phosphate) was shown to be effective for amounts above 10% w/w. The introduction of an amino-coupling agent led to a plasticizing effect, detected in the mechanical and dynamic-mechanical properties of the resulting materials. The results also show a good qualitative agreement between the properties obtained from quasi-static and dynamic experiments.

The toxicity of these materials is often due to the presence of GTA residuals unremoved by washing procedures. In this study membranes of PVA-hyaluronic acid and PVA-gellan with different composition have been obtained by solution casting technique and crosslinked by exposure to vapors of GTA in acid environment. The harmful effects of GTA residuals released from the membranes have been evaluated by the cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility in vitro tests, based on the cell culture method. The results showed that these materials have no toxic effects: they do not affect cell viability and proliferation, nor exert damages on mithocondrial and lysosomal functions. The poor adhesion of cells seeded directly onto membranes is due to the surface properties of these materials which are completely refractory at cell adhesion and proliferation. The use of GTA in vapor phase as crosslinking agent of natural and artificial polymer blends is demonstrated to be an efficacious procedure that avoids the presence of toxic residuals into materials.

Microsphere(MS)s having reactive surfaces could be prepared using poly(LA-random-depsipeptide). Polydepsipeptide-block-PLA was convenient for preparation of MSs and polymeric micelles having highly reactive surfaces. It was found that the degradability and mechanical property of PLA could be controlled by introduction of branch points into PLA using comb-type PLA or branched PLA.

A method is described for determining trace amounts of RR120 dye contaminant in human serum albumin by cathodic stripping voltammetry. The method is based on a measure of a well-defined peak at -0.58 V, obtained when samples of HSA protein (0.01-2% w/v) containing dye concentrations are submitted to a heating time of 330 min at 80degreesC in NaOH, pH 12.0 and the samples are removed to a solution containing Britton-Robinson buffer, pH 4.0. Using an optimum accumulation potential and tune of 0 V and 240 s, respectively, linear calibration curves were obtained from 1.0 X 10(-9) to 1.0 X 10(-8) mol 1(-1) for RR120 dye. Leakage/hydrolysis of reactive red 120 from an agarose support (e.g. at pH 2 or 12) can also be conveniently determined at very low levels (sub-mug ml(-1)) by means of cathodic stripping voltammetry, which involves adsorptive accumulation of the dye onto the hanging mercury-drop electrode.

One group of animals was exposed immediately after surgery and every 12 h thereafter to 30-min treatments with electromagnetic fields (PEMFs). A second group was used as a control (untreated). Two and 4 weeks after implantation, animals were sacrificed and bone samples processed for LM, TEM and SEM using a backscatter electron detector for the evaluation of bone growth.

Several characterization methods were used. The effects of varying the synthesis conditions on the size and the morphology of the powder were analyzed with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The crystallinity and phase purity were determined by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. The particle sizes were measured by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Precipitation from aqueous solution yielded particles with rod-shaped and amorphous morphology, whereas precipitation from a micro-emulsion resulted in rod-shaped crystals and after tempering in amorphous shapes.

The patterned surface was subsequently exposed to 100 nm unilamellar lipid vesicles that bound to the native oxide surfaces of silicon and spread to form supported lipid bilayers. The nanoscale pattern is realized as the polymer is peeled away in deionized water. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by the successful preparation of functionalized lipid bilayer surfaces.

It is an informal movement and the concept itself is so loose that one might wonder whether biomimetism is more than a slogan forged by chemists in order to hop on the ""green"" bandwagon.

Experimentally find a method to provide a safe surgical technique and an inexpensive and long lasting mesoplant for the restoration of vision in patients with bilateral corneal blindness due to ocular surface and stromal diseases. Methods. Identify the least invasive and the safest surgical technique for synthetic cornea implantation. Identify the most compatible biomaterials and the optimal shape a synthetic cornea must have to last a long time when implanted in vivo. Results. Penetrating procedures were deemed too invasive, time consuming, difficult and prone to long term complications. Therefore a non-penetrating delamination technique with central trephination was developed to preserve the integrity of Descemet's membrane and the anterior segment. Even though this approach limits the number of indications, it is acceptable since the majority of patients only have opacities in the stroma. The prosthesis was designed to fit in the removed tissue plane with its skirt fitted under the delaminated stroma. To improve retention, the trephination wall was made conical with the smallest opening on the anterior surface and a hat-shaped mesoplant was made to fit. The skirt was perforated in its perimeter to allow passage of nutrients and tissues ingrowths. To simplify the fabrication procedure, the haptic and optic were made of the same polymer. The intrastromal biocompatibility of several hydrogels was found superior to current clinically used PMMA and PTFE materials. Monobloc mesoplants made of 4 different materials were implanted in rabbits and followed weekly until extrusion occurred. Some remained optically clear allowing for fundus photography. Conclusions. Hydrogel synthetic corneas can be made to survive for periods longer than 1 year. ArF excimer laser photoablation studies are needed to determine the refractive correction potential of these mesoplants. A pilot FDA clinical trial is needed to assess the mesoplant efficacy and very long-term stability.","Univ Miami, Ophthalm Biophys Ctr, Sch Med, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Parel, JM (reprint author), Univ Miami, Ophthalm Biophys Ctr, Sch Med, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,,,,,,19,1,1,0,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4350-6,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2002.0,4611,,,,,,123,128,,10.1117/12.470584,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Ophthalmology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Ophthalmology; Optics; Physics,BU92M,WOS:000177417400018,,,,,2019-02-25

The five factors investigated were the molar ratios of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)/Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), Toluene/PLLA, EtOH/TEOS, Water/TEOS and HCl (catalyst)/TEOS. All other synthesis conditions were kept constant. X-Ray powder diffraction (Statton's graphical method) and differential scanning calorimetry were used to assess the extent of polymer crystallinity in the hybrid materials. In accordance with other studies, increasing the molar ratio of TEOS/PLLA lead to increasing incorporation of the organic polymer into the silica network. Increase of the toluene/PLLA molar ratio lead to an increase in the crystallinity of the polymer phase. As our studies investigated the effect of synthesis variables simultaneously it was possible to identify, for the first time, that interactions between specific reactants are important in the development of the two structural components of this hybrid system. The most important of these was the TEOS/PLLA*H2O/TEOS interaction that may indicate that silica species from hydrolysed TEOS interact with the PLLA phase possibly via hydrogen bonding and leads to the lowering of the crystalline order of the polymer The results from this study give useful information on the ability of the organic polymer and the silica phase to form interpenetrating networks, an important requirement for the generation of a potential hybrid polyester-silica biomaterial for orthopaedic applications.","Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Phys & Chem, Nottingham NG11 8FU, England","Perry, CC (reprint author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Phys & Chem, Nottingham NG11 8FU, England.",,,"Eglin, David/0000-0002-8500-6887; Perry, Professor Carole/0000-0003-1517-468X",,,,33,5,6,0,0,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOC,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-662-1,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,2002.0,726,,,,,,67,78,,,,,,12,"Materials Science, Composites; Polymer Science",Materials Science; Polymer Science,BV44F,WOS:000178977700009,,,,,2019-02-25

First, ceramic and polymeric materials were compounded under high shear using a torque rheometer. Compounded materials were then extruded to a 1.78mm diameter continuous filament using a single screw extruder. These filaments were used as a feedstock material for an FDM 1650 machine for direct fabrication of controlled porosity parts. Hg-porosimetry was done to determine pore size and their distribution in these structures. Tensile properties of neat composites and as received polymer were measured and compared using standard dog bone samples. Uniaxial compression tests were performed on cylindrical porous samples having average pore size of 160 mum and 36 vol% porosity. These samples showed an average ultimate compressive. strength of 12.7 MPa. Average compressive modulus was calculated as 263 MPa.

Tissue is a complex three-dimensional structure that contains many different biomaterials such as cells, proteins, and extracellular matrix molecules that are ordered in a very precise way to serve specific functions. In order to replicate such complex structure, it is necessary to have a tool that could deposit all these materials in an accurate and controlled fashion. Most methods to fabricate living three-dimensional structures involve techniques to engineer biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolding, which is then seeded with living cells to form tissue. This scaffolding gives the tissue needed support, but the resulting tissue inherently has no microscopic cellular structure because cells are injected into the scaffolding where they adhere at random. We have developed a novel technique that actually engineers tissue, not scaffolding, that includes the mesoscopic cellular structure inherent in natural tissues. This approach uses a laser-based rapid prototyping system known as matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation direct write (MAPLE DW) to construct living tissue cell-by-cell. This manuscript details our efforts to rapidly and reproducibly fabricate complex 2D and 3D tissue structures with MAPLE-DW by placing different cells and biomaterials accurately and adherently on the mesoscopic scale.","USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA","Ringeisen, BR (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, 4555 Overlook Ave SW,Codes 6372 & 6115, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",,,,,,,40,0,0,0,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4376-X,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2002.0,4637,,,,,,341,352,,10.1117/12.470640,,,,12,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Optics; Physics,BU94R,WOS:000177443500037,,,,,2019-02-25

The MAPLE DW process is computer controlled which allows the sensor design to be easily modified and adapted to any specific application. To illustrate the potential of this technique, a functional chemical sensor system is demonstrated by fabricating all the passive and sensor components by MAPLE DW on a polyimide substrate. Additional devices fabricated by MAPLE DW including biosensors and temperature sensors and their performance are shown to illustrate the breadth of MAPLE DW and how this technique may influence current and future sensor applications.","USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA","Pique, A (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",,,"Arnold, Craig/0000-0002-0293-5411",,,,17,10,10,0,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4376-X,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2002.0,4637,,,,,,361,368,,10.1117/12.470642,,,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Optics; Physics,BU94R,WOS:000177443500039,,,,,2019-02-25

Such strategy was based on the use of patient own cultured bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in association with biomaterials to produce autologous living bone equivalents. When engineering such implants, three main factors had to be taken into account: (i) the cells, (ii) the culture technology and (iii) the biomaterial scaffolds. The capacity of BMSCs to proliferate, differentiate along the osteogenic lineage and form a bone like tissue was demonstrated in various in vitro assays making use of biochemical, immunological, microscopic and gene expression techniques. The ability of the cells to produce bone in vivo was established using an ectopic (extra osseous) implantation model. Results indicated that BMSC cultures were composed of a heterogeneous population containing a subpopulation of cells with high proliferative capacity and with potential to differentiate into bone forming cells. Both the growth and the differentiation pattern of these cells could be manipulated, to a certain degree, through the use of bioactive factors during culture. After implantation, the bone forming capacity of the cultures proved to be related to the amount of early osteoprogenitors and precursors cells that could be induced into starting the osteogenic differentiation process. In bone marrow aspirates, this subpopulation appeared to decrease with donor age and to be strongly dependent on the donor, indicating that the aspiration procedure plays an important role in the obtained bone marrow cell population. In order to evaluate the in vivo bone formation capacity of BMSC cultures prior to implantation, an experimental method was developed in which the amount of early osteoprogenitors and precursors cells could be quantified. With regard to the technology design, data indicated that the culture of cells on the biomaterial scaffolds prior to implantation resulted in implants with faster in vivo bone forming ability as compared to scaffolds implanted shortly after cell seeding. In addition, two biodegradable polymeric systems were proposed as scaffolds to be used in the described bone engineering approach after evaluating their ability to support bone marrow cell growth, differentiation and in vivo bone, formation. In summary, although the complete knowledge of the, factors controlling BMSC growth and osteogenic differentiation still needs to be further expanded, the obtained results suggest that the bone tissue engineering approach described in this work presents a great potential for the repair of bone defects and will become an advantageous alternative to the traditional autologous bone grafting.","IsoTis NV, NL-3723 MB Bilthoven, Netherlands","Mendes, SC (reprint author), IsoTis NV, Prof Bronkhorstlaan 10, NL-3723 MB Bilthoven, Netherlands.",,"Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012","Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456",,,,168,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1568-2609,,1-4020-1001-X; 1-4020-1000-1,NATO SCI SER II-MATH,,,2002.0,86,,,,,,265,298,,,,,,34,"Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,BV99N,WOS:000180622900015,,,,,2019-02-25

Development of biomaterials for tissue replacement raises the interest for testing polymers with storage modulus of less than 1 MPa. The development of specific testing methodologies with improved accuracy and precision for evaluating very soft polymeric materials are presented in this work.

Model reactions for evaluation of the activities of the biocatalysts were esterification of stearic acid with aliphatic alcohols in hexane, toluene and acetone and the hydrolysis of canola oil. In the first process, one step sol-gel technique, the enzyme was entrapped into silica prepolymers prepared from tetramethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane. The two-step process was based on immobilization by sorption of enzyme on fine inorganic particles and their subsequent entrapment into a silicone based polymer. In a typical example Lipolase100 L was sorbed on the surface of poly(methylhydroxysiloxane) particles that were entrapped into poly(dimethylsiloxane) and cross-linked. The biocatalysts were shaped by molding. The one- step biocatalysts were fragile and hard. Mechanical properties of the two-step biocatalysts were changed from the hard, high abrasion resistant material, to elastic rubber. The activities of two-step biocatalysts (22.5 mg(protein)/g(biocatalyst)) were proportional to their swelling of the biocatalyst in reaction media and were to a certain extent insensitive to modifications of the elasticity and dimensions of biocatalyst particles. In the esterification of stearic acid, the activity of two-step immobilized lipases was higher than that of the commercial sol-gel lipase Fluka.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Chem Proc Fundamentals, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic","Kuncova, G (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Chem Proc Fundamentals, Rozvojova 135, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",,"Sabata, Stanislav/H-3489-2014; Kuncova, Gabriela/H-3484-2014",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,BUNDESFORSCHUNGSANSTALT LANDWIRTSCHAFT (FAL),BRAUNSCHWEIG,"BUNDESALLEE 50, 38116 BRAUNSCHWEIG, GERMANY",,,3-933140-63-3,,,,2002.0,,,,,,,41,46,,,,,,6,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,BW59K,WOS:000182532400007,,,,,2019-02-25

Subsequent events include FXII autoactivation to the enzyme FXIIa and formation of a contact activation complex. Additional conversions result in the generation of thrombin and formation of an insoluble fibrin clot. This study examines the ability of a biomaterial to generate FXIIa and thrombin by comparing the procoagulant efficiency of glass beads to soluble aliquots of enzymes. FXIIa induced activation of coagulation saturates at surprisingly dilute concentrations (similar to0.5 mug/ml), and this effect is also seen in surface and thrombin induced contact activation. Preliminary analysis of data suggests that 50 turn 2 glass surface area generates the equivalent of 5 ng of FXIIa, or only similar to0.0125% conversion of physiologic concentration, as well as producing the equivalent of similar to2.65 units/ml of thrombin. Addition of procoagulant (glass) surface was also found to modulate a local minimum observed in FXIIa titration curves. The results observed with FXIIa and biomaterials suggest that an investigation of the mechanisms behind FXIIa and thrombin production by biomaterials, as well as a clearer understanding of how signals propagate down the pathway, are necessary for assembling a detailed mechanism for surface activation.","Penn State Univ, Dept Bioengn, Hershey, PA 17033 USA","Bussard, KM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Bioengn, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",,,"Bussard, Karen/0000-0002-6519-9300",,,,3,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-7419-3,,,,2002.0,,,,,,,129,130,,10.1109/NEBC.2002.999499,,,,2,"Engineering, Biomedical",Engineering,BU42Z,WOS:000175970000065,,,,,2019-02-25

Electrochemical corrosion tests were carried out using a three electrode electrochemical cell connected to a computer driven potentiostat. Corroded surfaces were analyzed by using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). To measure the thickness of the surface oxide layer, detailed observations were also performed by using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The ELID grinding condition strongly affected corrosion characteristics of the ground samples. When the voltage value of the ELID power was raised, oxygen concentrated on the ground surface. A thick and stable oxide layer was observed on the ELID ground surface and this layer led to a higher corrosion resistance of the ground samples.","Keio Univ, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan","Mizutani, M (reprint author), Keio Univ, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,AVIATION INDUSTRY PRESS,BEIJING,"14 XIAOGUAN DONGLI, ANWAI, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,7-80183-020-2,,,,2002.0,,,,,,,671,676,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,BW07B,WOS:000180780900123,,,,,2019-02-25

These ESR signal intensities at nearly g 2 decreased when the X-ray irradiated samples were soaked in the simulated body fluid. This fact suggests that the Surface layer contained a high density of ESR active species in all samples dissolved in the simulated body fluid. Furthermore, the fading of these ESR signal intensities was observed in all of the samples.

In contrast, in vivo tissue engineering relies on the body's natural ability to regenerate over non-cell-seeded biomaterials. Cells, biomaterials, and controlled incubation conditions all play important roles in the construction and use of modern in vitro systems for tissue engineering. Gene delivery is also an important factor for controlling or supporting the function of engineered cells both in vitro and post implantation, where appropriate. In this review, systems involved in the context of in vitro tissue engineering are addressed, including bioreactors, cell-seeded constructs, cell encapsulation, and gene delivery.

We seek to utilize expertise from the field of biomaterials to make synthetic vehicles that are less toxic, have higher transfection efficiencies, and have longer circulation times than traditional cationic polymers. Toward this goal, we have used poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the backbone for our gene delivery vehicle. A difunctional PEG backbone was coupled with DNA-binding peptides (DBPs) to create a DNA condensing polymer with much lower charge ratio (+/-) than traditional cationic polymers, thus reducing the cytotoxicity of the PEG-based vehicles versus traditional cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly-L-lysine (PLL). These DNA-binding moieties allow the PEG-based vehicles to condense DNA and self assemble into nanoparticles for gene delivery. Transfection efficiencies of these DBP-PEG vehicles were found to be comparable to other synthetic cation polymers. The self-assembling vehicles proposed above, provide a potentially non-toxic alternative to the currently available non-viral gene therapy agents.","Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Dempsey, LA (reprint author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1094-687X,,0-7803-7612-9,P ANN INT IEEE EMBS,,,2002.0,,,,,,,566,567,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Computer Science; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BV84T,WOS:000180194800273,,,,,2019-02-25

Integrin alpha(2)beta(1) recognizes the glycine-phenylaianine-hydroxyproline-glycine-glutamate-arginine (GFOGER) motif in type I collagen. Recognition is entirely dependent on the triple-helical conformation of the ligand similar to that of native collagen. This work focuses on engineering alpha(2)beta(1)-specific bioadhesive surfaces by immobilizing a triple-helical collagen-mimetic peptide incorporating the GFOGER binding sequence onto model non-adhesive substrates. Circular dichroism spectroscopy verified that this peptide adopts a triple-helical conformation in solution. Passively adsorbed GFOGER-peptide exhibited cell adhesion and spreading comparable to that observed on type I collagen. The involvement of integrin alpha(2)beta(1) in these adhesion events was verified with subsequent antibody blocking conditions and focal adhesion staining. Further experiments revealed alpha(2)beta(1)-mediated cell adhesion and focal adhesion formation on three immobilized peptide surfaces. These results suggest that this peptide is active in an immobilized conformation and may be applied as a surface modification agent to promote cell adhesion. This triple-helical collagen-mimetic peptide represents a versatile and robust approach to engineering alpha(2)beta(1)-specific surfaces for cell adhesion. Engineering surfaces that specifically target certain integrin-ligand interactions and signaling cascades allows us to optimize cellular response in biomaterials and tissue engineering applications.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Reyes, CD (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1094-687X,,0-7803-7612-9,P ANN INT IEEE EMBS,,,2002.0,,,,,,,572,573,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Computer Science; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BV84T,WOS:000180194800276,,,,,2019-02-25

NO is then released from the attached L-Cysteine and available to inhibit platelet deposition. The present study involves the characterization and optimization of the L-Cysteine-modifled polymers. The modified polymers are characterized by several methods, including a method developed by our group, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. The modified polymers are optimized by using a factorial design and varying the concentrations"" and reaction times of the species involved in the modification process. In addition to the L-Cysteine residues, a L-cysteine analogue and, a L-Cysteine polypeptide are attached to the polymer. The optimization process was used to determine the best method to attach the Most L-cysteine residues to the polymer that will result in the most free thiol groups available to transfer NO to and from the surface to prevent platelet deposition.","Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Gappa-Fahlenkamp, H (reprint author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1094-687X,,0-7803-7612-9,P ANN INT IEEE EMBS,,,2002.0,,,,,,,621,622,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Computer Science; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BV84T,WOS:000180194800300,,,,,2019-02-25

To this end, fibronectin was adsorbed to equivalent levels on copolymers based on a family of tyrosine/PEG derived polycarbonates. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed unique protein distributions for each copolymer system, indicating that although equal amounts of ligand are presented, the concentration of PEG in the underlying substrate can effect the adsorbed ligand. Consequently, quantitation of fibronectin RGD-binding sites on the protein-adsorbed copolymers revealed that cell-binding sites were maximized at intermediate concentrations of PEG. Our migration studies demonstrated that increasing PEG in the copolymer increased cell speed monotonically up to an intermediate PEG level where a maximum speed was reached. After incubating cells on ligand adsorbed copolymers, higher PEG levels elicited equivalent number of cell-binding sites relative to those on intermediate levels of PEG. Integrin inhibition studies showed that alpha(5)beta(1) was critical in modulating the number of RGD sites. Our AFM data suggests that rearrangement at higher PEG levels was facilitated by electrostatic repulsion, effecting fibronectin slippage at the polymer surface as well as conformational rearrangement revealing addition al RGD-binding sites. Overall, we report on the finding that cell migratory responsiveness to a given ligand concentration can be further manipulated via systematic ligand changes due to the substrate PEG composition.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA","Sharma, RI (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1094-687X,,0-7803-7612-9,P ANN INT IEEE EMBS,,,2002.0,,,,,,,765,766,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Computer Science; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BV84T,WOS:000180194800367,,,,,2019-02-25

We then investigate the behavior of hepatocytes on acellular cadherin-presenting immobilized microparticle-based biomaterials. Biologically activity of acellular cadherins is ensured by appending to the extracellular domain of E-cadherin to an immunoglobulin Fc region, which induces dimerization and specifically adheres to a Protein A coating on the microbeads. Hepatocellular function was elevated on these surfaces as compared to control, Fc presenting surfaces. Both surfaces exhibited similar cell adhesion and morphogenesis, suggesting that induction of hepatocyte function by cadherins was due to signaling activities rather than adhesive activities. Overall, we have demonstrated that functionalization of biomaterials with acellular cadherins is a powerful way to induce hepatocyte function.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA","Brieva, TA (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1094-687X,,0-7803-7612-9,P ANN INT IEEE EMBS,,,2002.0,,,,,,,778,779,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Computer Science; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BV84T,WOS:000180194800373,,,,,2019-02-25

This is especially true of the largest class of biomaterials in use, foods. They include general properties, e.g., food texture, and others, such as spreadability of margarine/butter, pourablity of ketchup, scoopablity of ice cream, and also flavour release (a problem that has much in common with drug delivery), to name but a few. Thus, most food laboratories do a large amount of work in rheology and microscopy to relate structure and properties. However, a knowledge gap exists, i.e., what is the location and quantity of ingredients/molecules within a structure? Both of these questions need to be answered if a complete understanding is to be obtained. The ""what is where"" question can sometimes be answered by using various microscopic labelling techniques, although there can be many problems with these methods. Bulk separation is often attempted, followed by some kind of more classical analysis, but this is often either not possible or may cause some kind of uncontrolled perturbation. Thus, the ability to obtain quantitative information in situ within a microstructure has been an unobtained goal in much of food science research. These types of questions are, of course, also asked in many related fields of research. This paper will illustrate how the advances in confocal Raman spectroscopy have allowed this problem to be tackled, in a non-invasive way. It will show how careful development of experimental procedures and advances in data analysis methods, allow even quantitative maps of microstructures to be obtained. The details of this approach will be described including a discussion of the limitations of current methods, especially depth resolution, and how these were overcome. The use of these methods will be illustrated with a gelled mixture of two carbohydrate polymers, kappa-carageenan and gellan. Despite being similar polymers, and hence having highly overlapping spectra, the pure spectral components can be separated using a chemometrics based method, multivariate curve resolution (MCR). The principles of this method will be described. Under certain concentration regimes these two biopolymers phase separate. This property can be used to produce different microstructures. Two different microstructures were produced and mapped using Raman spectroscopy. This data was analysed using the MCR method to show the relative locations of the two polymers within the microstructure. Furthermore, by augmenting the data from these maps with calibration data for the two bioploymers, quantitative maps were produced. The resultant concentrations can then be used to produce tie lines for the kappa-carageenan/gellan phase diagram, which is essential for understanding and manipulating the structure and properties in a systematic way. This methodology can be readily extended to much more complex multicomponent systems, such as complete food products. This paper shows that the combination of the confocal Raman spectroscopy and MCR data analysis methodology is very powerful and is readily applicable in many areas of research, especially the biomaterial/biomedical fields.","Unilever Bestfoods R&D, Colworth Lab, Sharnbrook MK44 1LQ, Beds, England; Unilever R&D US Edgewater Lab, Edgewater, NJ USA",,,,,,,,14,22,22,0,11,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0712-4813,,,SPECTROSC-INT J,Spectr.-Int.

Proteins play crucial role in almost every biological system. They are involved in enzymatic catalysis, transport and storage, coordinated motion, mechanical support, immune protection, control of growth and cell differentiation among many others. The immobilization of proteins onto surface functionalized substrates has been one of the most promising areas in bioengineering field. It is important to note that the term immobilization can refer either to a temporary or to a permanent localization of the biomolecule on or within a support. Proteins have very particular chain configurations and conformations that promote high levels of specificity during chemical interactions. In the present work, we aimed to study the phenomenon of protein immobilization onto biomaterial with chemically engineered surface. We have tailored the surface of the porous gels of SiO2 with 5 different silane surface modifying agents: tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane (ICPES). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the presence of all specific chemical groups in the materials. The surface functionalized gels were then immersed in porcine insulin (PI) solutions for protein immobilization. The incorporation of protein within the gels was also monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. The kinetics of protein adsorption and desorption from the gel matrix in vitro tests were monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. We could not observe any evidence of denaturation of insulin after its desorption from gel matrices using UV-visible spectroscopy technique. In vivo tests with adult male rats were used to verify the immobilized insulin bioactivity after implantation of different biomaterial with functionalized surfaces. Plasma glucose levels were obtained by using the Glucose GOD-ANA Colorimetric Assay. All surface modified materials have presented acute hypoglycemic peak response associated with the insulin bioactivity.","Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Vet Med, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",,,"Orefice, Rodrigo/N-8055-2018","Orefice, Rodrigo/0000-0002-6046-4056; Mansur, Herman/0000-0002-3032-495X; Lobato, Zelia/0000-0002-9399-3691",,,,17,40,41,1,17,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0712-4813,,,SPECTROSC-INT J,Spectr.-Int.

The core technologies pertinent to developing a bioartificial pancreatic substitute depend strongly on the type of cells used. These can be pancreatic islets, genetically engineered beta cells that proliferate in culture, and non-beta cells genetically engineered to secrete insulin in a glucose-responsive fashion. In our laboratory, we focus on beta insulinoma lines for use as allotransplants, and on potentially autologous non-beta cells genetically engineered for transcriptional control of insulin biosynthesis. We designed a system of betaTC3 mouse insulinomas encapsulated in calcium alginate/poly-L-lysine beads using diffusion/reaction models with experimentally measured parameter values. Its secretory response was characterized with a microperfusion apparatus, and its longer-term function with a perfusion bioreactor, which was NMR-compatible, thus allowing imaging and spectroscopic studies to be performed. Results show that the entrapped insulinomas constitute a dynamic construct, which, however, stabilize, at a metabolic and secretory plateau determined by the available oxygen in the surrounding milieu. Our on-going studies involve transcriptionally controlled recombinant non-beta cells, where the focus is on evaluating the dynamics of secretion and improving those by implementing genetic engineering and biomaterials approaches, and extending the NMR studies to in vivo systems, where the focus is on monitoring construct integration.","Georgia Inst Technol, Emory Ctr Engn Living Tissues, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Sambanis, A (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem Engn, 315 Ferst Dr,IBB Bldg,Room 1306, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,,,,,58,5,5,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0531-5131,,0-444-50933-X,INT CONGR SER,,,2002.0,1243,,,,,,5,18,,,,,,14,"Engineering, Biomedical; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,BV08H,WOS:000177772200002,,,,,2019-02-25

For this purpose, cellulose was chemically modified by phosphorylation. Once implanted, phosphorylated cellulose could promote the formation of calcium phosphates, thus having closer resemblance to bone functionality. In a previous investigation, the obtention and the preliminary characterization of cellulose phosphate gels were reported. In the present study, the synthesis by the H3PO4/P2O5/Et3PO4/hexanol method was optimized in terms of reaction parameters. The structure of materials was investigated by FTIR, Raman, and solid-state P-31- and C-13-NMR spectroscopic studies, and X-ray diffraction. Water swelling and stability to sterilization by gamma-radiation were also assessed. It was demonstrated that the present method allows highly phosphorylated cellulose derivatives to be obtained. Cellulose triphosphates gels are described here for the first time. Products obtained were poorly crystallized monoesters, apparently not significantly affected by gamma sterilization and showed a high water swelling capability.

It was envisaged to take advantage not only of its good matching with mechanical properties of bone but also of its hydroexpansivity, therefore allowing a satisfactory fixation to hard tissue. Both the osteoconduction and the lack of osteoinduction of this material were demonstrated. Grafting of phosphate groups was then envisaged as the means to render cellulose more suitable for orthopedic applications by enhancing its bioactivity. In the present work, the previously optimized phosphorylation reaction was successfully adapted to the surface modification of regenerated cellulose. Modified materials were characterized by XPS, FTIR, and P-31 MAS NMR spectroscopic studies, and contact angle measurements, revealing the chemical bond between phosphate groups and cellulose, as well as the hydrophilic nature of phosphorylated materials, which increases with increasing phosphate contents. Water swelling and resistance to gamma sterilization were assessed as well, showing that phosphorylated materials swell considerably in water and were not affected when sterilization was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The increase in surface roughness attributed to chemical modification was demonstrated through laser rugosimetry measurements.

The relative contribution of each phenomenon is unknown. Hollow fiber microdialysis probes were employed to assess the effect of subcutaneous implantation on glucose flux through polymeric membranes in rats over 8 days and to differentiate the transport effects of biofouling versus tissue changes. Three commercially available membranes were examined: poly(ether sulfone) (PES), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polycarbonate (PC). As measured by glucose recovery (the ratio of microdialysis glucose to blood glucose concentrations), transport through PES membranes was significantly less on day 2 than day 0 (39% decrease, p < 0.05) whereas PAN and PC showed no significant decreases in flux until day 8 (42 and 43%, respectively). Application of a transport model to glucose recovery data obtained before implantation in vivo and after explantation indicated that mass transport resistances originating from biofouling and tissue compartments increased between days 0 and 8. However, on average the biofouling layer adherent to the probe created substantially less resistance to glucose transport (12-24% of total) than did the tissue that surrounded the probe. These results suggested that future material developments for biosensors should be directed at understanding and modifying transport properties of tissues at the implant site.

Short (hour) and long-term (day) exposures were performed. Product ratios were used to determine surface hydrolysis of the polymeric materials. Enzyme kinetics were studied for the monomers when challenged by ACHE, CHE, and PRLE. In the case of PRLE, the V-max for the dimethacrylate substrates varied slightly, but amounted to as much as 10% of that of p-nitrophenylacetate. The K-m for triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was 197 muM for ACHE and 1107 muM for CHE. The V-max was 2.7 nmol/min for ACHE and 3.5 nmol/min for CHE. TEGDMA was converted by CHE at 2% the rate of cholesteryl oleate. Long-term incubations of monomers with CHE and ACHE produced degrees of hydrolysis that evidenced structure dependency in the ability of the enzymes to effect hydrolysis. Particularly resistant were aromativ derivatives and those with branching in methacrylate linkages. Overall, the study confirms the ability of physiologically important esterases to catalyze the hydrolysis of biomaterial methacrylates.

Linear aliphatic polyesters were chosen as the starting materials. The hydroxyl-terminated polylactide/epsilon -caprolactones (PBLC-OHs) were first synthesized by melt ring-opening copolymerization in the presence of benzyl alcohol and stannous octoate. PBLC-OHs were used as the precursor for the synthesis of double bond-functionalized polylactide/epsilon -caprolactones (PBLC-Mas) by reacting the hydroxyl end groups of PBLC-OH with maleic anhydride in melt at 130 degreesC. Acrylic acid/lactide/epsilon -caprolactone g-raft copolymers (PBLCAs) were then successfully carried out by the radical copolymerization of acrylic acid and PBLC-Ma initiated by azobisisobutyronitrile. Finally, nitroxyl radicals [4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy (TAM)] were incorporated into the carboxylic acid sites of the acrylic acid/lactide/epsilon -caprolactone copolymer (TAM-PBLCA) by reacting TAM with PBLCA in the presence of NX-carbonyl diimidazole. A high content of TAM was incorporated into the PBLCA copolymer. The polymers synthesized were characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR.

An in vitro biomechanical and radiographic study to evaluate the properties of a newly developed bioactive bone cement for stabilization of the fractured spine, suitable for minimally invasive application. Objectives. To determine the mechanical stability of the fractured spine after injection of the newly developed bioactive bone cement under quasi-static and cyclic loading regimens. Summary of Background Data. Bone cement injection has been reported as a potentially useful, minimally invasive technique for treating vertebral body fracture or stabilizing osteoporosis. However, potential problems associated with the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have prompted the search for alternative solutions, The use of bioactive bone cement as a potential replacement for PMMA has been reported. Methods. Biomechanical and radiographic analyses were used to test the mechanical stability of the fractured spine. The cement used was formed from hydroxyapatite powder containing strontium and bisphenol A diglycidylether dimethacrylate (D-GMA) resin. Twenty-six fresh porcine spine specimens (T10-L1) were divided into three groups: pilot, intact, and cemented. Spinal stiffness and failure strength were recorded in the intact group with the specimens flexed at 10degrees, Uniform injuries were created in all specimens of the cemented group, and compressive loading was applied with 10degrees of flexion until a fracture occurred. The bone cement was injected into the fractured spine, and stiffness was evaluated after 1 hour, Failure strength was also recorded after 3000 and 20,000 fatigue load cycles. Morphology of the specimens was observed and evaluated. Results. Results from a cell biocompatibility test indicated that the new bioactive bone cement was favorable for cell growth. Spinal stiffness significantly decreased after fracture (47.5% of intact condition). Instant stiffness of the spine recovered to 107.8% of the intact condition after bone cement injection. After 3000 and 20,000 cycles of fatigue loading, stiffness of the cemented spine was found to be 93.5% and 94.4% of intact stiffness, respectively (P< 0,05). Average failure strength of the spine was 5056 N (after 3000 cycles' and 5301 N (after 20,000 cycles) after bone cement injection and fatigue loading, Radiographs and cross-sectional observations indicated a good cement-bone bonding and fracture fill. Conclusions. A new bioactive bone cement without cytotoxic effect has been developed. Results show that minimally invasive techniques to apply this cement to porcine spines results in augmentation of mild burst fractures such that the original stiffness and strength of the vertebra are recovered. This new cement therefore shows potential as an augmentation to traditional instrumentation in the surgical management of vertebral fractures. The potential for further clinical applications is currently under investigation.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; First Mil Med Univ, Med Biomech Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Lu, WW (reprint author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"Cheung, Kenneth/0000-0001-8304-0419",,,,33,43,65,0,11,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,DEC 15,2001.0,26,24,,,,,2684,2690,,10.1097/00007632-200112150-00010,,,,7,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,508HG,WOS:000173082200009,11740355.0,,,,2019-02-25

We report that surface chemistry, preadsorbed proteins, and adhesion time all play important roles during monocyte adhesion bi vitro. The surface chemistry of tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), polystyrene, Primaria, and ultra low attachment (ULA) used for adhesion studies was characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Fibrinogen adsorption measured by I-125-labeled fibrinogen was the lowest on ULA, higher on TCPS, and the highest on polystyrene or Primaria. Monocyte adhesion on protein preadsorbed surfaces for 2 h or 1 day was measured with a lactate-dehydrogenase method. Monocyte adhesion decreased over time. The ability of preadsorbed proteins to modulate monocyte adhesion was surface dependent. Adhesion was the lowest on ULA, higher and similar on TCPS or polystyrene, and the highest on Primaria. Monocyte adhesion on plasma or fibrinogen adsorbed surfaces correlated positively and linearly to the amount of adsorbed fibrinogen. Preadsorbed fibronectin, immunoglobulin G, plasma, or serum also promoted adhesion compared with albumin preadsorbed or uncoated surfaces.

Widely used commodity polymers were the first polymers to be utilised in biomedical applications. These polymers were not developed with biocompatibility established at the onset and many speciality polymers have been developed in recent years to begin to meet the multifaceted demands for medical development, the optimisation of structure-property correlations and ultimately, clinical use. In the broader area of materials research, combinatorial or high throughput strategies used for drug development are recognised to have potential for discovery and process development. Much of the application of combinatorial chemistry in drugs research has been dependent on the use of polymeric reagents, substrates and supports. The chemistry of the reactions on polymers in solid and liquid phases have also played a major role in combinatorial drugs research. There is considerable interest in combinatorial materials research and this review outlines how this research may be applied for biomedical polymer development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The increase in carboxyl groups was from 26 +/- 14 (12 h of hydrolysis) to 134 12 (144 h of hydrolysis). Although collagen triple helix structure of polyanionic materials was preserved in all cases, a decrease in thermal stability and a gradual loss in the ability of collagen molecules to form fibrils were detected with increasing carboxyl content, probably as a result of changes in the pattern of electrostatic interaction, The resulting materials were basically acellular polyanionic collagen matrixes associated with an elastin content dependent on the time of hydrolysis. The results showed that the procedure described in this work may be a useful process for preparation of collagen biomaterials with variable physicochemical properties and macromolecular arrangement with respect to fibril formation and with potential use in tissue engineering.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim & Fis Mol, BR-13560970 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Goissis, G (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim & Fis Mol, Av Trabalhador Saocarlense 400,CP 780, BR-13560970 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,,,,,,29,35,37,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,WIN,2001.0,2,4,,,,,1074,1079,,10.1021/bm0001188,,,,6,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,528RH,WOS:000174256400003,11777376.0,,,,2019-02-25

Meningeal cultures in serum containing media were analyzed for attachment, spread cell area, proliferation, the production of extracellular matrix (ECM), and neuronal outgrowth. In general, both cell attachment as well as cell spread area decreased with increasing substrate hydrophobicity, whereas cell division as indicated by BrdU incorporation and time to confluence, was lower on the most hydrophobic materials. We suggest that such differences immediately after cell seeding were most likely mediated by differences in surface adsorption of proteins. In longer-term experiments, most of the materials were colonized by meningeal cultures irrespective of surface chemistry, and all cultures were equally inhibitory to neuronal outgrowth suggesting that over time, cells can modify the substrate perhaps by secretion of extracellular matrix molecule proteins. Our data suggests that cell type-specific differences in response to different biomaterials may play an important role in determining the Ultimate nature and composition of the CNS at the host-biomaterial interface.

However, obtaining uniform bioactive collagen films in the nanoscale range and precisely controlling the physical and chemical properties of these biological films is still a challenge for biomedical engineering. Layer-by-layer assembly, i.e., sequential adsorption of oppositely charged macromolecular species, is a powerful new film preparation technique that can be applied to the design of versatile biomaterials, with well-controlled interfacial, mechanical and biological functions. To demonstrate the feasibility of biomaterial design by means of layer-by-layer assembly, type-I collagen thin films were prepared by using this technique with poly(styrene) sulfonate as a partner polyelectrolyte. The gradual build-up of the collagen films was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy and ellipsometry, while their surface morphology was assessed by atomic force microscopy. The thickness of the collagen layers can be changed by increasing the number of bilayers adsorbed with an increment of 13 nm. It was found that the layer-by-layer assembled collagen scaffolds can support the attachment and growth of C2C12 myoblast cells and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Accurate thickness control and compatibility with nerve cell precursors indicate the utility of layer-by-layer assembled films in neuroprosthesis.","[Grant, Gregory G.

The results indicated the hydrophobic character of osteoblastic cells with a contact angle of 26.89 degrees (0.29 degrees). This value could explain the ability of osteoblasts to specifically attach onto hydrophobic surfaces like titanium or hydroxyapatite. The first cellular step of bone healing requires the presence of osteoblasts and their adhesion to biomaterial surfaces is the crucial phase of the osteointegration process. The presence of a monolayer of a newly discovered hydrophobic bacterial exopolysaccharide on coverglass slides appeared to strongly encourage adhesion of osteoblastic cells. In that, providing surfaces with this hydrophobic material induced a selective adsorption of osteoblast cells and might enhance osteo integration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterise the modifications. Such treatments could reduce device-related infection on medical devices. While changes in hydrophilicty, as noted by changes in the contact angle, were seen for the various gas plasma (CO2, H2O and NH3), these had little effect upon bacterial adhesion or antibiotic retention. An improvement was noted for antibiotic retention (ciprofloxacin) on the H2O-plasma treated polyurethane, attributable to the presence of -OH groups, however, this was small. These results suggest that other approaches for reducing device-related infection be examined, such as the direct attachment of a drug-delivery system. To accomplish this for the drug-delivery system of choice, which utilises diisocynate chemistry, the introduction of primary amine groups onto the surface is required. Radiofrequency (RF) and remote microwave (MW) systems were used to introduce these groups onto both the biomedical polymer directly, and an intermediate, ethylene-based, plasma deposited film. The use of such a film would allow this technology to be applied to a variety of different substrates as well as provide a solvent barrier and a means of surface stabilisation. The MW system was found to be superior over the RF system in terms of deposition rate of the polymeric film, the effectiveness of its barrier properties and for the introduction of a higher proportion of primary amine functionality onto the surfaces as determined by XPS. Finally, use of a model system, in conjunction with XPS, confirmed the ability of these modified surfaces to be fut-ther derivatised using the isocyanate chemistry associated with the drug-delivery system. The results indicate that electron spectroscopy and surface modification techniques play an important and critical role towards the development of antimicrobial coatings for medical devices.

In vitro cell activation of human neutrophils (Mac-1 upregulation) has been taken as one measure to assess the attributable risk of inflammation due to biopolymers before their clinical application. Mac-1 expression has generally been measured by flow cytometric assays, whereas quantification of neutrophil adhesion to the biopolymer surfaces has been performed by separate and time-consuming assays, e.g. microscopically by differential cell counting. However, due to an increasing number of surface-modified novel biopolymers entering clinical usage, effective testing of their inflammatory potential is now mandatory. To facilitate these analyses, we have developed a novel flow cytometric assay pennitting simultaneous measurement of biopolymer-mediated neutrophil activation and adhesion. The biopolymers were used as beads (diameter 25 +/- 10 mum), and were demonstrated to be non-phagocytosable and non-fluorescent before being co-incubated with whole human blood (range of ratio granulocytes/beads from 5:1 to 1:1). Besides flow cytometric measurement of Mac-1 up-regulated neutrophils as fluorescing events, a fluorescence of the bead population indicates the adherence of activated neutrophils to the biopolymer surface. After establishing this assay, we evaluated it by comparing six different biopolymers. We observed high levels of Mac-1 expression (> 70% of positive control) accompanied by increased adhesiveness (> 60% of neutrophils) for polyurethane (PUR), polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA), and poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) beads. Low Mac-1 expression levels (< 10%) accompanied by a low percentage of adhering neutrophils ( < 10%) were observed for polyethylene (PE), polyisoprene (PI), and silicone (SI) beads.

The increment of interlaminar strength due to the trabeculae in the chitin fiber laminae was approximately 30 times in a local region and 3 times in a whole region larger compared to that of the chitin fiber laminae without trabeculae.

Furthermore, a strong reinforcement mechanism in nature was clarified with a model for the reinforcement mechanism being proposed.","Kyoto Inst Technol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068585, Japan; Natl Aerosp Lab, Tokyo 1828522, Japan","Ni, QQ (reprint author), Kyoto Inst Technol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068585, Japan.",,,,,,,9,11,12,2,4,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"SHINANOMACHI-RENGAKAN BLDG, SHINANOMACHI 35, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 160-0016, JAPAN",1344-7653,,,JSME INT J C-MECH SY,JSME Int.

When immersed in Hank's solution, which has ion concentrations similar to that of human blood, an apatite layer, which accelerates the connection with bone, formed easily on the alkali-treated specimens compared to the non-treated specimens. The number of macrophages, which is known to increase as the inflammation reaction proceeds, is much lower for the alkali-treated specimens than for other samples. The average thickness of the fibrous capsule formed around the implant is much thinner for the alkali-treated specimens than for the others.

The polymers were based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAM). Ethyl methacrylate (EMA) and N-acryloxysuccinimide (NASI) were incorporated into the NiPAM polymer to reduce the lower critical solution temperature and to conjugate to proteins, respectively. To test capacity, of polymers to retain rhBMP-2, rhBMP-2 were labeled with (125)I, formulated with the polymers and were either implanted with a collagen sponge or injected directly into an intramuscular site in rats, The results indicated that implantation with a relatively low polymer concentration (3.9 mg/mL) did not result in significant rhBMP-2 retention, but increasing the polymer concentration (28.7 mg/mL gave a better retention with NiPAM/NASI polymers. In the injectable mode, NiPAM/NASI and NiPAM/EMA gave similar to200-fold better retention after 9 days in vivo. We conclude that synthetic, temperature-sensitive polymers can be engineered to sequester and retain osteoinductive proteins at a Site Of administration.

Rosiak and soon, after formal tests, arrived in the local market (1992). It was a technological breakthrough due to its product characteristics as pain reliever and enhanced healing properties besides its clever production process combining sterilization and crosslinking in a simultaneous operation. IAEA invited professor Rosiak to support the transference of his technology for many laboratories around the world. The laboratories of developing countries, which face all kinds of restrictions, were seduced by the simplicity of the process and low cost of its raw materials. This was the seed of the flourishing activities in hydrogel dressings in Brazil and other developing countries. The technology transfer of the radiation production of hydrogel dressings and other hydrogels to the Brazilian industry is under way. The usual issues associated with radiation processing arise from this experience, i.e. capital costs, misinformation about radiation and lack of expertise on radiation processing. Some other issues concerning local market and social peculiarities also add to the problem. Notwithstanding, many different opportunities arise from those challenges. These technical and commercial issues are roughly: (i) There are plenty of new hydrogels in the market and all say the same. What else radiation processed hydrogels can say? (ii) Regarding to hydrogels and its industrial production as market product, what are the unique characteristics of radiation processing? It was shown that the radiation is a powerful tool for producing hydrogels the same basic formula with improved flexibility, control and purity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ion-exchange membranes play an important role in modern technology, especially in separation and purification of materials. The search for improved membrane composition has considered almost every available polymeric material because of its great practical importance. Grafting of polymers with a mixture of monomers is important since different types of chains containing different functional groups are included. A great deal is focused on the waste treatment of heavy and toxic metals from wastewater because of the severe problems of environmental pollution. Functionalized polymers suitable for metal adsorption with their reactive functional groups such as carboxylic and pyridine groups suitable for waste treatment were prepared by radiation grafting method. More reactive chelating groups were further introduced to the grafted copolymer through its functional groups by chemical treatments with suitable reagents.

In an attempt to determine the effects of a variety of biodegradable materials on cartilage proliferation and extracellular matrix production, poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) with a molecular weight of 5,000, polyglycolic acid (PGA) with a molecular weight of 3,000, and copolymer Of poly(L-lactic acid-glycolic acid) 50:50 (PLGA) with a molecular weight of 5,000, were dissolved in DMSO and added into the medium for 4 weeks in in vitro high-density micromass culture of multiplied human articular chondrocytes (HAC). PLLA with a molecular weight of 270,000 (PLAO3) was used as thin film. Cell proliferation and differentiation in these biomaterials were compared with tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as a control. Alamar blue and alcian blue staining were carried out to determine the chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, respectively. Samples exposed to these biomaterials promoted cell proliferation in the range of 86-105% of the control proliferation, and a slight but significant increase in cell proliferation was noted only in the culture exposed to PLGA. The sample exposed to PGA elicited a significant 3.7-fold higher (p < 0.01) cell differentiation than controls and was significantly higher than that of the samples exposed to PLLA, PLAO3, and PLGA. After 4 weeks of culture, the cell differentiation from most to least was in the following order PGA > PLAO3 > PLGA = PLLA > Cont. = DMSO. Chondrocyte differentiation of the samples exposed to various biomaterials were significantly higher compared with controls. Thus, serially passage chondrocytes are competent for cell growth and quantifiable matrix production, and biodegradable polymers, especially PGA, hold promise as suitable substrates for scaffolding materials for human cartilage tissue engineering.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,48,36,39,1,5,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,DEC,2001.0,7,6,,,,,781,790,,10.1089/107632701753337726,,,,10,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,505FQ,WOS:000172903100009,11749734.0,,,,2019-02-25

However, previous studies showed that protein-PEG adhesion is induced by the application of pressure. Because polymer behavior can vary with the molecular weight, in this study we directly measured the forces between streptavidin and end-grafted monolayers of PEG of different molecular weights and at grafting densities. The results of these measurements show that grafted PEG chains can exist in two different states: a protein-repulsive state and a protein-attractive state. The attractive state can be induced not only by compression but also by increasing the temperature or by altering the polymer molecular weight. Both the critical applied load to induce the protein-attractive form of PEG and the relaxation time back to the protein-resistant state depend on the molecular weight of the grafted chains. The consequences of the observed behavior for the use of grafted PEG chains as protein antifouling coatings of biomaterials are discussed.","Univ Illinois, Dept Chem Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Leckband, DE (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem Engn, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,77,122,123,0,53,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,NOV 27,2001.0,17,24,,,,,7628,7636,,10.1021/la010405c,,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,494VH,WOS:000172306200029,,,,,2019-02-25

The gaseous phase composition has been determined by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, optical imaging and emission spectroscopy. The deposited films were studied by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray diffraction. The adhesion of films to the substrates has been studied by scratch tests. Moreover, after exposing the coatings to a simulating body fluid solution. their bioactivity has been monitored by X-ray diffraction analysis of the hydroxylapatite growth. This procedure has been followed for different time scales up to a maximum of 24 days. The deposition mechanism seems to be related mainly to the mechanical transport of the target material in form of droplets, while the gaseous phase, having a very different composition, plays a marginal role. The overall film retains the target stoichiometry and bioactivity in a large range of experimental conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel infection resistant polyurethane biomaterial using textile dyeing technology. This procedure results in incorporation of the antibiotic into the polymer, resulting in a slow, sustained release of antibiotic from the material over time, without the use of exogenous binder agents. Polycarbonate based urethanes were synthesized that contained either a non-ionic (bdPU) or anionic (cPU) chain extender within the polymer backbone and cast into films. The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) was applied to bdPU and cPU using textile dyeing technology, with Cipro uptake determined by absorbance reduction of the ""dyebath."" These dyed bdPU/cPU samples were then evaluated for prolonged Cipro release and antimicrobial activity by means of spectrophotometric and zone of inhibition assays, respectively. Cipro release and antimicrobial activity by dyed cPU segments that were aggressively washed persisted over 9 days, compared with dyed bdPU and dipped cPU control segments that lasted < 24 hours. Dyed cPU segments, which remained in a static wash solution, maintained antimicrobial activity for 11 days (length of study), whereas controls again lost antimicrobial activity within 24 hours. Thus, application of Cipro to the cPU polymer by means of dyeing technology results in a slow sustained release of antibiotic with persistent bacteriocidal properties over extended periods of time.","Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Text, Kingston, RI USA; Cardiotech Int Inc, Woburn, MA USA","Phaneuf, MD (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, 4 Blackfan Circle,Room 131, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R41 HL62764],,,39,11,13,0,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1058-2916,1538-943X,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,NOV-DEC,2001.0,47,6,,,,,634,640,,10.1097/00002480-200111000-00013,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,493TZ,WOS:000172240700012,11730202.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Random copolymers of trimethylene carbonate and epsilon caprolactone (P(epsilon CL-TMC), 50:50) have been synthesized by ring opening polymerization using rare earth alkoxides as initiator. Their potential use as nerve guide repairs has been assessed through indirect and direct in vitro biocompatibility tests and in vivo soft tissue response to EDI subclass macrophages. In vitro, we exposed monolayers of human skin fibroblasts and an established continuous cell line (Hela) to liquid extracts (either pure or diluted in the culture medium) of epsilon CL-TMC copolymer including positive (phenol) and negative controls. Then, colorimetric assays (Neutral red and MTT) were performed. The extracts of epsilon CL-TMC induced no significant cytotoxic effect. We also exposed in vitro Schwann cells to pieces of P(epsilon CL-TMC) and P(LA-GA) copolymers. We evaluated cell attachment at 1 and 3 h by measuring the activity of the lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-beta -hexosaminidase) and cell proliferation at 1, 3, 6 and 9 days by measuring the cell metabolic activity (MTT assay). Values for attachment slightly decreased between 1 and 3 h but were significantly higher than on agars (negative control). Cells plated on epsilon CL-TMC showed a rate of proliferation comparable with that of normalized controls and higher than on PGA-PLA at day 9. Finally, we evaluated in vivo the soft tissue response after implantation of cylindrical tubes of P(epsilon CL-TMC) and P(LA-GA) copolymers with an immunohistochemistry staining procedure for the newly recruited ED1 macrophages. An image analysis system automatically measured the optical density of labelled positive ED1 cells at 9, 21 and 60 days after implantation. epsilon CL-TMC copolymer showed a mild soft tissue reaction with no adverse chronic inflammatory reaction. These data allowed us to consider this conduit as a potential effective substitute in nerve repair. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Studies on Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts have recently provided evidence that cell spreading is mediated by integrins and RhoA. Our previous studies showed that on Cuprophan, a cellulose membrane (CU) to which vitronectin adhesive protein is poorly adsorbed, Swiss 3T3 cells are rounded and undergo cAMP-dependent aggregation. In contrast, on a polyacrylonitrile membrane (AN69) that favours the adsorption of vitronectin and fibronectin, cells spread out and contain low concentrations of cAMP. We have now examined the parts played by the three components in the cAMP pathway (receptors, G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase itself) in cAMP-dependent cell aggregation on CU. Experiments with intact cells showed no interaction between the CU and receptors, or between the CU and G-proteins. Assays on membrane preparations plus the Mn-ATP substrate, which uncouples G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase, demonstrated that activation of the cAMP pathway by CU depends primarily on the catalytic activity of the adenylyl cyclase. These investigations provide essential data for the development of biomaterials that favour cell functionality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), the cell implicated in biodegradation, also contain hydrolytic activities. Hence, in this study, an activated human MDM cell system was used to assess the biostability of a PCNU, synthesized with C-14-hexane diisocyanate (HDI) and butanediol (BD), previously shown to be susceptible to hydrolysis by cholesterol esterase (CE). Monocytes, isolated from whole blood and cultured for 14 days on polystyrene (PS) to mature MDM, were gently trypsinized and seeded onto C-14-PCNU. Radiolabel release and esterase activity, as measured with p-nitrophenylbutyrate, increased for almost 2 weeks. At 1 week, the increase in radiolabel release and esterase activity were diminished by more than 50% when the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, or the serine esterase/protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride was added to the medium. This strongly suggests that in part, it was MDM esterase activity which contributed to the PU degradation. In an effort to simulate the potential combination of oxidative and hydrolytic activities of inflammatory cells, C-14-PCNU was exposed to HOCl and then CE. Interestingly, the release of radiolabeled products by CE was significantly inhibited by the pre-treatment of PCNU with HOCl The results of this study show that while the co-existing roles of oxidation and hydrolysis in the biodegradation of PCNUs remains to be elucidated, a clear relationship is drawn for PCNU degradation to the hydrolytic degradative activities which increase in MDM during differentiation from monocytes, and during activation in the chronic phase of the inflammatory response.

The strategy employed here utilises carbene generated by illumination of diazirine to achieve covalent bonding of carbohydrates. Here, we describe the synthesis of an aryl diazirine containing a disaccharide (lactose). Surface analysis techniques [X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS)] demonstrate its successful surface immobilisation on polystyrene (PS). Results are compared to those previously obtained with an aryl diazirine containing a monosaccharide (galactose). The biological activity of galactose- or lactose-modified PS samples is studied using rat hepatocytes, Allo A lectin and solid-phase semi-synthesis with alpha -2,6-sialyltransferase. Allo A shows some binding to galactose-modified PS but none to lactose-modified surfaces. Similar results are obtained with rat hepatocytes. In contrast, sialylation of lactose-modified PS is achieved but not with galactose-modified surfaces. The different responses indicate that the biological activity depends not only on the carbohydrate per se but also on the structure and length of the spacer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The source of cells that participate in wound repair directly affects outcome. The extracellular matrix (ECM) and other acellular biomaterials have been used as therapeutic scaffolds for cell attachment and proliferation and as templates for tissue repair. The ECM consists of structural and functional proteins that influence cell attachment, gene expression patterns, and the differentiation of cells. Objective. The objective of this study was to determine if the composition of acellular matrix scaffolds affects the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cellular elements that populate the scaffolds in vivo. Methods. Scaffolds composed of porcine tissue ECM, purified Type I collagen, poly(L)lactic coglycolic acid (PLGA), or a mixture of porcine ECM and PLGA were implanted into subcutaneous pouches on the dorsum of mice. The origin of cells that populated the matrices was determined by first performing bone marrow transplantation to convert the marrow of glucose phosphate isomerase 1b (Gpi-1(b)) mice to cells expressing glucose phosphate isomerase 1a (Gpi-1(a)). Results. A significant increase in Gpi-1(a) expressing cells was present in sites implanted with the porcine ECM compared to sites implanted with either Type I collagen or PLGA. Use of recipient mice transplanted with marrow cells that expressed beta -galactosidase confirmed that the majority of cells that populated and remodeled the naturally occurring porcine ECM were marrow derived. Addition of porcine ECM to the PLGA scaffold caused a significant increase in the number of marrow-derived cells that became part of the remodeled implant site. Conclusion. The composition of bioscaffolds affects the cellular recruitment pattern during tissue repair. ECM scaffolds facilitate the recruitment of marrow-derived cells into sites of remodeling.

Maximum load, maximum strength (p <0.0005) and elastic modulus (p <0.005) decreased by about 28% in the OVX group in comparison with the other groups. In the OVX group, vertebral cancellous bone volume, trabecular thickness and trabecular number decreased by about 32% (p <0.0005), 15% (p=0.001) and 20% (p=0.019), respectively. An overall decrease in the bone turnover rate of the OVX group was registered in terms of bone formation rate (p=0.007) and activation frequency (p <0.0005). The variations observed in cancellous bone mechanics and histomorphometry would suggest the development of an osteopenic state in ewe vertebrae at 24 months. Such findings may be useful for future experimental investigations on biomaterials and prosthetic devices to be implanted in the osteopenic spine.","Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Giavaresi, G (reprint author), Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, IOR, Serv Chirurgia Sperimentale, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/J-5298-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/0000-0001-7494-9970; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,51,25,26,0,2,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The effects of different concentrations of corrosion products on the growth of rat aortic smooth muscle cells were conducted with the [H-3]thymidine uptake test and cell cycle sorter. Both the supernatant and precipitates of corrosion products were toxic to the primary culture of smooth muscle cells. The growth inhibition was correlated well with the increased nickel ions in the corrosion products when nickel concentration was above 11.7 ppm. The corrosion products also changed cell morphology and induced cell necrosis. The cell growth inhibition occurred at the G0/G1 to S transition phase. Similar to our recent study of nitinol stent wire, the present investigation also demonstrated the cytotoxicity of corrosion products of 316 L stainless steel stent wire on smooth muscle cells, which might affect the poststenting vascular response.

Their high water content and tissue-like elasticity are similar to the native extracellular matrix of many tissues. In this work, we investigated the potential of a modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel as a biomaterial for tissue engineering applications. First, the ability of NIH3T3 fibroblast cells to attach to PVA hydro-els was evaluated. Because of PVA's extremely hydrophilic nature, important cell adhesion proteins do not adsorb to PVA hydrogels, and consequently, cells are unable to adhere to the hydrogel. By covalently attaching the important cell adhesion protein fibronectin onto the PVA hydrogel surface, the rate of fibroblast attachment and proliferation was dramatically improved, and promoted two-dimensional cell migration. These studies illustrate that a fibronectin-modified PVA hydrogel is a potential biomaterial for tissue engineering applications.

Change in this function when contacting fibroblasts with various polymer microspheres was estimated using the metabolic cooperation assay system. When the cells were in contact with the microspheres after their adhesion onto a substrate, the function did not alter. However, when they were in contact with precoated microspheres on test dishes, the function was inhibited as the quantity of microspheres increased. Moreover, the inhibition level increased as the diameters of polyethylene and polystyrene microspheres decreased. However, no inhibition was observed if precoated microspheres were composed from poly(L-lactic acid). These findings suggest that the size and the material of microspheres, and how cells recognize the microspheres, are factors affecting cell function of gap junctional intercellular communication. Therefore, estimating this function may provide valuable information about the biocompatibility of many kinds of materials even in the form of particles.

Hydrogel did not allow the majority of cells to adhere well ut maintained their viability. Hydrogel leachouts were nontoxic to the cells, as confirmed by tetrazolium reduction (MTT) and Neutral red uptake assays. Exposure to leachouts also did not alter their functional tv as seen from normal expression of von Willebrand factor. -H-3-thymidine incorporation revealed that hydrogel leachouts did not induce endothelial cell proliferation.

The morbidity of failed fracture healing is significant and may require bone grafting. Donor site morbidity and finite amounts of autogenous bone are major drawbacks of autogenous bone grafting. Similarly, the use of allografts and xenografts may be associated with an increased risk of rejection, infection, and nonunion. To circumvent the limitations of bone grafting, research efforts have focused on formulating a suitable bone substitute. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of type I collagen implants in repairing critical sized mandibular defects in rats. Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300g) were divided equally into control and experimental groups. Full thickness, round, four millimeter in diameter defects were created in the ramus of the right mandible of all rats using an electrical burr at low speed. The defects were irrigated of all bone chips, and either filled with a precisely fitted disk of allogenic collagen type I gel (experimental animals) or left empty (control animals). Animals were killed 6 weeks after surgery and healing of the bone defects was assessed in a blinded fashion using radiologic and histologic analysis. Radiologic analysis of the control group revealed a clear circular right mandibular defect in all animals, whereas the collagen disk implant group revealed an indistinct to nonexistent right mandibular defect in all animals. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant difference between these groups (*P = 0.01). Similarly, gross analysis of control mandibles revealed a 4mm round, soft-tissue filled defect, while implanted defects demonstrated gross bone spanning the defect. Finally, histologic analysis of all control mandibles revealed clearly demarcated bony edges at the defect border with connective tissue spanning the defect. In contrast, histological analysis of all implanted mandibles revealed indistinct bony edges at the defect border with a thin layer of osteoblasts and viable bone spanning the defects. We have demonstrated the ability of type I collagen to promote healing of a membranous bony defect that would not otherwise heal at 6 weeks. The suitability of type I collagen as a carrier matrix provides ample opportunity for tissue-engineered approaches to further facilitate bony defect healing. Promoting bone formation through tissue engineering matrices offers great promise for skeletal healing and reconstruction.","Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Colagenesis Inc, Beverly, MA USA; New York Eye & Ear Infirm, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10003 USA; NYU, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10016 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Surg, Farmington, CT USA","Longaker, MT (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 269 Campus Dr,CCSR Room 1225-S, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Longaker@stanford.edu,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [R01 DE13028],,,35,30,38,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1049-2275,1536-3732,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

At constant protein concentration, a decrease of salt concentration from 0.8 to 0.085 M caused a transition of the crystal growth mechanism from two-dimensional nucleation to dislocation growth. At different, fixed concentrations of salt, the protein concentration, which does not induce multiple crystal nucleation, was increased from 8 to 60 mg/ml with corresponding increases in the tangential velocity of growth steps from 5 to 17.5 nm/s. Results from these experiments suggest that a highly concentrated protein solution, as might be found in a protein rich phase, may not induce crystal nucleation, but can promote crystal growth if screw dislocations are present in the crystal.

Raising the adhesion ligand density increased osteoblast proliferation, and a minimum ligand density (1.5-15 femtomoles/cm(2)) was needed to elicit this effect.

Using atomic force microscopy, we have obtained direct three-dimensional visual evidence of the size and shape of native protein-free mineralites isolated from mature bovine bone. Approximately 98% of the mineralites are less than 2 nm thick displaying a plate-like habit. Distributions of both thickness and width show single peaks. The distribution of lengths may be multimodal with distinct peaks separated by similar to6 nm. Application of our results is expected to be of use in the design of novel orthopaedic biomaterials.

The engineering of bioactive electrode coatings has been investigated for its potential to promote in-growth of neural tissue and reduce sheer at the electrode-host interface. Preliminary results indicate that hydrogel coatings with either collagen I or polylysine-laminin-1 can promote cortical nerve cell attachment and differentiation on silicon substrates. Additionally, slow-release microtubules can also be implanted in these gels to release agents that either provide trophic support to neurons or prevent inflammation locally. When silicon discs are coated with collagen type I, the coating remains stable for 55 days.

Near perfect adaptation of the cement to the tissue surfaces in a defect, and a gradual resorption followed by new bone formation are some of the other distinctive advantages of this biomaterial. In 1996 a CPC, consisting of tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) for repairing cranial defects in humans, thus becoming the first material of its kind available for clinical use.

The present study showed that culture of marrow mesenchymal cells with porous artificial bone material in an osteogenic culture medium containing dexamethasone could produce new bone tissue on the artificial material. This bio-artificial bone graft substitute could effectively regenerate bone tissue when it was implanted in vivo. Porous artificial bone material treated with a small amount of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and perfused with marrow mesenchymal cells also markedly stimulated bone regeneration by the interaction between the cells and BMP. Similarly, when an artificial dermis made of collagen sponge was perfused with marrow mesenchymal cells and used to cover a skin defect, the regeneration of blood vessels was stimulated.

As the basis for modem internal fixation of fractures, these principles are presently supported by the majority of orthopedic surgeons. However, with recent advances in bioengineering and biomaterials, it has become necessary to reconsider these principles. We focused our attention on cerclage fixation, which is not considered so important by the AO group, and developed two new cerclage materials. One is a nylon strap that is in wide industrial use. In the field of orthopedics, Partridge first employed the nylon strap for internal fixation and demonstrated its efficacy in 1976. However, its use was thereafter discontinued because of various complications. We developed a nylon strap for temporary fracture fixation and demonstrated its efficacy in clinical studies. We also developed a bioabsorbable thread for the tight tying of bones. Bone fixation with a thread is sometimes used clinically, but adequate fixation often cannot be obtained because of loosening of the knot. Therefore, we prepared a blended thread by mixing poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and epsilon -polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber, so that it could be fixed tightly by melting. The fatigue strength of this thread was higher than that of a stainless-steel wire with the same cross-sectional area. We are aiming to establish more effective and convenient methods of treatment by developing new bone fixation materials and examining their efficacy. In the future treatment of fractures, it will be important to develop new instruments and bone fixation materials for the purpose of standardizing the procedures used by surgeons.

A new method of preparing porous scaffolds composed of synthetic biodegradable polymers was developed by combining porogen leaching and freeze-drying techniques using preprepared ice particulates as the porogen material. The pore structures of the polymer sponges could be manipulated by controlling processing variables such as the sized and weight fraction of the ice particulates and the polymer concentration. The synthetic polymer sponges were further hybridized with collagen microsponges to prepare biodegradable hybrid porous sponges of synthetic polymer and collagen. The collagen microsponges were formed in the pores of synthetic polymer sponges. The hybrid sponges exhibited the advantages of both the synthetic polymers and collagen. Hybrid sponges of synthetic polymer, collagen, and inorganic hydroxyapatite were developed by depositing hydroxyapatite particulates on the surfaces of the collagen microsponges in the synthetic polymer-collagen sponges. The use of synthetic polymer sponge as a mechanical skeleton facilitated the formation of these hybrid sponges into desired shapes, contributed good mechanical strength and handling, while the collagen and hydroxyapatite facilitated cell seeding and promoted cell interaction.

The use of synthetic materials is limited to grafts larger than 5-6mm, because of the frequency of occlusion observed with small-diameter prosthetics. An alternative would be a hybrid or tissue-engineered graft with the surface coated with a monolayer of the patient's own cells. Currently, to be effective, high-density seeding regimens have to be undertaken. This is because endothelial cells (ECs) are washed off the graft lumen once exposed to physiological blood flow. EC attachment has been shown to be significantly improved by pre-coating with substances known to attach ECs selectively. The review examines the various types of coating and bonding technology used to date to enhance endothelial cell attachment onto the surface of prosthetic vascular bypass grafts.","UCL & Royal Free Hosp, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Surg, Tissue Engn Ctr, London, England","Seifalian, AM (reprint author), UCL & Royal Free Hosp, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Surg, Tissue Engn Ctr, London, England.",a.seifalian@rfc.ucl.ac.uk,"Seifalian, Alexander/I-6028-2013","Seifalian, Alexander/0000-0002-1180-3322",,,,110,63,63,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0140-0118,1741-0444,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

Foldable intraocular lenses (IOL) have become increasingly preferred choice for IOL implantation after cataract removal. However, both foldable as well as rigid IOLs are not yet complication-free and may need explantation. Material and methods. A total of 2663 explanted posterior chamber IOLs (PCIOLs) were accessioned at the Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices between January 1988 and September 2000. The lenses were examinated grossly using a Leitz/Wild M-8-Zoom stereo microscope. The clinical reasons for explantation were documented for foldable as well as for rigid lenses. Results. Of a total of 2663 explanted POOLS, 586 were foldable lenses and 2077 were rigid PMMA lenses The most frequent reason for explantation of all 2663 IOLs studied was decentration/dislocation. Optic and haptic damage and posterior capsule rupture were significantly more often a reason for explantation in several foldable designs compared to rigid PCIOLs. Whereas rigid designs lead more often to corneal decompensation. The percentage of explanted IOLs because of inflammatory reactions decreased significantly from 1994 to 2000. Conclusions. The complication profiles of rigid and foldable IOLs revealed some apparent differences due to the nature of the IOL biomaterials and designs. IOL optic/haptic damage was a common complication for foldable IOLs,whereas it was only discovered in single digits for rigid PMMA IOLs. The possible explanation for this is,that the soft and flexible biomaterials,from which all the foldable IOLs were manufactured, are easier to be damaged during folding, unfolding and insertion procedure. In our opinion this relative disadvantage of foldable IOLs is by far outweighed by the numerous advantages of the small incision cataract surgery. The decreasing inflammatory reactions can be explained by advances in surgical techniques, especially the secure in-the-bag fixation of IOLs.","Med Univ S Carolina, Storm Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Res Ocular Therapeut & Biodevices, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; Univ Homburg, Augenklin, Poliklin, D-6650 Homburg, Germany; Univ Heidelberg, Augenklin, Poliklin, Heidelberg, Germany","Apple, DJ (reprint author), Med Univ S Carolina, Storm Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Res Ocular Therapeut & Biodevices, 167 Ashley Ave,POB 250676, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.",,,,,,,22,10,10,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0941-293X,,,OPHTHALMOLOGE,Ophthalmologe,NOV,2001.0,98,11,,,,,1029,1035,,10.1007/s003470170021,,,,7,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,496VP,WOS:000172418000004,11729733.0,,,,2019-02-25

That especially concerns the ultrafine network architecture, high hydrophilicity, and mouldability during formation. BActerial SYnthesized Cellulose (BASYC((R))) was designed tubularly directly during the cultivation with the aim to develop biomaterials for medical application. These formed products were applicated as covers in experimental micronerve surgery and - most important - as artificial blood vessel interpositions with inner diameter of about 1 mm. High mechanical strength in wet state, enormous water retention values, low roughness of the inner surface, and a complete 'vitalization' of BASYC((R)) - microvessel-interpositions in rat experiments demonstrate the high potential of BASYC((R)) as an artificial blood vessel in microsurgery.

A special emphasis is placed on the controlled modification reactions to prepare chitin derivatives with well-defined structures and thereby to construct sophisticated molecular architecture having various advanced functions. The reactions discussed here include hydrolysis of main chain, deacetylation, acylation, N-phthaloylation of chitosan, tosylation, alkylation, Schiff base formation, reductive alkylation, O-carboxymethylation, N-carboxyalkylation, silylation, and graft copolymerization. For conducting modification reactions in a facile and controlled manner, some soluble chitin derivatives are convenient. Of soluble precursors reported, N-phthaloyl-chitosan has proved particularly useful and made possible series of regioselective and quantitative substitutions thus far difficult. One of the important achievements based on this organosoluble precursor is the synthesis of nonnatural branched polysaccharides that have sugar branches at a specific site of the linear chitin or chitosan backbone.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed on these two materials for an application to plastic transport pallets. Transport pallets reinforced with China reed fibre prove to be ecologically advantageous if they have a minimal lifetime of 3 years compared with the 5-year lifetime of the conventional pallet. The energy consumption and other environmental impacts are strongly reduced by the use of raw renewable fibres, due to three important factors: (a) the substitution of glass fibre production by the natural fibre production; (b) the indirect reduction in the use of polypropylene linked to the higher proportion of China reed fibre used and (c) the reduced pallet weight, which reduces fuel consumption during transport. Considering the whole life cycle, the polypropylene production process and the transport cause the strongest environmental impacts during the use phase of the life cycle. Since thermoplastic composites are hardly biodegradable, incineration has to be preferred to discharge on landfills at the end of its useful life cycle. The potential advantages of the renewable fibres will be effective only if a purer fibre extraction is obtained to ensure an optimal material stiffness, a topic for further research. China reed biofibres are finally compared with other usages of biomass, biomaterials, in general, can enable a three to ten times more efficient valorisation of biomass than mere heat production or biofuels for transport.

The study was undertaken to evaluate whether scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of removed catheters can be useful in early diagnosis of plastic infection by Candida, providing information useful for initiation of an eventual therapy. The evolution of biofilms in 28 catheters (umbilical or central) implanted in 24 newborns for prematurity was studied by SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In 4 of 24 patients, SEM examination revealed the presence of Candida in form of yeast or hyphae. In one of these patients, TEM confirmed the presence of organisms. In each case, hemoculture and culture of the catheter itself confirmed the diagnosis. The study demonstrates that SEM can identify fungi in the biomaterials covering the catheter surface in a few hours, allowing an early diagnosis of plastic infection.","Univ Verona, Inst Anat & Histol, Fac Med, Dept Morphol & Biomed Sci,Sect Anat & Histol, I-37134 Verona, Italy; Univ Verona, Sect Pediat, Dept Maternal Fetal Invest & Genet, I-37134 Verona, Italy","Sbarbati, A (reprint author), Univ Verona, Inst Anat & Histol, Fac Med, Dept Morphol & Biomed Sci,Sect Anat & Histol, Strada Grazie 8, I-37134 Verona, Italy.",,,"Fanos, Vassilios/0000-0003-2617-2890",,,,10,8,8,0,1,FAMS INC,MAHWAH,"BOX 832, MAHWAH, NJ 07430-0832 USA",0161-0457,,,SCANNING,Scanning,NOV-DEC,2001.0,23,6,,,,,376,378,,,,,,3,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,499WT,WOS:000172594100004,11770933.0,,,,2019-02-25

MAPLE involves dissolving or suspending the biomaterial in a volatile solvent, freezing the mixture to create a solid target, and using a low fluence pulsed laser to evaporate the target for deposition of the solute inside a vacuum system. Using simple shadow masks, i.e. lines, dots and arrays, pattern features with length scales as small as 20 mum can be deposited using multiple materials on different types of substrates. MDW uses pulsed laser to directly transfer material from a ribbon to a substrate. Patterns with a spatial resolution of similar to 10 mum can be written directly. Biomaterials ranging from polyethylene glycol to eukaryotic cells, i.e. Chinese hamster ovaries, were deposited with no measurable damage to their structures or genotype. Deposits of immobilized horseradish peroxidase, an enzyme, in the form of a polymer composite with a protective coating, i.e. polyurethane, retained their enzymatic functions. A dopamine electrochemical sensor was fabricated by MDW using a natural tissues/graphite composite. These examples and the unique features of MAPLE and MDW for biosensor fabrication have been discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Results showed that they are not susceptible to galvanic corrosion when Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V are simultaneously used in an assembled part in the pure corrosion condition, but the fretting surfaces will become more vulnerable to galvanic corrosion. Acceleration of anodic dissolution of the fretted area is dominated by the ""large cathode effect"". Ti-6Al-4V acts as a cathode with respect to the non-contact area of the Co-Cr-Mo alloy. For fretting pairs composed of the same alloy, galvanic corrosion can also take place on the non-contact area which will act as the ""large-area"" cathode. The fretting corrosion mechanism of two biomaterials has been proposed based upon observations of the topography of the fretted scars as well as other corrosion information.

Skin trauma involves damage to the epidermal, dermal and/or subdermal tissues. Epithelial, dermal and full-thickness replacements are considered. Cartilage research is mainly focused on replacing hyaline cartilage. Researchers investigate both nondegradable polymers, which must provide mechanical stability, and degradable polymers, which must support cartilage regeneration. Natural healing in large bone defects often fails. Materials for bone reconstruction must be biocompatible, offer mechanical properties similar to those of bone and support tissue regeneration. The area of vascular grafts draws attention as improvements to the patency of existing materials are needed. Studies to improve current vascular graft polymers as well as develop new polymers are reviewed below. The design and testing of materials for nerve regeneration, to repair damage caused by illness or accident, is an active area of research. Directional nerve guidance via tubulation is discussed, as are matrix materials to enhance axonal extension. Finally, liver transplantation remains one of the only options for chronic liver disease and the demand for liver transplants far exceeds the number of available organs. The complexity of parameters involved in liver regeneration is presented here. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14), the elastic constant s(55) and the dielectric permittivity 8(11), were measured for the anionic collagen and collagen-HA films. The thermal analysis shows that the denaturation endotherm is at 59.47 degreesC for the collagen sample. The collagen-HA composite film shows two transitions, at 48.9 and 80.65 degreesC. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the collagen film shows a broad band characteristic of an amorphous material. The main peaks associated to the crystalline HA is present in the sample of collagen-HA. In the collagen-HA composite, one can also notice the presence of other peaks with low intensities which is an indication of the formation of other crystalline phases of apatite. The scanning electron photomicrograph of anionic collagen membranes shows very thin bundles of collagen. The scanning electron photomicrography of collagen-HA film also show deposits of hydroxyapatite on the collagen fibers forming larger bundles and suggesting that a collagenous structure of reconstituted collagen fibers could act as nucleators for the formation of apatite crystal similar to those of bone. The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14) was measured for the anionic collagen, with a value of 0.062 pC N-1, which is in good agreement compared with values reported in the literature obtained with other techniques. For the collagen-HA composite membranes, a slight decrease of the value of the piezoelectricity (0.041 pC N-1) was observed.

MAPS combines homogeneous surface derivatization of a polymer to introduce a reactive functional group followed by reactive microcontact printing (mu CP) of a biological ligand of interest, linked to an appropriate reactive group. We demonstrate here that polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) films can be successfully modified to introduce COOH groups on their surfaces, which can be subsequently patterned by reactive mu CP of amine-terminated biotin after derivatization. of the COOH groups with pentafluorophenol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) confirmed the chemistry of MAPS at each stage of the derivatization of the polymer surfaces and reactive mu CP of biotin. Micropatterned biotin surfaces fabricated by MAPS were patterned with streptavidin by exploiting molecular recognition between biotin and streptavidin. The formation of streptavidin patterns was examined by fluorescence microscopy of Alexa488-labeled streptavidin and by TOF-SIMS imaging of N-15-labeled recombinant streptavidin, bound to biotin patterns. The contrast in the streptavidin micropatterns was optimized by examining the effect of blocking agents and streptavidin incubation time.

A biosensor basically consists of a transducer in conjunction with a biologically active molecule that converts a biochemical signal into a quantifiable electric response. The specificity of the biosensor depends on the selection of the biomaterial. Enzymes, antibodies, DNA, receptors, organelles, microorganisms as well as animal and plant cells or tissues have been used as biologic sensing materials. Advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and immunochemistry are expected to lead to a rapid expansion in the range of biologic recognition elements to be used in the field of biosensors. Biomaterials that are stable and function even in highly acidic, alkaline, hydrophobic, or oxidizing environments as well as stable to high temperature and immune to toxic substrates in the processing stream will play an important role. Techniques for immobilization of the biomaterials have played a significant role in the biosensor field. Immobilization not only brings about the intimate contact of the biologic catalysts with the transducer, but also helps in the stabilization of the biologic system, thus enhancing its operational and storage stability. A number of techniques have been developed in our laboratory for the immobilization of enzymes, multienzyme systems, cells, and enzyme-cell conjugates. Some of these aspects that are of significance in biosensor applications have been highlighted.","Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Nucl Agr & Biotechnol Div, Trombay 400085, Mumbai, India","D'Souza, SF (reprint author), Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Nucl Agr & Biotechnol Div, Trombay 400085, Mumbai, India.",,,,,,,102,61,61,0,29,HUMANA PRESS INC,TOTOWA,"999 RIVERVIEW DRIVE SUITE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512 USA",0273-2289,,,APPL BIOCHEM BIOTECH,Appl.

Bone tissue engineering holds great promise in providing strategies that will result in complete regeneration of bone and restoration of its function. Currently, such strategies include the transplantation of highly porous scaffolds seeded with cells. Prior to transplantation the seeded cells are cultured in vitro in order for the cells to proliferate, differentiate and generate extracellular matrix. Factors that can affect cellular function include the cell-biomaterial interaction, as well as the biochemical and the mechanical environment. To optimize culture conditions, good understanding of these parameters is necessary. The new developments in bone biology, bone cell mechanotransduction, and cell-surface interactions are reviewed here to demonstrate that bone mechanotransduction is strongly influenced by the biomaterial properties.

With regard to (1) whether the induced bone would disappear with time due to the absence of mechanical stresses and (2) whether this heterotopically formed bone would give rise to uncontrolled growth, a long-time investigation of porous hydroxyapatite ceramic (HA), porous biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic (TCP/HA, BCP), porous alpha -tricalcium phosphate ceramic (alpha -TCP) and porous beta -tricalcium phosphate ceramic (beta -TCP) was performed in dorsal muscles of dog, for 2.5 years. Histological observation, backscattered scanning electron microscopy observation and histomorphometric analysis were made on thin un-decalcified sections of retrieved samples. Normal compact bone with bone marrow was found in all HA implants (n = 4) and in all BCP implants (n = 4), 48 +/- 4% pore area was filled with bone in HA implants and 41 +/- 2% in BCP implants. Bone-like tissue, which was a mineralised bone matrix with osteocytes but lacked osteoblasts and bone marrow, was found in all beta -TCP implants (n = 4) and in one of the four alpha -TCP implants. Both normal bone and bone-like tissues were confined inside the pores of the implants. The results show that calcium phosphate ceramics are osteoinductive in muscles of dogs, Although the quality and quantity varied among different ceramics, the induced bone in both HA and BCP ceramics did neither disappear nor grow uncontrollably during the period as long as 2.5 years.

Fully polymerized polyurethanes (a polyurea-polyurethane and a polycarbonate polyurethane) were modified (post-polymerization) with bromoalkylation of the hard segments followed by attachment of a bisphosphonate group at the bromine site. These bisphosphonate-polyurethanes resisted calcification in rat 60 day subdermal implants compared to nonmodified control polyurethane implants, that calcify. Bisphosphonates-modified polyurethanes were also studied in circulatory implants using a pulmonary valve cusp replacement model in sheep. Polyurethane cusps modified with bisphosphonate did not calcify in 90 day implants, compared to control polyurethane cusps implants, that demonstrated nodular surface oriented calcific deposits. It is concluded that bisphosphonate modified polyurethanes resist calcification both in subdermal implants and in the circulation. This novel biomaterial approach offers great promise for long-term blood stream implantation with calcification resistance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The anticoagulant potential of these derivatives was estimated with common clotting assays, such as thrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. It was found that a pronounced anticoagulant activity of cellulose derivatives could be achieved if the degree of substitution (DS) with sulfate was above 1.0. The anticoagulant activity was maximal at a DS of about 1.5 and then decreased again. Further, it was detected that particularly sulfation in C2-position resulted in a pronounced anticoagulant activity of cellulose derivatives. Development and application of assays specific for thrombin and factor Xa indicated that the anticoagulant potential of these cellulose derivatives was mainly due to anti-thrombin activity. The comparison of cellulose sulfates and cellulose derivatized with phosphate and quaternary ammonium groups demonstrated that the negative charge and type of the substituent is an important prerequisite for the anticoagulant activity of cellulose derivatives. Indeed, derivatization with sulfate produced superior activity in comparison with phosphate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The tissue was tested biaxially using a hydraulic simulator that subjected it to increasing stress until rupture. One hundred eighty trials were performed, 36 with unsutured pericardium and four series of 36 trials each with pericardium sutured with silk, Prolene, nylon or Gore-Tex. The samples were tested in pairs from three different pericardial regions. One sample from each pair (the predictive specimen) was assessed according to morphological and mechanical criteria, while the other (the predicted or selectable specimen) was subjected only to morphological analysis. The findings show that ostrich pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde according to standard methods has an excellent resistance to rupture in biaxial testing, withstanding stresses of up to 100 M Pa, and never lower than 30 M Pa. Its resistance to rupture is lowered by suturing, a loss that is less pronounced when silk sutures are used. The results with Gore-Tex are very homogeneous and the elastic behavior of the pericardium/suture unit appears to be similar to that of unsutured tissue, suggesting that the interaction between the two biomaterials is minor. Similar results were observed in the series sutured with Prolene and nylon. The use of paired samples makes it possible to closely estimate the mechanical behavior of the tissue in a given zone by determining that of its mate. The statistical study shows that this estimation is not conditioned by the suture employed, thus validating this approach and providing more precise criteria for tissue selection.

The chemical treatments used to stabilize the tissue employed are considered to play a fundamental role in the development of these two phenomena, although the problem is multifactorial and the underlying causes are yet to be fully identified. Currently, there is an ongoing search for chemical treatments capable of reducing or eliminating the process of calcification while preserving the mechanoelastic characteristics of the tissue. One of the approaches to this effort is the elimination of the phospholipid component from the biological tissue employed in prosthesis construction. There is evidence that this component may be responsible for the precipitation of calcium salts. The present study compares two delipidating chemical treatments involving chloroform/methanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with the use of glutaraldehyde (GA) alone. For this purpose, porcine pericardial tissue was subjected to tensile strength testing employing a hydraulic simulator. A total of 234 samples were studied 90 treated with GA, 72 treated with chloroform/methanol and 72 treated with SDS. The mean breaking strength was significantly higher in the samples treated with GA (between 43.29 and 63.01 MPa) when compared with those of tissue treated with chloroform/methanol (29.92-42.30MPa) or with SDS (13.49-19.06MPa). In a second phase of the study, selection criteria based on morphological and mechanical factors were applied to the pericardial membranes employing a system of paired samples. The mathematical analysis of the findings in one fragment will aid in determining the mechanical behavior of its adjacent twin sample. In conclusion, the anticalcification chemical treatments tested in the experimental model conferred a lesser mechanical resistance than that obtained with GA. On the other hand, the utilization of paired samples was found to be useful in the prediction of the mechanical behavior of porcine pericardial tissue. Nevertheless, in order for our method of selection to be considered the most adequate approach, it will be necessary to validate these findings in dynamic studies involving a real, functional model.

Therefore, thrombotic occlusion is the predominant cause for the failure of small diameter vascular grafts made out of Dacron or Teflon. To reduce surface thrombogenicity of material surfaces used for vascular implants, in vitro seeding of endothelial cells using adhesive protein matrix is under evaluation in various laboratories. Evidences suggest that fibrin matrix is a suitable matrix for endothelial cell (EC) adhesion to the currently available vascular graft materials; however, poor proliferation of attached cells seems to be a major limitation. During this study we have also found that fibrin is a better matrix compared to gelatin to support cell attachment and spreading. However, the poor proliferation of initially attached human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) necessitated modification of the matrix composition to get a monolayer within a limited period. Since fibrin can form a network of protein bundles, an effort is made to incorporate growth factors within the matrix. Endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) isolated from bovine hypothalamus is immobilized on the surface with fibrin glue (FG) to promote proliferation of HUVEC. The results demonstrate that proteins with similar molecular weights as growth factors (GF) are retained within the matrix and released into the culture medium for 96 h, in quantities that would be sufficient to promote cell proliferation. When cells were seeded on the matrix composed with components of FG and ECGF, the HUVEC proliferated at a significantly higher rate compared to the cells on surfaces coated with gelatin or fibrin. The EC thus grown on the composite (FG + ECGF) resisted the shear stress as compared to the cells grown on gelatin. The HUVEC monolayer grown on the composite seems thromboresistant as adhesion and activation of platelets are negligible after platelet rich plasma is incubated with the monolayer for about 1 h with agitation. Therefore, the composite of fibrin and ECGF can be a suitable matrix for further evaluation of patients' autologous endothelial cell attachment and proliferation for clinical application.

A therapeutic agent in the form of a drug can be added to the biomaterial by encapsulation into microparticles to protect the active agent, control its release and preserve the material rheological properties. Poly(epsilon -caprolactone) was used in this study because of its biocompatibility and resorbability, as tested in orthopaedic implants and surgical sutures. Particles (80-200 mum) were manufactured by a solvent evaporation-extraction process (1 g of polymer, 11-15 ml methylene chloride, with a stirring speed of 400-600 rpm) and introduced into the IBS in a 5-50% (V/V) range. Injectability was evaluated by texture analysis. With less than 45% of particles, the material had rheological properties similar to those of the reference IBS, whereas injectability decreased markedly with more than 45% of particles.

However, the precise effects of glass-reinforced HA on the growth and functions of bone cells are still unclear. The present study has therefore examined the response of human osteoblast-like cells to HA and HA reinforced with two different proportions of glass, namely 2.5% and 5%. All materials enabled the cells to attach and proliferate during 7 days in culture and, although the growth was less than on control plastic surfaces, there was no deleterious effect of the 5% glass composite compared with HA alone. Flow cytometry analysis showed that there was no effect on cell size and granularity, but there were marked and highly selective changes in the expression of certain connective tissue proteins. Thus, while bone sialoprotein and osteonectin were down-regulated on HA alone, the expression of these antigens was relatively enhanced on the composite materials, and collagen type I was also up-regulated on the glass-reinforced HA. Thus, modulation of the glass composition of HA materials could be used to produce not only improved mechanical strength, but also enhanced biocompatibility. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The review focuses on the use of small organic probes and fluorescent biomolecules that provide information on pore-solvent composition and polarity, internal solvent and dopant dynamics, environmental heterogeneity and phase segregation, and surface chemistry, as determined by molecule-matrix interactions. Emphasis is placed on advanced fluorescence methods that can provide unique information on sol-gel-derived composite materials. The discussion begins with a description of the different fluorescent probes that have been used to study sol-gel materials. The application of fluorescence methods to examine Class I and Class II hybrid materials is then described, highlighting the specific information available from different probes and the methods used to obtain information on the structure and dynamics of such materials. This section highlights the overall effects of dispersed and bound organic dopants on the polarity, dynamics, heterogeneity, and surface chemistry of nanocomposites. Finally, fluorescence studies on emerging materials, including templated nanocomposites and biomaterials, are described, and the overall utility of fluorescence spectroscopy for probing of such materials is discussed.","McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada","Brennan, JD (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada.",,,,,,,110,93,94,1,30,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Neocartilage disks as much as 1.5 mm thick were produced, which were characterized by synthesis of the normal articular cartilage collagens and proteoglycans. In contrast to growth in serum-containing media, chondrocytes from juveniles maintained in static culture under defined serum-free conditions deposited an extracellular matrix that accumulated in the form of tissue disks. Electron microscopic evaluation of neocartilage disks revealed collagenous matrices characteristic of articular cartilage from human infants. The neocartilage did not show terminal chondrocyte differentiation as shown by the absence of Type X collagen production and lack of cellular hypertrophy. Although chondrocytes from preadolescent donor cartilage recapitulated embryonic development in the absence of exogenous factors, chondrocytes from articular cartilage from adults failed to produce neocartilage when grown under identical conditions. This is the first demonstration that autocrine morphogens are sufficient to guide production of hyaline cartilage in vitro. In addition to providing a unique model system to compare the healing response of mature and immature articular chondrocytes, this technology may be of clinical importance in the development of new biomaterials for repair of articular cartilage defects.","Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, Div Renal, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, Dept Cell Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Adkisson, HD (reprint author), Isto Technol Inc, 1139 Olivette Execut Pkwy St, St Louis, MO 63132 USA.",,"Davis, Elaine/F-3449-2012",,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR39561, AR41677]",,,62,41,41,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Tissue engineering is a relatively new but rapidly growing field that has sought to use combinations of implanted cells, biomaterials, and biologically active molecules to repair or regenerate injured or diseased tissues. Despite many advances, tissue engineers have faced significant challenges in repairing or replacing tissues that serve a predominantly biomechanical function, such as articular cartilage. An evolving discipline termed functional tissue engineering seeks to address these challenges by emphasizing and evaluating the role of biomechanical factors in the intrinsic and engineered repair of tissues and organs. In the current study, the authors describe some of the fundamental issues involving the interaction of biomechanical stresses in vivo and in vitro with native and repair articular cartilage and with other biomechanically functional tissues. A more thorough and formal investigation of these issues may provide a basis for developing rational design principles for tissue engineered replacement or repair of load-bearing structures in the body.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Orthopaed Res Labs, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Aerosp Engn & Engn Mech, Noyes Giannestras Biomech Labs, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; Univ Michigan, Orthopaed Res Labs, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Guilak, F (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Orthopaed Res Labs, Dept Surg, Box 3093,375 MSRB, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR20557, AR46574, AR43876]; NIA NIH HHS [AG15768]; NIDCR NIH HHS [DE13014]",,,106,121,126,2,18,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-921X,1528-1132,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Numerous methods have been devised to augment its natural heating response, but these methods generally lead to filling of the defect with fibrous tissue or fibrocartilage, which lacks the mechanical characteristics of articular cartilage and fails with time. Recently, tissue engineering has emerged as a new discipline that amalgamates aspects from biology, engineering, materials science, and surgery and that has as a goal the fabrication of functional new tissues to replace damaged tissues. The emergence of tissue engineering has facilitated the generation of new concepts and the revival of old ideas all of which has allowed a fresh approach to the repair or regeneration of tissues such as cartilage. The collaborations between scientists with different backgrounds and expertise has allowed the identification of some key principles that serve as the basis for the development of therapeutic approaches that now are less empiric and more hypothesis-driven than ever before. The current authors review some of the considerations regarding the various models used to test and validate the above repair methods and to address different aspects of the cartilage repair paradigm. Also, some key principles identified from past and current research, the need for the development of new biomaterials, and considerations in scale-up of cell-biomaterial constructs are summarized.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Sch Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Univ Hosp Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Goldberg, VM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Sch Med, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,"Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,45,80,82,1,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-921X,1528-1132,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Biomaterials have been shown to affect the respiratory burst response of surface-adhering leukocytes, thus interfering with major regulatory functions of cells also in surrounding tissues. The respiratory burst of surface-adhering leukocytes may thus be a key event in the understanding of biomaterial interaction with tissues, and the aim of this review is to highlight this field of research.

This article reviews the results and conclusions obtained by several studies investigating the hemocompatibility, in vitro biocompatibility, inflammatory response, and in vivo tissue reactions of these two reference materials. Variable results obtained with LDPE and PDMS in ex vivo hemocompatibility studies were attributed to the type of animal model used, the flow velocity of the circulating blood, the time of exposure, and the methodology used to measure blood cell adhesion or activation at the surface of the materials. In contrast, both the LDPE and PDMS appeared to be suitable reference materials when used in in vitro biocompatibility, inflammatory response, and in vivo studies. However, caution must be taken when interpreting the results, because gamma sterilization of these two materials as well as their origin (for example PDMS) are two critically important factors. In conclusion, we see a definite need for standardized hemocompatible parameters and better high-quality hemocompatibility studies on PRM. This review also suggests other materials as potential PRM candidates, namely, Biomer((R)) and Intra-medic (TM) polyethylene.

Currently different types of biomaterial particles are being developed as bone-substitute materials. Before these biomaterials can be applied their mechanical and biological behavior should be characterized. In this study the time-dependent mechanical behavior of biomaterial particles with different tri-calcium-phosphate/hydroxy-apatite (TCP:HA) ratios, particle sizes, and porosities is determined and compared to the behavior of human bone grafts, the latter being the standard material currently used to augment bone defects. The mechanical properties were assessed with the use of dynamic confined compression creep tests with a loading and unloading phase. Different graft material groups were tested, consisting of 100% human bone grafts, 100% biomaterial particles, and 50:50 weight mixtures of human grafts and biomaterial particles. No damage to the particles was observed by the impaction in the test chamber or by the dynamic load. Relative to the human graft material, the biomaterial particles hardly deformed under loading, were much stiffer, and showed almost no viscoelastic behavior. The mixtures showed intermediate results. Particle size and porosity influenced the behavior of the biomaterial particles. TCP:HA ratio did not have a great effect. The conclusion is that the application of these particles should be done with great care, as their mechanical behavior is drastically different than that of the human graft material. Mixing it with human bone grafts gave the material some biphasic, viscoelastic behavior that may be important for its biological response.

Increased susceptibility to infection at these surgical sites appears to be associated with defective local phagocytic killing. The mechanisms for neutrophil down-regulation, however, continue to be obscure. We have recently demonstrated that cytotoxic substances are released from granulocytes associated with materials. One group of releasants, the cationic human neutrophil peptide(s) (also called defensins) not only impairs the antimicrobial capacity of the granulocyte that releases it but also impairs bystander phagocytes. Because plasma or matrix proteins soon become associated with implants, we investigated the interactive effect of adding these proteins, singly and in combination, on the microbicidal effect of bystander cells. Some plasma/matrix proteins (whole plasma, albumin, fibrinogen, and fibronectin) strongly interfered with the anti-microbicidal effects generated by neutrophil-polystyrene interaction. Other proteins (vitronectin and laminin) were without effect. These results suggest that protein composition at the prosthetic implant site could have a significant effect on infectivity, depending on whether neutrophils releasants were attenuated. In the absence of attenuation, the local environment would be hostile to host defenses, permitting bacterial survival and proliferation.

These PPy-coated fabrics, PPy-Phos and PPy-Plas, were sterilized with ethylene oxide (EO) and the following characterizations were performed: surface morphology by scanning electron microscope, EO residuals analysis by the headspace method, acute systemic toxicity in the mouse model, hemolysis, blood coagulation time, viability and proliferation of endothelial cells measured with the WST-1 method, and activation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells indicated by the specific expression of interleukin 8 mRNA measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Virgin polyester fabrics, expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE), and medical-grade Bionate(R) 80A poly(carbonate urethane) were used as references in the cell culture experiments. The PPy-coated fabrics revealed different surface morphologies by showing more PPy lamina and clusters on the PPy-Plas. Neither of the PPy-coated fabrics had an adverse effect on hemolysis and coagulation time, and they did not cause any acute systemic toxicity. The EO residual level was as low as 5 ppm or less, which is considered quite acceptable. Although exhibiting a relatively low initial cell adhesion at 24 h, the two PPy-coated samples showed no cytotoxicity at 72 and 168 h. Bionate(R) 80A and ePTFE recorded cytotoxicity at 72 and 168 h, respectively. The virgin fabrics also demonstrated a decrease of viable cells at 72 h that was not significant. The activation of PMN cells induced by both PPy-coated fabrics, the ePTFE, and the negative control was significantly lower than that induced by their respective tumor necrosis factor-alpha controls. These results therefore highlighted the potential of PPy-coated fabrics for use as cardiovascular prostheses. It was suggested that cell adhesion moieties should be incorporated into the PPy/fabric composite to increase cell adhesion and subsequent cell proliferation.

The cultures were analyzed for individual cell morphology after 5 days of growing using scanning electron microscopy. Fracture preparations of the cubes showed that cells could infiltrate the porous structures, but the cell shapes varied from individual round-shaped cells to wide spread cells and cell clusters, depending on the material. Also, the differentiation of the seeded cells was dissimilar after a 5-day incubation. The specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity (ALP/ DNA) measured in the supernatants of alpha -TCP-grown cells was nine times higher than the lowest activity, as observed by cells incubated on GB9N. Early (Collagen1, ALP) and late marker (osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein) of osteoblastic differentiation were proofed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cells grown on bone substitutes and bioglass seem to be less differentiated than alpha -TCP-grown cells, because of noticeably less amounts of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. The cultivation on GB9N seems to dedifferentiate the cells, because even the ALP expression was reduced as well. Our results indicate that distinct bone substitutes influence proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells in different manners. These results might influence the selection of an adequate bone substitute for clinical use as well, part from degradative and biomechanical properties.

Setting: Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices, Department of Ophthalmology, Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Methods: Five groups of rigid and foldable IOLs were analyzed in an in vitro test for the percentage of silicone oil adherence: a single-piece foldable hydrophilic-acrylic IOL (n = 9); a single-piece rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOL with HSM coating of the lens optic (n = 9); a 3-piece foldable silicone optic IOL with HSM coating of the optic (n = 10); a single-piece standard rigid PMMA IOL (n = 7); and a standard 3-piece foldable silicone optic IOL (n = 9). After the IOLs were immersed in water and then in silicone oil, gross photographs taken. Image analysis was performed to evaluate the percentage of silicone oil coverage of the anterior and posterior surfaces of each IOL optic. Results: The mean silicone oil coverage of the hydrophilic-acrylic IOLs was 5.6% +/- 2.5% (SID); of the HSM PMMA IOLs, 6.2% +/- 4.3%; of the HSM silicone optic IOLs, 6.7% +/- 3.2%; and of the standard PMMA IOLs, 20.3% +/- 13.3%. The mean silicone oil coverage was greatest on the standard silicone optic IOLs, 98.2% +/- 3.1 %. Conclusions: Intraocular lenses with a hydrophilic optic have less tendency toward adherence to silicone oil than more hydrophobic designs. A foldable silicone IOL with heparin surface modification can significantly reduce potential silicone oil adherence, comparable to the level achievable with the rigid HSM PMMA designs. Two new foldable IOL styles, the HSM silicone IOL and IOLs in the general class of hydrophilic-acrylic, were highly efficacious in reducing silicone oil adherence. There is now a real choice of foldable lenses for patients with actual or potential vitreoretinal diseases.

At the same time, these models are not representative of many real (and particularly anatomical) materials. As a result, new nonlinear models have been developed by Fung and other researchers for biomaterials. However before them, one of the generalized model of viscoelasticity has been developed by Knopoff and MacDonald. Here this model is considered and applied for evaluation of blood vessel wall characteristics. Unlike the convenient models, this model is based on fundamental thermodynamic concepts, and takes into account some more realistic features of viscoelastic solids.

Higher temperature TSDC spectra (250-350 K) provided the alpha relaxation peaks associated with the glass transition temperature. The direct signal analysis (DSA) method allowed the deconvolution of the peaks into elementary processes and the determination of their mean relaxation parameters. The variations in the low and high temperature polarization with the number of backbone methylene groups were interpreted as a combination of flexibility and entanglement phenomena. The dielectric manifestation of the disentanglement effects was observed for the case of the longest polymer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Furthermore, known literature and new results about platelet adhesion on regioselectively modified polysaccharides such as HE, chitosan with HE-like functional groups, and sulfated cellulose are presented in two different perfusion systems at different shear rates. Regioselectively modified polysaccharides were tested as coatings of two polymers. The strongest influence on platelet adhesion was observed when the three regioselectively modified polysaccharides contained 6-O-sulfo- groups. No or little influence was seen with 3-O-sulfo- groups. A variable effect on platelet adhesion was found in position 2. N-sulfo- groups in HE induced a medium platelet adhesion, and O-sulfo- groups of iduronic acid moiety in HE induced none. Cellulose containing 2-O-sulfo- groups induced little platelet adhesion, and 2-N-sulfo- groups in chitosan induced a variable platelet adhesion response, depending on the N-SO3/NAc ratio. Preliminary plasma protein adhesion measurements on immobilized HE derivatives with four different fluorescence-labeled plasma proteins showed a regioselective influence with serum albumin and fibrinogen. 6-O-desulfated HE gave the strongest reduction in protein adsorption followed by N-desulfation and 2-O-desulfation; the lowest reduction was observed with 3-O-desulfation. Tailor-made athrombogenic coatings of HE should not carry high amounts of 6-O-sulfo- groups or of N-sulfo- groups. Regioselectively modified cellulose and chitosan may become suitable for tailor-made athrombogenic biomaterials when regioselective reactions are further optimized.","Univ Aachen, ITMC, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Baumann, H (reprint author), Univ Aachen, ITMC, Worringer Weg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",Baumann@RWTH-Aachen.de,,,,,,61,10,15,0,3,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"333 SEVENTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10001 USA",0094-6176,1098-9064,,SEMIN THROMB HEMOST,Semin.

This paper critically reviews methodological approaches and presents aspects of this research. Selected examples presented include micro and nanostructure and properties of biomaterials surfaces, molecular level interactions at biomaterial-biomolecule interfaces, interfaces between biomaterials and mineralised tissues as well as advances of mineralised tissue research.

Prior to contact with cells or tissues, biomaterials have to be sterilized. However, many sterilization procedures such as steam autoclave or heat sterilization are known to strongly affect polymer properties. UV irradiation is used as an alternative sterilization method in many tissue engineering laboratories on a routine basis, however, potential alterations of polymer properties have not been extensively considered, In this study we investigated the effects of UV irradiation on spin-cast films made from biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-monomethyl ether diblock copolymers (Me.PEG-PLA) which have recently been developed for controlled cell-biomaterial interaction. After 2 h of UV irradiation, which is sufficient for sterilization, no alterations in cell adhesion to polymer films were detected, as demonstrated with 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This correlated with unchanged film topography and molecular weight distribution. However, extended UV irradiation for 5-24 h elicited drastic responses regarding Me.PEG-PLA polymer properties and interactions with biological elements: Large increases in unspecific protein adsorption and subsequent cell adhesion were observed, Changes in polymer surface properties could be correlated with the observed alterations in cell/protein-polymer interactions. Atomic force microscopy analysis of polymer films revealed a marked ""smoothing"" of the polymer surface after UV irradiation. Investigations using GPC, H-1-NMR, mass spectrometry, and a PEG-specific colorimetric assay demonstrated that polymer film composition was time-dependently affected by exposure to UV irradiation, i.e., that large amounts of PEG were lost from the copolymer surface. The data indicate that sterilization using UV irradiation for 2 h is an appropriate technique for the recently synthesized Me.PEG-PLA diblock copolymers. However, the study also serves as an example that it is indispensable to control the duration of exposure to UV irradiation for a given biomaterial in order not to compromise polymer properties relevant to tissue engineering purposes.

This two-phase structure (i.e. hard and soft segment phases) has unique features which contribute to its mechanical stability and moderate biocompatibility at the surface. As AFM was used to study the structure of six different polyurethane elastomers, where the reagent stoichiometrics, as well as the chemistry of the hard segments, were changed.

During previous hip simulator validation studies, researchers have correlated the mechanical behavior and surface morphology of polymeric biomaterials with the wear performance in a hip simulator. For the present study, we sought correlations between clinical performance and quantitative metrics of the mechanical behavior and surface morphology of retrieved cups. Nine all-UHMWPE acetabular cups of the same cemented design, 32 mm head size, and manufacturer were retrieved after an average implantation time of 14.1 years (range: 11.5-16.4 years). The implants were manufactured from RCH-1000, sterilized by gamma radiation in air and implanted between 1980 and 1983. Mechanical behavior of the retrieved components was determined using the previously validated small punch test, which subjects miniature specimens to multi-axial loading conditions. Surface morphology of the retrievals was assessed using white light interferometry. No significant relationship was observed between the surface roughness measurements and patient related variables. However, statistically significant relationships were observed between the mechanical behavior determined by the small punch test and the implantation time and patient weight associated with the retrieved hip cups. These findings support the hypothesis that the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE is related, at least in part, to the clinical performance of acetabular component bearings for total hip replacement.

The increment of removal should result from the synergistic effect of mechanical and corrosive losses of materials, i.e. the acceleration of corrosion by fretting and the increase of fretting by corrosion. The fretting corrosion behaviors of three biomaterials, 316L stainless steel, Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V alloys were investigated. The total removals of materials should come from five components, pure corrosion, pure wear, corrosion increment caused by fretting, fretting increment caused by corrosion and synergy. Experimental results showed that the dissolution processes of three materials were accelerated significantly by fretting. The approximate removals of materials caused by synergy in saline solution are 31.6% for 316L stainless steel, 15.3% for Co-Cr-Mo alloy and 7.2% for Ti-6Al-4V alloy of total loss, respectively. The corrosion alone was a small percentage, just accounting for about 3% of total loss for three materials. The synergistic process of three materials was discussed based on three important stages, pure fretting, pure corrosion and synergy. The results suggested that both factors of materials and surface contact state should be considered simultaneously for the protection of three biomaterials under fretting corrosion conditions. The possible mechanism responsible for synergy between fretting and corrosion was also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, HCPS has efficiently bound to collagen-coated micro-plates and collagen membranes thereby retaining the binding of heparin-binding growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(165) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Both human skin fibroblast cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells have shown a good adherence to both collagen- and HCPS-bound collagen substrata. The growth rate of the fibroblast cells on the HCPS-bound collagen substratum in the presence of low concentrations of FGF-2 is higher than on a collagen surface. The fibroblast cells grow at a significantly higher rate on the HCPS-bound collagen substratum retained with FGF-2. Similarly, the growth rate of the endothelial cells on the HCPS-bound collagen substrata in the presence of low concentrations of either FGF-2 or VEGF(165) is higher than on collagen. The endothelial cells also grow at a significantly higher rate on the HCPS-bound collagen substratum retained with either FCF-2 or VEGF(165).

However, canines spontaneously re-endothelialize vascular grafts, whereas humans do not, even after years. This raises questions of why there are differences in vascular healing between humans and other species and whether the canine is the appropriate preclinical model. In the present study we evaluated human and canine endothelial cell (EC) migration on the novel cross-linked collagen biomaterial PhotoFix (TM) pericardium. We compared in vitro migration of these cells on PhotoFix alone and on PhotoFix adsorbed with various growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) and adhesion proteins (fibronectin, collagen IV, vitronectin, and laminin). We also compared human and canine ECs in terms of their morphologies and prostacyclin production. We found that human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and canine ECs (CECs) migrated well on PhotoFix, suggesting that this biomaterial may be a good vascular graft candidate. Both cell types responded similarly to different growth factors and adhesive proteins, but HUVEC migration was consistently higher than that for CECs. This suggested that human in vivo graft re-endothelialization is likely not hindered by poor endothelial migration but is hindered by other cellular or graft properties.

The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14), the elastic constant s(55), and the relative permittivity epsilon (11) were obtained for the collagen and collagen-chitosan films. Resonance measurement of the piezoelectric strain constant d(14) of collagen gives 0.096 pC N-1, which is in good agreement with values reported in the literature, measured using other techniques. It was observed that addition of 15% of chitosan increased the piezoelectricity to 0.212 pC N-1. The frequency constant f L and the piezoelectric strain element d(14), obtained for this sample, present the highest value for the samples under study (427.24 kHz m and 0.212 pC N-1). This value for the d(14) element is of the same order as that obtained for bovine bone (d(14) = 0.2 pC N-1) (T.G. Netto and R.L. Ziemmerman, Biophys..T.,1975,15, 573), which is about one-tenth of the piezoelectric constant d(11) of quartz crystal. Our results also show that the presence of chitosan contributes to an increase in the thermal stability of the collagen films, which is associated with an increase in the denaturation temperature of the collagen-chitosan samples compared with the collagen sample. We believe that the increase in the organization of the microscopic structure of the sample, results in an increase in the piezoelectricity. These high values for the frequency constant and piezoelectricity, give the possibility of using these films in electronic devices based on acoustic waves (e.g. surface acoustic wave devices (SAW)) which operate in the MHz frequency range using piezoelectric substrates.","Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fis, Dept Quim Organ & Inorgan, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fis, Lab Opt Linear & Ciencia Mat, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Engn Mecan, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Ctr Ciencias, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil","Silva, CC (reprint author), Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fis, Dept Quim Organ & Inorgan, Caixa Postal 6030, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",sombra@ufc.br,"UFC, DF/E-1564-2017; Universidade Federal do Ceara, Physics Department/J-4630-2016; Sombra, Antonio/B-2963-2013; Candido Silva, Cleber/I-6434-2012","Universidade Federal do Ceara, Physics Department/0000-0002-9247-6780; Goes, Julio Cesar/0000-0002-6324-7647; Goncalves Pinheiro, Alexandre/0000-0001-5457-6484",,,,15,14,19,1,14,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9076,1463-9084,,PHYS CHEM CHEM PHYS,Phys.

Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering bacteria after 4 h were higher on hydrophilic glass than on hydrophobic silicone rubber, regardless of growth conditions. The presence of 1/4 minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin during growth reduced enterococcal adhesion to both substrata, but growth in the presence of 1/4 MIC vancomycin did not affect the adhesion of E faecalis. Moreover, enterococcal adhesion increased after growth in the presence of 1/8 MIC vancomycin. The increased adhesion after growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin may have strong implications for patients living with implanted biomaterials, as they may suffer adverse effects from use of this antibiotic, especially since bacteria once adhered are less sensitive to antibiotics.

Surface peroxide concentrations resulting from the argon plasma treatment and subsequent atmospheric exposure were determined by a coupling reaction with diphenylpicrylhydrazyl. The results suggested that a short plasma treatment time of 10 s and brief air exposure were sufficient for generating an optimum amount of peroxides and hydroperoxides for the subsequent W-induced graft polymerization. The graft concentration of the PEGMA polymer increased with increasing PEGMA macromonomer concentration for the graft polymerization and with increasing W graft polymerization time. The PEGMA graft-polymerized silicon surface with a high poly(ethylene glycol) graft concentration was very effective in preventing protein adsorption and platelet adhesion. The grafted PEGMA polymer layer on the Si(100) surface exhibited fairly good stability during storage in a buffer solution.

Patterns were created on the films by application of modified micro fabrication-based phorolithographic techniques. The technique was used to create patterns with depths from 5 to 80 mum. In addition, various polymers were incorporated, including polyethylene glycol methacrylates, styrene, and methacrylic acid, to synthesize regions with different physico-chemical properties.

Although antifouling properties of surface-grafted dextran and PEG are quite similar, surface-bound dextran has multiple reactive sites for high-density surface immobilization of biologically active molecules. We recently reported nontoxic aqueous methods to covalently immobilize dextran on material surfaces. These dextran coatings effectively limited cell adhesion and spreading in the presence of serum-borne cell adhesion proteins. In this study we utilized the same nontoxic aqueous methods to graft cell adhesion peptides on low protein-binding dextran monolayer surfaces. Chemical composition of all modified surfaces was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surface-grafted cell adhesion peptides stimulated endothelial cell, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cell attachment and spreading in vitro. In contrast, surface-grafted inactive peptide sequences did not promote high levels of cell interaction. Surface-grafted high affinity cyclic RGD peptides promoted cell type-dependent interactions. With dextran-based surface coatings, it will be possible to develop well-defined surface modifications that promote specific cell interactions and perhaps better performance in long-term biomaterial implants.

In Phase 2, eight sheep underwent surgical implantation of four pellets in metaphyseal defects, Defects were sealed with polymethylmethacrylate in both phases. Healing of the defects was evaluated at 7 weeks (Phase 1, n = 11) and 14 weeks (M =19) with computed tomography, histology, and histomorphometry. Complications in Phase 1 included four femoral fractures and migration of cement seals (18/102 defects). No complications occurred in Phase 2. Whereas no difference was found between left and right limbs, osteogenesis and incorporation of biomaterials varied among implantation sites. For comparison of grafting materials, treatment site allocations were randomized according to a Latin square design. This model allows evaluation of several impacted aggregates (including large particles) in the same animal. It is particularly suitable for analyzing the biologic properties of grafting materials prior to evaluation under loading conditions.

The life cycle of this alga is complex and is distinguished by its ability to synthesize exquisitely sculptured calcium carbonate cell coverings known as coccoliths. These structures have been targeted by materials scientists for applications relating to the chemistry of biomedical materials, robust membranes for high-temperature separation technology, lightweight ceramics, and semiconductor design. To date, however, the molecular and biochemical events controlling coccolith production have not been determined. In addition, little is known about the life cycle of E. huxleyi and the environmental and physiological signals triggering phase switching between the diploid and haploid life cycle stages. We have developed laboratory methods for inducing phase variation between the haploid (S-cell) and diploid (C-cell) life cycle stages of E. huxleyi. Plating E. huxleyi C cells on solid media was shown to induce phase switching from the C-cell to the S-cell life cycle stage, the latter of which has been maintained for over 2 years under these conditions. Pure cultures of S cells were obtained for the first time. Laboratory conditions for inducing phase switching from the haploid stage to the diploid stage were also established. Regeneration of the C-cell stage from pure cultures of S cells followed a predictable pattern involving formation of large aggregations of S cells and the subsequent production of cultures consisting predominantly of diploid C cells. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate the life cycle of E. huxleyi under controlled laboratory conditions, providing us with powerful tools for the development of genetic techniques for analysis of coccolithogenesis and for investigating the complex life cycle of this important marine alga.","Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol Sci, San Marcos, CA 92096 USA","Wahlund, TM (reprint author), Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol Sci, 333 S Twin Oaks Valley Rd, San Marcos, CA 92096 USA.",twahlund@mailhost1.csusm.edu,,,,,,38,11,15,1,13,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

The Omnicarbon and Omniscience valves are identical in form but differ in that the Omnicarbon valve is constructed entirely of pyrolytic carbon, whereas the Omniscience valve uses titanium for its housing, the rest of its structure being pyrolytic carbon. The literature was reviewed and a comparison in similar groups of patients was made between these two model valves for their thromboembolic rates in the mitral and aortic positions. A total of 569 aortic Omnicarbon valves (4,146 patient years [pt yrs.]) had a thromboembolic events (T/E rate) of 0.5% compared with 1.7% for 468 aortic Omniscience (1,552 pt yrs); p < 0.0001.

There was no difference in the anticoagulation management between the two model valves although the Omniscience valve required higher prothrombin or International Normalized Rate maintenance levels, which resulted in higher bleeding rates among patients with Omniscience valves.","Natl Lib Med, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA","Phillips, SJ (reprint author), Natl Lib Med, NIH, Bldg 38,Room 2E17,8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA.",,,,,,,34,7,7,1,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,SEP-OCT,2001.0,47,5,,,,,429,431,,10.1097/00002480-200109000-00002,,,,3,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,472QV,WOS:000170997200002,11575807.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

This contact between blood and the biomaterials of implants and extracorporeal circuits leads to an inflammatory response mediated by the complement system. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a complement regulator (factor H) immobilised on a biomaterial surface to inhibit complement cascade mediated inflammatory responses. The cross-linker-N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate was used to immobilise factor H on a model biomaterial surface without affecting the biological activity of the inhibitor. Binding of factor H was then characterised using quartz crystal micro balance-dissipation (QCM-D) and enzyme immunoassays for products of complement activation: bound C3 fragments and soluble C3a, sC5b-9, and C1s-C1INA. Immobilised factor H reduced the amount C3 fragments deposited on the biomaterial surface after incubation with serum, plasma, or whole blood. In addition, lower levels of soluble C3a, and sC5b-9 were generated after incubation with whole blood.

For these reasons, it has been used for the fabrication of temporary stents, bone plates, nails and screws (Peng et al. Biomaterials 1996;17:685). In some cases, the brittle mechanical properties of PHB homopolymer limit its application. A typical plasticizer, triethylcitrate (TEC), was used to overcome such limitations by making the material more pliable, In the past few years, CO2-laser cutting of PHB was used in the manufacturing of small medical devices such as stents. Embrittlement of plasticized PHB tubes has been observed, after laser machining. Consequently, the physicochemical and morphological properties of laser-processed surfaces and cut edges of plasticized polymer samples were examined to determine the extent of changes in polymer properties as a result of laser machining. These studies included determination of the depth of the laser-induced heat affected zone by polariscopy of thin polymer sections. Molecular weight changes and changes in the TEC content as a function of distance from the laser-cut edge were determined. In a preliminary test, the cellular response to the processed material was investigated by cell culture study of L929 mouse fibroblasts on laser-machined surfaces. The heat-affected zone was readily classified into four different regions with a total depth of about 60 to 100 mum (Klamp, Master Thesis, University of Rostock, 1998). These results correspond well with the chemical analysis and molecular weight measurements. Furthermore, it was found that cells grew preferentially on the laser-machined area. These findings have significant implications for the manufacture of medical implants from PHB by laser machining. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The time courses of piezoelectric parameters were used to reflect the changes of interfacial physical properties, such as mass, density-viscosity, and dielectric constant, during the adsorptions of peptide and fullerols onto electrode. The electrochemical impedance based on the simple equivalent electric network were also simultaneously measured and provided electrochemical interface information, e.g., double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance. It was found that the double-impedance responses were varied with the forms of glutathione. It was also shown that the frequency curves due to the adsorption of oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione could be exhibited as different kinetic equations. The heterogeneous charge-transfer rate constants of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide before and after the peptide and fullerols adsorption were determined by CV and EIS methods. The results showed that the proposed method has potential applications in interfacial studies of biomaterials, since these combined techniques have advantages in real time providing multidimensional piezoelectric and electrochemical impedance information.

RKKP is a glass well known for its bioactivity; therefore, a RKKP coating on Al2O3 or ZrO2, allows to combine the excellent mechanical properties of these strong ceramic substrates with its bioactivity. ZrO2 samples were easily coated using a double layer of RKKP by a simple enamelling technique. To accommodate the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Al2O3 and RKKP, this substrate was coated using a multilayered composite approach. All of the coatings were characterised from a morphological and compositional point of view, and an extensive biological evaluation was performed using fresh rat osteoblasts. Osteoblast primary Cultures were derived from the trabecular bone of femoral condyles harvested from intact (NB) and osteopenic (OB) rats. After characterisation of their phenotype, osteoblasts were seeded on material samples of ZrO2 or Al2O3 coated with RKKP, and cultured for 7 days. Cell proliferation (MTT test) and cell differentiation (alkaline phosphatase activity) were evaluated at the end of the experiment, to assess osteoblast behaviour in the presence of biomaterials and determine if the results were related to the host bone quality. Results of both materials showed a good level of biocompatibility. In particular, MTT significant higher values were detected in NB cultures on ZrO2-RKKP samples; ALP activity significantly increased in NB cultures on Al2O3-RKKP and in OB cultures on both coated samples.

Different ceramics may, however, differ in composition and physico-chemical surface properties, which may be changed after corrosion. The aim of this study was to examine the adsorption of proteins onto specimens of different ceramic materials after the incubation in saliva and plasma before and after in vitro corrosion. In addition, the topography of the biofilm was examined by AFM. Surface-bound proteins were desorbed and analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting using antibodies to saliva and plasma proteins. Silver-stained gels indicated differences in the adsorption of proteins. Differences in surface roughness at the nanometer level did not, however, seem to be correlated to the protein adsorption. After corrosion, unchanged or increased protein staining was generally seen in the gels and Western blots. The reactions for salivary amylase and proline-rich proteins varied between the different materials. Albumin and fibrinogen were identified in samples from all materials tested. Fibronectin and in specific IgA were more sparsely seen. No saliva but all plasma proteins were identified in the alumina and yttria-stabilised zirconia samples and reduced protein reactions were obtained after corrosion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing integrated microsystems for biological and biomedical processing and analysis. We report development of selective surface modification techniques based on microcontact printing and polyelectrolyte adsorption. These techniques were applied to lithographically patterned silicon microfluidic channels and flat silicon substrates to create surface microstructures with contrasting wetting properties and surface charges. These controls enabled us to devise various techniques for controlled loading and processing of biomaterials in the channels. Solutions containing long chain biological macromolecules DNA and microtubules were directly loaded into the microchannels by using a micromanipulator/microinjector system. Structural arrangements of these linear macromolecules, which were probed by using fluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy, were found to be quite different from bulk solutions. As expected, the filamentous molecules were observed to align linearly along the channels, with the degree of alignment dependent on channel width as well as the length of the molecule. This molecular alignment, which is induced by both the surface confinement effect and capillary flow during sample loading, may be used to enhance processing of biological materials in silicon biomedical microdevices. It also opens up the possibility of carrying out direct combinatorial structural characterization of proteins in the microchannels utilizing X-ray diffraction, which so far has not been possible.","[Li, Youli; Pfohl, Thomas; Kim, Joon Heon; Yassa, Mario; Kim, Mahn Won; Safinya, Cyrus R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Dept Phys, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Li, Youli; Pfohl, Thomas; Kim, Joon Heon; Yassa, Mario; Kim, Mahn Won; Safinya, Cyrus R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Biochem & Mol Biol Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Wen, Zhiyu] Chongqing Univ, Coll Optoelect Engn, Chongqing 630044, Peoples R China; [Kim, Joon Heon; Kim, Mahn Won] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Li, YL (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Dept Phys, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",youli@mrl.ucsb.edu,"Pfohl, Thomas/D-7296-2016","Pfohl, Thomas/0000-0002-7879-5216",NIH [GM59288]; University of California Biotech Research and Education training [99-14]; DFG [pf 375/1-1]; Chongqing University through the Ministry of Education of China; KISTEP [99-I-01-03-A-064];  [NSF-DMR-9972246];  [NSF-DMR-0076357];  [ONR-N00014-00-1-0214];  [NSF-DMR-0080034],"This work was supported by NSF-DMR-9972246, NSF-DMR-0076357, ONR-N00014-00-1-0214, NIH Grant GM59288, and the University of California Biotech Research and Education training grant 99-14.

The displacement of the microspheres was in phase with the movement of the laser trap at frequencies less than 1 rad/s, indicating that at least locally, the gels behaved as elastic media.

It was found that none of the biomaterials was infected by hematogenous spread, whereas 5% of the implants were infected by perioperative contamination. We conclude that late hematogenous infection of subcutaneous biomaterials does not occur in the rat. For humans as well, there are growing doubts whether implants actually become infected through hematogenous routes; it is thought that late infections may be caused by delayed appearance of perioperatively introduced bacteria.","Univ Groningen, Fac Med Sci, Dept Biomed Engn, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Fac Med Sci, Dept Cell Biol, Immunol Sect, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands","Busscher, HJ (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Fac Med Sci, Dept Biomed Engn, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,27,5,5,0,2,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",1071-412X,,,CLIN DIAGN LAB IMMUN,Clin.

Such drug delivery systems differ from conventional drug dosage forms (pills, tablets, ointments, creams, injectables and 'tiny time capsules') in that a localised depot of drug provides patterned release of the active agent with a predetermined time course. The pattern of drug release may be constant, oscillating, declining continuously, or even pulsatile. The need to engineer different release patterns for drugs of different molecular sizes, potency, stability and hydrophobicity provides the impetus for active study of the design of new biomaterials, intelligent delivery systems and approaches for delivery through different portals in the body. The field of controlled drug delivery provides a driving force for current innovations in biomaterials. For most drug delivery systems, polymers function simply as inert, biocompatible carriers.

The screws were tested biomechanically (extraction torque) and histomorphometrically (affinity index: Al) 12 weeks after their implantation in tibia! diaphyses. Tibial cortical bone parameters showed significant differences between the groups, showing a reduction of the selected parameters in the OVX group. ANOVA showed significant effects for both material and ovariectomy factors on obtained extraction torque (material: F=159.26, p < 0.0005; ovariectomy: F=20.04, p < 0.0005) and AI data (material: F=8.04, p < 0.001; ovariectomy: F=7.17, p < 0.05). In both groups the extraction torque for coated screws of both materials was significantly higher than for uncoated screws, and uncoated titanium had a better extraction torque than uncoated stainless steel. In the OVX group, the HA-coated stainless steel and titanium AI data were significantly higher than uncoated Al data. In conclusion, the biomechanical and histomorphological results obtained suggest employing HA-coated screws in the presence of osteopenic cortical bone.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Codivilla Putti Res Inst, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Sch Med, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Rocca, M (reprint author), IOR, Serv Chirurg Sperimentale, Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, Via di Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,36,27,28,0,2,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Setting. Research Department, Allergan Inc., Irvine, California, USA. Methods. Intraocular lens (IOL) optic materials were implanted intramuscularly and/or subcutaneously in rabbits for up to 90 days. The materials included silicone, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogel, and several hydrophobic acrylic materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to detect calcification demonstrated by characteristic discrete nodules containing both calcium and phosphate. Histological methods were used to evaluate tissue reactivity. Disc lenses fabricated from the experimental material were also bilaterally implanted in rabbit eyes that were monitored by slitlamp biomicroscopy. The lenses were explanted at 1, 2, 5.5, 10, and 20 months for SEM/EDS analysis. Results: No calcification was noted in the intramuscularly or subcutaneously implanted silicone, PMMA, and acrylic optic materials. Calcification was noted on the intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intraocularly implanted experimental acrylic and the intramuscularly implanted hydrogel material; the calcification was more extensive on the hydrogel, Signs that suggested intraocular calcification were first noted on the experimental IOLs at 4 months, but calcification was not confirmed until 10 months. Conclusions: Material calcification occurred more quickly in an intramuscular or subcutaneous environment than in an intraocular environment. Intramuscular and subcutaneous implantation appears to be an excellent model for screening materials for calcification potential. However, calcification is both host environment and material dependent. Using intramuscular or subcutaneous implantation in animal models to predict intraocular calcification in humans must be done with caution.","Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Irvine, CA 92623 USA","Buchen, SY (reprint author), Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, 2525 Dupont Dr,POB 19534, Irvine, CA 92623 USA.",,,,,,,16,23,24,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Most manifestations of candidiasis are associated with biofilm formation, with cells in biofilms displaying properties dramatically different from free-living cells grown under normal laboratory conditions. Here, we report on the development of in vitro models of C. dabliniensis biofilms on the surfaces of biomaterials (polystyrene and acrylic) and on the characteristics associated with biofilm formation by this newly described species. Time course analysis using a formazan salt reduction assay to monitor metabolic activities of cells within the biofilm, together with microscopy studies, revealed that biofilm formation by C. dubliniensis occurred after initial focal adherence, followed by growth, proliferation, and maturation over 24 to 48 h. Serum and saliva preconditioning films enhanced the initial attachment of C. dubliniensis and subsequent biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to further characterize C. dubliniensis biofilms. Mature C. dubliniensis biofilms consisted of a dense network of yeasts cells and hyphal elements embedded within exopolymeric material. C. dubliniensis biofilms displayed spatial heterogeneity and an architecture showing microcolonies with ramifying water channels. Antifungal susceptibility testing demonstrated the increased resistance of sessile C. dubliniensis cells, including the type strain and eight different clinical isolates, against fluconazole and amphotericin B compared to their planktonic counterparts. C. dubliniensis biofilm formation may allow this species to maintain its ecological niche as a commensal and during infection with important clinical repercussions.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, S Texas Ctr Biol Med, Dept Med,Div Infect Dis, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA","Lopez-Ribot, JL (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, S Texas Ctr Biol Med, Dept Med,Div Infect Dis, Texas Res Pk,15355 Lambda Dr, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA.",,"Lopez-Ribot, Jose/D-2048-2010",,,,,65,108,114,0,7,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0095-1137,,,J CLIN MICROBIOL,J.

The properties of the collagen substrate can be manipulated, for example, by crosslinking, to optimize desirable properties such as cell growth and penetration into the substrate, biological stability and mechanical strength. Collagen sponges crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) and the diamine, diaminohexane, were used to determine the effect of crosslinking on pore size and morphology, on the stability of the crosslinked sponges both in cell culture media and during incubation with collagenase, and on the penetration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts through the sponge matrix. Crosslinking of the sponges reduced the pore size, particularly at the surface, and altered sponge morphology. After crosslinking the collagen fibers were thinner, and appeared lacy and delicate. Crosslinking also influenced sponge stability. In keratinocyte serum-free medium the pore size of plain collagen sponges increased with increasing incubation time, and crosslinking appeared to prevent this, and may have stabilized sponge structure. Incubation in serum-containing Dulbecco's minimum essential medium caused a marked reduction in pore size in both plain collagen and crosslinked collagen sponges. Crosslinking did not appear to influence this cell-free contraction of collagen sponges. Treatment of sponges with EDAC markedly increased the resistance of sponges to collagenase digestion. The penetration of both keratinocytes and fibroblasts was retarded by crosslinking the sponges. Fibroblasts penetrated through the sponges to a greater extent than keratinocytes, and their proliferation rate was faster. The total number of cells populating the crosslinked sponges after 10 days culture was approximately 50% of that on untreated collagen sponges. The mechanism responsible for this effect was different with the two crosslinkers used. Diaminohexane appeared to inhibit cell growth, whereas EDAC may have caused a decrease in cell adhesion to the sponges, without an apparent inhibition of growth rate. In terms of morphology, fibroblasts were elongated to a greater extent on crosslinked sponges, and alligned themselves along the collagen fibers. Keratinocytes grew in colonies on untreated sponges, but on crosslinked sponges they grew in isolation, with minimal cell-cell interactions. It may be necessary to reach a compromise to obtain the best combination of properties for using collagen sponges as substrata for artificial skin substitutes.

The self-assembly behavior of a recombinant murine amelogenin (rM179) was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for further understanding the roles of amelogenin proteins in dental enamel biomineralization. Recombinant rM179 amelogenin was dissolved in a pH 7.4 Tris-HCl buffer at concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 300 mug/ml. The solutions were adsorbed on mica, fixed with Karnovsky fixative and rinsed thoroughly with water for atomic force microscopy (AFM). At low concentrations (12.5-50 mug/ml), nanospheres with diameters varying from 7 to 53 nm were identified while at concentrations ranging between 100-300 mug/ml the size distribution was significantly narrowed to be steadily between 10 and 25 nm in diameter. These nanospheres were observed to be the basic building blocks of both engineered rM179 gels and of the developing enamel extracellular matrix. The stable 15-20-nm nanosphere structures generated in the presence of high concentrations of amelogenins were postulated to be of great importance in facilitating the highly organized ultrastructural microenvironment required for the formation of initial enamel apatite crystallites.

We studied the influence of the nature of the oligomeric modifier, initially miscible with DCBA, on the chemical structure, glass transition behaviour, phase morphology and mechanical properties of modified PCN. The possibility of PEth incorporation into the PCN structure through mixed cyanurate ring formation is discussed. A maximum PEth incorporated content of 0.1 mol of PEth per mol of DCBA irrespective of PEth type has been detected. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) analysis showed the formation of multiphase polymer compositions due to microphase separation of the components occurring during DCBA/PPG curing. The formation of very finely divided morphologies with highly interpenetrated phases, i.e. a PCN-rich phase, a mixed phase of PCN/PPG components and a PPG-rich phase was determined. On the other hand, all PCN/PTMG cured compositions exhibited a single, broad glass transition that shifted to lower temperature as the modifier content was increased and the experimental T-g versus modifier content showed a slight positive deviation from the Fox equation fur miscible polymer systems. It can be concluded that the PCN and the PTMG have a higher degree of compatibility than PCN and PPG. The introduction of small additions of modifier (< 10 wt%) allow production of the thermosets with high T-g and good strength properties. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Tissue engineering is an exciting new field which enables the cultivation and expansion of individual bladder cells obtained by transurethral biopsy, the attachment of these cells to a support matrix, and their reimplantation into the body. Advances both in biomaterials as well as in the cultivation and expansion of bladder cells are described. Promising routine clinical applications of tissue engineering may still need several years. Free neurovascular muscle transfer to the bladder demonstrated both experimentally and clinically to be a suitable treatment modality in patients with bladder acontractility. This may therefore be the next logical step towards an improved bladder substitute by combining well vascularized flaps with urothelial cell seeding. Thus a combination of commonly used flap techniques and tissue engineering may soon be possible.","Univ Innsbruck, Urol Klin, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Univ Innsbruck, Klin Plast & Wiederherstellungschirurg, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Oulu Univ Hosp, Dept Plast Surg, Oulu, Finland","Stenzl, A (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Urol Klin, Anichstr 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",arnulf-stenzl@uibk.ac.at,,,,,,53,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-2592,,,UROLOGE A,Urologe A,SEP,2001.0,40,5,,,,,368,+,,10.1007/s001200170022,,,,8,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,474LW,WOS:000171109500002,11594210.0,,,,2019-02-25

Perfusion of blood on the polymeric substrates was performed after treatments either with or without preadsorption of 1% blood plasma, and either with or without residence of the protein-preadsorbed substrate in phosphate buffered solution. The surfaces employed were elastic polymers such as poly(ether urethane urea), poly(ether urethane), silicone urethane copolymer, silicone rubber and poly(ether urethane) with the anti-calcifying agent hydroxyethane. bisphosphate. Each polymer surface treated was exposed in vitro to the dynamic, heparinized whole blood perfused for upto 6 min and the surface area of platelets initially adhered was measured by employing in situ epifluorescence video microscopy. The blood perfusion was performed on the surfaces treated at the following three different conditions: directly on the bare surfaces, after protein pre-adsorption and after residence in buffer for 3 days of the surfaces protein pre-adsorbed for 2 h. The effects of blood plasma pre-adsorption on the initial platelet adhesion was surface-dependent. The amount of the adsorbed fibrinogen and the surface coverage area of the adhered platelets were dependent on the surface conditions whether substrates were bare surfaces or protein pre-adsorbed ones. To test an effect of possible morphological (re) orientations of the adsorbed proteins on the initial platelet adhesion, the polymeric substrate pre-adsorbed with 1% blood plasma was immersed in phosphate buffered solution for 3 days and then exposed to physiological blood perfusion. The surface area of the platelets adhered on these surfaces was significantly different from that of the surfaces treated with protein pre-adsorption only. These results indicated that platelet adhesion was dependent on the surface property itself and pre-treatment conditions such as blood perfusion without any pre-adsorption of proteins, and blood perfusion either after protein pre-adsorption or after subsequent substrate residence in buffer of the substrate pre-adsorbed with proteins. Understanding of these results may guide for better designs of blood-contacting materials based on protein behaviors.","Seoul Natl Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Nowon Gu, Seoul 139743, South Korea",,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,2,POLYMER SOC KOREA,SEOUL,"ROOM 601, HATCHON BUILDING, 831 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-792, SOUTH KOREA",1225-5947,,,KOREA POLYM J,Korea Polym.

Critical analysis of solution thermodynamics is made in order to scrutinize trehalose properties often called 'anomalous' and to check the consistency of literature results. Discussion on the conversion between the solid state polymorphic forms is given, with a special emphasis of the transformations involving the newly identified anhydrous crystalline form of alpha,alpha -trehalose, TREalpha. This exotic crystal is almost 'isomorphous' with the dihydrate crystal structure, and possesses the unique feature of reversibly absorbing water to produce the dihydrate, without changing the main structural features. The reversible process could play a functional role in the well-known ability of this sugar to protect biological structures from damage during desiccation. The final aim of the paper is to add some new insights into and to reconcile previous hypotheses for the peculiar 'in vivo' action of trehalose. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

From the observation of the symmetric and antisymmetric stretch vibrations of the glycosidic linkage, it is found that this sugar assumes at least three types of backbone conformations. Among them, the conformation with C-2 symmetry is characterized as 'open state', which means that the sugar easily absorbs water molecules. The conformation of the sugars in anhydrous form II and in freeze-dried trehalose is shown to be in the open state. Next, the hygroscopic properties of the anhydrate, form II and the amorphous solid are compared based on their IR spectra. Interestingly, form II alone is converted to the original dihydrate in a week under mild environmental-like conditions: relative humidity of 40% and room temperature. These results suggest the possibility that form II plays a role in avoiding the devitrification of the sugar glass. Finally, we discuss the role of form II in preserving freeze-dried biomaterials.

In this sensor, an array of microholes is etched through a silicon membrane. On the sidewalls of these microholes, a working electrode is formed by platinum sputtering. On the top of the microholes, a membrane of glucose oxidase (GOD) is deposited. Owing to the separation of the working electrode and the enzyme membrane, standard MEMS processes can be carried out as the front-end processes during the fabrication. The enzyme membrane will be deposited as the last process step. This avoids the problem of incompatibility between MEMS processes and biomaterials. In this way, the glucose sensor can be easily integrated in the microchannel. The diffusion of hydrogen peroxide in the microholes was simulated with different ratios of depth and diameter. It is shown that when the ratio of diameter and depth of the microholes is 1, most of the produced hydrogen peroxide can be oxidized at the working electrode on the sidewalls of microholes. Laser drilling and magnetron RIE were exploited, respectively, to fabricate the array of microholes. The responses of both the stand-alone sensor and the sensor integrated in the microchannel are shown. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The surfactant polymers are comblike polymers consisting of a poly(vinylamine) backbone with 2 kDa PEO and hexanal side chains. The polymers were prepared with various grafting ratios of the two side chains. Surface pressure isotherms were obtained for spread monolayers for the range of polymer compositions. Two transitions are observed at 5 and 11 mN/m, which are interpreted as stages of desorption for the PEO side chains from the interface into the aqueous subphase. It is demonstrated that it is possible to scale the isotherms quantitatively to provide an accurate determination of the side chain composition. We characterized the adsorption process of two of the surfactant polymers at the water-graphite interface, using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). With high hexanal:PEO content (e.g., 8:1), the surfactant polymer rapidly forms a compact and complete monolayer 1.2 nm thick. At lower hexanal:PEO content (e.g., 4:1), a disordered layer is formed. After several hours, this layer rearranges into small scattered domains with banded structures. The structure of these layers is interpreted using a model of surface adsorption and the surface pressure isotherms.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Macromol Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Marchant, RE (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Macromol Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,"Holland, Nolan/F-6933-2011","Holland, Nolan/0000-0002-0752-6887",,,,23,29,29,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,AUG 28,2001.0,34,18,,,,,6424,6430,,10.1021/ma001215w,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,466TN,WOS:000170662100044,,,,,2019-02-25

With regard to the inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants, it was previously found that a crucial precedent event was the spontaneous adsorption and denaturation of fibrinogen on implant surfaces. It was further found that interactions between the phagocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and one short sequence within the fibrinogen D domain (gamma 190-202; P1) at least partially explained phagocyte accumulation on implant surfaces. However, the reason that adsorbed fibrinogen is proinflammatory-while soluble fibrinogen clearly is not-remained obscure. In this study, therefore, the question of how fibrinogen is converted to a proinflammatory state when adsorbed to biomaterial surfaces is investigated. In soluble fibrinogen, the 13 amino acid P1 sequence was found to be hidden. However, the adsorption and denaturation of fibrinogen on the surfaces of commonly used biomaterials lead to the exposure of P1 and a second neo-epitope, gamma 377-395 (P2), which also interacts with Mac-1 and is similarly occult in the soluble protein. The extent of biomaterial-mediated PI and P2 exposure appears directly related to the severity of inflammatory responses to a test panel of biomaterials. Finally, thrombin-mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin also exposes both P1 and P2 epitopes. These observations may help explain both the inflammation caused by many types of implanted biomaterials and that which occurs naturally following thrombotic events.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tang, LP (reprint author), Univ Texas, Biomed Engn Program, Box 19138, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R01-HL56187, R01-HL60787, R01-HL63199]",,,73,252,254,3,62,AMER SOC HEMATOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1900 M STREET.

In order to obtain medical purity, this study prepared membrane-form polyurethanes from toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and poly(propylene ethylene glycol) without the addition of any ingredients such as solvents, catalysts, or chain extenders. The aim was to increase surface hydrophilicity and improve blood compatibility. Therefore, the prepared membranes were modified by treatment with oxygen or argon plasmas. Characterizations of the samples were achieved by contact-angle and water-uptake studies as well as from atomic force microscope (AFM) pictures. It was found that oxygen-modified samples were more hydrophilic than argon-modified samples. The AFM images showed that surface roughness increased with plasma treatment. The protein adsorption experiments carried out with single protein solutions demonstrated that the adsorption of bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen decreased drastically by increasing the applied power and exposure time of the glow discharge. A similar decrease in the adsorption of protein was also observed for human blood proteins. The alterations of the conformational structures of the adsorbed proteins were examined by fluorescence spectrophotometry. Similar spectra with the same maximum wavelength were observed for native and desorbed proteins. These results showed that no denaturation of the proteins occurred upon adsorption on the surfaces of the prepared membranes.

The present study considers this problem when the truss is made of a material with random microstructure, that is, when co is a random field. The trusses tending to the optimal state can be determined through a net of characteristics generalized to a stochastic setting. While in the classical case of a homogeneous material this net gives the minimum weight as its spacing tends to zero, the presence of a random microstructure prevents the attainment of this state. Basically, the finer the net, the stronger the scatter of characteristics, which forces one to use more structural material to compensate for these fluctuations. In effect, there is a limitation to the attainment of the optimality of the Michell truss made of a hypothetical perfectly homogeneous material.","Inst Paper Sci & Technol, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA","Ostoja-Starzewski, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",martin.ostoja@ipst.edu,,"Ostoja-Starzewski, Martin/0000-0002-3493-363X",,,,15,3,3,0,0,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-5021,1471-2946,,P ROY SOC A-MATH PHY,Proc.

Tissue engineering approaches can be categorized into substitutive approaches, where the aim is the ex vivo construction of a living tissue or organ similar to a transplant, vs. histioconductive or histioinductive concepts in vivo. The main successful approaches in developing tissue substitutes to date have been progresses in the understanding of cell-cell interactions, the selection of appropriate matrices (cell-matrix interaction) and chemical signalling (cytokines, growth factors) for stimulation of cell proliferation and migration within a tissue-engineered construct. So far virtually all mammalian cells can be cultured under specific culture conditions and in tissue specific matrices. Future progress in cell biology may permit the use of pluripotent stem cells for TE. The blueprint for tissue differentiation is the genome: for this it is reasonable to combine tissue engineering with gene therapy. The key to the progress of tissue engineering is an understanding between basic scientists, biochemical engineers, clinicians, and industry. Anat Rec 263:372-378, 2001.

Prior to the fractography study, we assessed degradation through FTIR and optical density measurements in microtome sections. Then, we morphologically compared the surface fractography of degraded, oxidized UHMWPE with that of non-degraded material in specimens from the same implants, fractured after uniaxial tensile tests in standardized samples. Fractography surface analysis clearly differentiated the behavior of non-degraded and degraded UHMWPE. Failure in non-degraded samples occurred through craze formation, followed by fast crack propagation. Quantitative fracture analysis suggested a ductile behavior. This was supported by the identified local plasticity in the region close to the initial flaw. In the fractography surface analysis of degraded material, a fibrillar behavior was observed. A heterogeneous domain structure appeared, showing different coarseness with multiple void sizes. Our results, based on mechanical measurements and fracture morphology in the subsurface region, confirmed the embrittlement of oxidized UHMWPE. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This approach involves ozonation and then followed by graft polymerization with acrylates containing PEG, sulfonated PEG or by coupling of PEG derivatives. All the reactions were confirmed by ATR FT-IR and ESCA. The degree of ozonation measured by the iodide method was dependent on the ozone permeability of the polymers used. Surface hydrophilicity was investigated by measuring the contact angles. Ozonation itself yielded a slight increase in hydrophilicity and a decrease in platelet adhesion, but PEG immobilization showed a significant effect on surface hydrophilicity and platelet adhesion to confirm well-known PEG's passivity which minimize the adhesion of blood components on polymer surfaces. Both graft polymerization and coupling were effective for PU. In contrast, only grafting gave enough yields for PMMA and silicone. Platelet adhesion results demonstrated that all PEG modified surfaces adsorbed lower platelet adhesion than untreated or ozonated ones. Polymers coupled with sulfonated PEG exhibited the lowest platelet adhesion when compared with control and PEG coupled ones by virtue of the synergistic effect of non-adhesive PEG and negatively charged SO3 groups. This PEG or sulfonated PEG immobilization technology using ozonation is relatively simple for introducing uniform surface modification and therefore very useful for practical application of blood contacting medical devices.

The role of in vivo salinity, temperature, and protein content as modulators of corrosion product toxicity assessment was investigated empirically and mechanistically. Co-Cr-Mo products were found to be more toxic than those of 316L, and the most toxic ions were Cr6+, Ni2+, and Co2+. Ringer's solution potentiated the toxicity of the more toxic metal ions and reduced the toxicity of the less toxic ions. Using theoretical analysis in conjunction with experimental measurements. the ions in both alloys were found to interact in an antagonistic fashion. The presence of albumin was found to decrease metal toxicity, presumably by chelation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The available implants have different structural characteristics, which may influence orbital response. We studied the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts in vitro after exposure to four different orbital implants. Methods: Four orbital implant biomaterials were studied: hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye), synthetic hydroxyapatite, porous polyethylene (Medpor) (pore sizes 150 mum and 400 mum) and aluminium oxide (Bioceramic implant). Human fibroblasts obtained from orbital fat at the time of elective blepharoplasty were cultured and then exposed to the individual implants. Cell growth was assessed with immunocytochemical analysis using bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue. After DNA denaturation, the cells were washed, incubated with secondary antibody and visualized. Results: The fibroblasts growing on the Bio-Eye, synthetic hydroxyapatite, and 150-mum and 400-mum Medpor implants all had debris associated with them. The Bioceramic implant was free of this debris. The Bioceramic implant and the 150-mum Medpor implant had the greatest number of fibroblasts on the coverslips. Interpretation: The proliferation of fibroblasts, as determined by visualization of actively dividing cells with bromodeoxyuridine, differed on the various implants studied. The lack of debris associated with the Bioceramic implant may be related to the crystalline structure of the implant.","Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Univ Ottawa, Inst Eye, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Mawn, LA (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Med Ctr, 2115 21st Ave S,8000 Med Ctr E, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",louise.mawn@mcmail.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,33,21,23,0,2,CANADIAN OPHTHAL SOC,OTTAWA,"1525 CARLING AVE SUITE 610, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 8R9, CANADA",0008-4182,1715-3360,,CAN J OPHTHALMOL,Can.

Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of application of chitin beads (a bioabsorbable natural polymer) as a bone substitute in bone formation by GTR. The experiment was carried out in 25 rats. The mandibular ramus was exposed on one side after elevation of a muscle-periosteal flap, and a teflon capsule filled with chitin beads (2.0 mm in diameter) was placed with its opening facing the lateral aspect of the ramus. On the contralateral side of the jaw, serving as control, an empty teflon capsule was placed in the same manner. Groups of 5 animals were sacrificed at 7, 15, 30, 60 and 120 days following capsule placement. Histological analysis demonstrated that the amount of newly formed bone was similar in both experimental and control specimens, amounting to approximately 3% of the central/largest, cross-sectional area created by the capsule at 15 days, and to approximately 9% of this area at 30 days following capsule placement. At 60 and 120 days, however, the amount of newly formed bone observed in the control specimens was twice as large as that observed in the test specimens, amounting to approximately 31% of the cross-sectional area created by the capsule at 60 days, and to approximately 45% at 120 days. It is concluded that, although chitin beads (2.0 mm in diameter) are biocompatible, their presence retards bone formation in the model system used.","Univ Aarhus, Fac Hlth Sci, Royal Dent Coll, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Univ Aarhus, Royal Dent Coll, Dept Peridontol & Oral Gerontol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Kostopoulos, L (reprint author), Univ Aarhus, Fac Hlth Sci, Royal Dent Coll, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Bennelyst Blvd, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",,,,,,,38,10,12,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0905-7161,1600-0501,,CLIN ORAL IMPLAN RES,Clin.

The hemocompatibility of the coating compared favorably with that of low temperature isotropic (LTI) carbon, with kinetic clotting time and hemolysis rate approximately the same as for LTI carbon, and platelet consumption about twice that of the latter. The mechanical properties were good, with a microhardness greater than that of the uncoated metal substrates, and high adhesion of >0.75 GPa (interface shear stress) as estimated from a thermal quench method. Glancing-angle X-ray diffraction measurements indicated the presence of a TiC transition layer, suggesting the formation of a Ti/TiC/ta-C multilayer structure, leading in turn to good film-substrate adhesion. We conclude that this kind of amorphous diamond coating could provide benefit as a biocompatible hard coating for Ti-6Al-4V substrate material. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is especially needed to study damage process of the particles at slight movement and lower load for long-term service of implanted materials. The wear and abrasion behavior of particles on Ti-6Al-4V coated with diamond-like carbon (DLC) were appropriately simulated in the present paper by fretting wear and nano-scratch test. The coatings with a thickness of 2.5 mum were deposited with an r.f.-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. The analytic techniques employed to assess DLC coatings characterization include SEM, ATM, Raman and IR spectroscopy. Assessment of hardness, elastic modulus, abrasion and adhesion of the coatings were performed using a Nano Indenter XP system with attachments of continuous stiffness measurements (CSM) and lateral force measurements (LFM). Tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated by a fretting wear test. It was concluded that the DLC coatings had a smooth surface morphology with a rms of 6.8 nm and possessed good adhesion to the substrate, they recovered fully elastic at lower load (60 mN) and were ploughed and delaminated only partially at higher load (400 mN). Nevertheless, there was wear debris concurrently generated during the nano-scratch and fretting test, which was more evident at high loads for a definite coatings, indicating an essential necessity of the work to improve the wear resistant of the coatings to avoid the generation of wear debris. The friction coefficient of DLC coatings against corundum obtained by fretting test decreased with the increase of relative humidity, it was below 0.1 in an aqueous condition, this may be beneficial to their biomedical applications in body fluids.

A new ""cold coating technique"" for metallic implants was established to produce a biodegradable coating with a high mechanical stability that provides a continuous release of incorporated growth factors. The properties of this bioactive coating were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed a coating thickness of in average 14.8 mum on titanium and 10.7 mum on steel wires. Intramedullary implantation and extraction experiments depicted a loss of PDLLA coating from titanium and steel implants of less than 5%, After explantation of the implants, the coating displayed a complete and regular layer without any defects of PDLLA uncovering the metallic surface. Smear tests demonstrate that the coating can be performed under sterile conditions. The PDLLA depicted a reduction of about 8% within 6 weeks in vitro and in vivo. The growth factors were incorporated in a stable form and demonstrated a loss of stability of less than 3% within 42 days and less than 5% within one year. In an elution experiment, 54% IGF-I and 48% TGF-beta1 were released within the first 48 h, After 42 days, 76% of IGF-I and 71% of TGF-beta1 were detected in the elution fluid by ELISA, Comparable results were obtained in the in vive experiments after 42 days.

The surfactants were characterized by FTIR and H-1-NMR spectroscopies for purity and composition. Contact-angle and AFM measurements confirmed full monolayer adsorption for all surfactants on a model surface, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, while full coverage was observed on polyethylene only for PVAm (M7:Hex) due to the optimal M7:I-lex ratio and Hex chain density. On graphite, protein resistance increased with increasing coating thickness from 81.4 to 85.8 to 95.8% for the M2, M7, and M15 surfactants, respectively. Additionally, static platelet adhesion on all three surfactants dropped substantially to 15% (M2), 17% (M7), and 16% (M15) compared to glass (adhesion normalized to 100%) and a polyurethane (24%) surface.

The migration of a tissue sheet was enhanced along the microgrooves, while migration across the microgrooves was inhibited. Changing the depth of the microgrooves had a greater effect on migration than alteration of the groove/ridge width. The migration of epithelial cells from a confluent monolayer culture followed a similar pattern to that of intact epithelial tissue. Cellular extensions generally followed the microgroove direction by tracking along the top of the ridges or following the ridge walls, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Actin filaments within the basal cell layer of the tissue were aligned with the microgrooves, unlike filaments in the superficial layers that did not appear to be affected by the presence of underlying microgrooves. The basal cell layer of the tissue conformed to the contours of the microgroove following migration. However, the ultrastructure of the tissue above the ridges resembled that of tissue on a flat surface. We concluded that surface microgrooves have the potential to direct the migration of immediately adjacent epithelial tissue, the effect of which is to guide epithelial tissue on the surface of implanted biomaterials.

However, by optimizing surfaces for tissue integration it is likely that bacterial adhesion may also be affected, resulting in a greater risk of biomaterial-related infection. This could be detrimental to both the implant and the patient because biomaterial related infections are particularly resistant to host defenses and antibiotics. In this study, we analyzed the adhesion of a Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolate and 3T3 rat fibroblasts to tissue culture plastic coated with varying concentrations of fibronectin (Fn). Bacterial adhesion was always lower than tissue culture plastic and appeared to decrease with increasing Fn concentrations. Mammalian cell adhesion to Fn Exceeded adhesion to tissue culture plastic but did not differ significantly over the range of protein concentrations or between 1 and 4 h of incubation. In most casts, the total surface coverage did not vary with time or Fn concentration, indicating that maximal cell adhesion and spreading occurred rapidly and at low protein concentrations. This study suggests that, by controlling the density of proteins or ligands on a surface, we can potentially optimize mammalian cell adhesion without stimulating bacterial adhesion, hence reducing the likelihood of infection.

The aim of this study was to further enhance the bioactivity of glasses by creating a microroughness on their surface. Microroughness increases potential surface area for cell attachment and biomaterial-cell interactions. Three bioactive glasses of different composition were studied. Each material was flame-sprayed into microspheres, and a selected fraction of the spheres (250-300 mum) was sintered to form porous bioactive glass specimens. To create microrough surfaces, different acid etching techniques were tested. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and back-scattered electron imaging of scanning electron microscopy (BEI-SEM) were used to characterize surface roughness. The degree of roughness was measured by AFM. A novel chemical-etching method, developed through intensive screening of different options, was found consistently to create the desired microroughness, with an average roughness value (R-a) of 0.35-0.52 mum and a root mean-square roughness value (R-rms) of 0.42-0.64 mum. Microroughening of the glass surface was obtained even in the internal parts of the porous glass matrices. Measured by BEI-SEM, the etching of a bioactive glass surface did not interfere with the formation of the characteristic surface reactions of bioactive glasses. This was confirmed by immersing the etched and control glass bodies in a simulated body fluid and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane/HCl. The etching process did not significantly affect the mechanical strength of the sintered bioactive glass structures. Based on these experiments, it stems possible to create a reproducible microroughness of appropriate size on the surface of porous bioactive glass. The biologic benefits of such a surface treatment need to be validated with in vivo experiments. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

However, these veins are unavailable in 30-40% of patients. In such a situation, prosthetic grafts provide the only alternative. Since an endothelial cell (EC) lining, important for maintaining a ""haemostatic-thrombotic"" balance, does not develop onto the intima of implanted grafts in humans, these grafts occlude within a short period of time. The failure of vascular grafts is attributed to their characteristics which are nonconducive towards endothelial cell adhesion, spreading and growth. In order to examine whether the patency of vascular grafts can be improved by the surface modification of grafts' intima, small diameter grafts were modified by a novel ammonia plasma treatment to enhance their interactions with EC. Methods. Through laparotomy, ammonia plasma treated ePTFE (4 nun in diameter) grafts (n=3) and control untreated grafts (n=6) were implanted into the distal infrarenal aorta of rabbits. At appropriate time, grafts and adherent tissue were removed, fixed, stained and embedded in Poly/Bed 812. Light microscopic examination of thin sections cut from the proximal and distal anastomatic and midportion segments of explanted grafts was carried out Results. In control group studies, all animals developed lower limb paraplegia within seven days of implantation. Light microscopic examination of explanted control grafts showed that control grafts were obstructed by thrombosis/intimal hyperplasia. However, ammonia plasma modified explanted grafts, after one month of transplantation, revealed an endothelial cell-like lining that covered the grafts' inner surfaces. Accordingly, these grafts remained patent in animals. Conclusions. The grafts' surfaces that are made conducive to EC adhesion and proliferation and host response may influence endothelial regeneration. it is hoped that the combination of angiogenic molecules (ie. endothelial cell specific growth factors such as VEGF) with ammonia plasma modified grafts may provide further insight into the development of ideal small diameter prosthesis.","McGill Univ, Fac Med, Artificial Cells & Organs Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Sipehia, R (reprint author), McGill Univ, Fac Med, Artificial Cells & Organs Res Ctr, 3655 Drummond, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.",,,,,,,30,9,11,0,3,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0021-9509,,,J CARDIOVASC SURG,J.

In this study, the variation in polymer blend ratio was examined to observe a change in degradation rate. The porous blends were degraded in water and serum-containing media. A previous study examined in vitro degradation in serum-free buffer. Molecular weight loss, gravimetric weight loss, pH changes and morphological changes were evaluated. The changes in porosity were observed with scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively assessed using image analysis. There was a significant difference in molecular weight loss and gravimetric weight loss between the blends after 10 weeks in vitro.

Many types of polymers are used for biomedical purposes; depending on the application, bioresorbable or non-bioresorbable (semi-crystalline or amorphous) polymers are used. Among bioresorbable polymers, we focused on homopolymers and copolymers based on poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid) and poly(epsilon -caprolactone). Being a nondestructive technique, Raman spectroscopy proved particularly suitable for evaluating the molecular structure and crystallinity of bioresorbable polymers and their degradation products. For various biomedical applications, non-degradable semi-crystalline polymers have been widely employed; in this class of polymers, we concentrated on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) used in orthopaedic implants (total hip and knee joints). Vibrational spectroscopy appeared particularly suitable in studying the oxidation and crystallinity of UHMWPE.

In vitro studies of different bone cements containing antibiotics, developed for the prevention of biomaterial-associated infection, could not always demonstrate complete eradication of biomaterial-adherent bacteria. We have investigated four different bone cements in regard to bacterial accumulation of a slime-producing strain RP 62 A and its isogenic mutant M7 lacking the ability to produce exopolysaccharide slime using a bacterial adhesion assay and modified Kirby-Bauer technique. A significant effect of exopolysaccharide production for the accumulation on bone cement could be demonstrated.

Specific attention is paid to recent investigations focusing on the synthesis of semipermeable amphiphilic networks designed to be used as immunoisolatory membranes. The membranes envelop insulin-producing living pig beta cells. They are biocompatible to the host (human) and the guest (beta cells) and remain permeable for many months in vivo. They are rubbery slippery, robust, sterilizable, optically transparent, with controlled pore dimensions that allow the in-diffusion of glucose and nutrients, out-diffusion of insulin and wastes, but they do not allow the entry of immunoproteins (IgG). The pores remain permeable for many months in vivo. The membranes are made by copolymerizig/crosslinking hydrophilic (meth)acrylates with methacrylate-telechelic polyisobutylenes. Controlling the molecular weights of the constituent segments controls the pore sizes of the membranes. Immunoisolated pig beta cells enveloped in our membranes and implanted subcutaneously in a rat have corrected severe hyperglycemia.","Univ Akron, Dept Polymer Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Kennedy, JP (reprint author), Univ Akron, Dept Polymer Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",,,,,,,25,20,21,0,9,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1022-1360,1521-3900,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

Improved metal alloys, special polymers, and medical grade ceramics are the basis for this success, which has enhanced the quality of life for millions of patients. However, an increasing percentage of our aging population require greater than 30 years survivability of the devices. It is proposed that to satisfy this growing need for very long term orthopaedic repair a paradigm shift is needed; a shift in emphasis from the replacement of tissues to the regeneration of tissues. Such a shift from a materials and mechanics approach to tissue repair requires an increase in the understanding and utilisation of biologically approaches. Two new biologically orientated alternatives in biomaterials for orthopaedics in the new millennium are discussed: tissue regeneration, where in situ repair is initiated in the host tissue, and tissue engineering, where repair is initiated in vitro on cellularly seeded scaffolds and then transplanted to the recipient. The concept of the use of class A bioactive materials to stimulate the regeneration of trabecular bone is described along with clinical applications. Eleven reaction stages lead to the enhanced proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and the recreation of trabecular bone architecture. Recent results showing the effects of microchemical gradients on the genetic activation of bone cells are related to the molecular design of hierarchical bioactive resorbable scaffolds for the tissue engineering of bone constructs.

Three kinds of alkaline compounds, such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, and lithium hydroxide, were used for treatment. Only magnesium treated with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution gave a good corrosion resistance in HBSS solution at 25 degreesC up to 75 days, while almost no effect in sodium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. It was likely that hydrogen carbonate ions were essential for the surface improvement of magnesium. X-ray diffraction patterns of modified magnesium showed now peaks of magnesium carbonate and others on the surface. New surface structure of needle-shaped crystals was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Both elemental mapping, and energy dispersive (EDX) techniques in SEM showed the precipitation of calcium magnesium phosphate (low crystallinity whitlockite:(Ca,Mg)(3)(PO4)(2)) on the surface of magnesium specimen.

The properties of the solvents used in these processes are critical for surface formation in these polymers.

Rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were culture-expanded and separately stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) for chondrogenic differentiation or with an osteogenic supplement (OS). MSCs exposed to TGF-beta1 were loaded into a sponge composed of a hyaluronan derivative (HYAF(R)-11) for the construction of the cartilage component of the composite graft, and MSCs exposed to OS were loaded into a porous calcium phosphate ceramic component for bone formation. Cell-loaded HYAFF(R)-11 sponge and ceramic were joined together with fibrin sealant, Tisseel(R), to form a composite osteochondral graft, which was then implanted into a subcutaneous pocket in syngeneic rats. Specimens were harvested at 3 and 6 weeks after implantation, examined with histology for morphologic features, and stained immunohistochemically for type I, II, and X collagen. The two-component composite graft remained as an integrated unit after in vivo implantation and histologic processing. Fibrocartilage was observed in the sponge, and bone was detected in the ceramic component. Observations with polarized light indicated continuity of collagen fibers between the ceramic and HYAFF(R)-11 components in the 6-week specimens. Type I collagen was identified in the neo-tissue in both sponge and ceramic, and type II collagen in the fibrocartilage, especially the pericellular matrix of cells in the sponge. These data suggest that the construction of a tissue-engineered composite osteochondral graft is possible with MSCs and different biomaterials and bioactive factors that support either chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Univ Hosp Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Caplan, AI (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, 2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,"Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,41,189,211,1,17,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,AUG,2001.0,7,4,,,,,363,371,,10.1089/10763270152436427,,,,9,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,459EL,WOS:000170238000001,11506726.0,,,,2019-02-25

We implemented SIP onto a COOH-terminated SAM on gold using a sequential approach to couple an amine-terminated free radical initiator to the terminal COOH groups presented by the SAM, followed by free radical polymerization of styrene. Each step of SIP was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry, and the PS film and micropattern were also characterized by atomic force microscopy. We typically obtained PS films with a thickness of 10-20 nm for a polymerization time of 12-24 h and with a root-mean-square roughness of less than or equal to 50.5 nm. PS micropatterns were also successfully fabricated by reactive mu CP of the initiator onto a COOH-terminated SAM, followed by SIP of styrene. We also demonstrate two potential applications of SIP in biomaterials research: (1) label-free, real-time monitoring of protein adsorption on polymers by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on nanometer thick homogeneous polymer films fabricated on a SAM on gold and (2) patterning cells on micropatterned polymers fabricated by combining mu CP and SIP.","Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Chilkoti, A (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Box 90281, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,,,,,,82,75,76,2,29,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 31,2001.0,34,16,,,,,5644,5652,,10.1021/ma002125u,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,457TD,WOS:000170152200042,,,,,2019-02-25

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is a powerful method for the characterization of adsorbed proteins on biomaterial surfaces due to its chemical specificity and surface sensitivity. However, the SIMS fragmentation patterns for proteins are quite complex due to the heterogeneity of the protein sequence; Therefore, the multivariate analysis technique principal components analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a more detailed interpretation of the protein SIMS spectra. This study utilizes single component adsorbed protein films on three model substrates and multivariate analysis of the ToF-SIMS data to determine the identity of protein films. Furthermore, ToF-SIMS and PCA were used to give insight into the composition of a 1% bovine plasma protein film. The single component spectra from 13 different proteins were readily distinguishable using PCA. The major component of the 1% bovine plasma film was found to shift from fibrinogen to gamma -globulins over the course of 2 h, in agreement with the current literature. This study shows how combination of ToF-SIMS and PCA provides new insights into the composition of adsorbed protein films on biomaterial surfaces.","Univ Washington, Natl ESCA & Surface Anal Ctr Biomed Problems, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Natl ESCA & Surface Anal Ctr Biomed Problems, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Castner, DG (reprint author), Univ Washington, Natl ESCA & Surface Anal Ctr Biomed Problems, Dept Chem Engn, Box 351750, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,,,,76,304,305,4,83,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,JUL 24,2001.0,17,15,,,,,4649,4660,,10.1021/la001209t,,,,12,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,455LX,WOS:000170029300031,,,,,2019-02-25

To determine the influence of surface-charge and -adsorbed adhesion proteins on this signaling pathway, paxillin phosphorylation was examined during attachment of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cell onto charged and uncharged polystyrene, and on ad-sorbed layers of serum proteins, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), a mixture of Fn and Vn, and albumin, Paxillin phosphorylation was induced 2.4-fold (P < 0.05) on charged vs uncharged polystyrene only in the presence of serum proteins. Activation of paxillin via Fn or Vn alone, or in combination, resulted in significantly lower phosphorylation signals compared to whole serum (41 +/- 6.9%, P < 0.05, 45 +/- 5.9%, P < 0.05, and 76 +/- 9.8%, P < 0.075, respectively), Confocal laser microscopy confirmed increased co-localization of phosphotyrosine and paxillin at protruding lamellopodia of spreading osteoblasts on charged vs uncharged serum-pretreated polystyrene, Taken together, these data suggest that subtle differences in surface characteristics mediate effects on adhering cells via adsorbed serum proteins involving the cytoskeletal adaptor protein paxillin.

The elastics tested were from 2 manufacturers (GAC and Masel) and made of 2 materials (latex and non-latex). The properties tested included cross-sectional area, breaking force, peak load, peak stress, stiffness, modulus, hysteresis, and 24-hour load relaxation. The data were analyzed with 1-sample t tests, an analysis of variance, and the Fisher PLSD test. Between GAC and Masel, the GAC non-latex elastics had greater breaking forces than did the Masel non-latex elastics. The Masel latex elastics had greater breaking forces than did the Masel non-latex elastics. The GAC non-latex elastics showed more viscoelastic properties than both the GAC latex elastics and the Masel non-latex elastics; however, the Masel elastics were more viscoelastic than the GAC elastics. Forces generated by the elastics decreased over 24 hours to an average load approximating 75% of the manufacturers' values (GAC latex, Masel latex, and Masel non-latex elastics) and to 60% for the GAC non-latex elastics. The mechanical properties of the non-latex elastics were not comparable to those of the latex elastics. Therefore, the clinical choice of elastics should be based on the patient's medical history and the specific mechanical properties of the type of elastic.","Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Orthodont, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; IWK Grace Hlth Ctr, Div Orthodont, Halifax, NS, Canada; Sch Biomed Engn, Halifax, NS, Canada","Russell, KA (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Orthodont, Room 5164,5981 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",,,,,,,23,26,29,0,3,"MOSBY, INC",ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",0889-5406,,,AM J ORTHOD DENTOFAC,Am.

Thus, understanding the factors influencing the interactions of fibrinogen with biomaterials, and how platelet responses are affected, is crucial for the development of synthetic materials exhibiting improved blood compatibility. In this study, the effects of fibrinogen residence time and shear rate on the procoagulant activity of adherent platelets, along with their morphologic status, as deduced from scanning electron microscopy, were investigated. To examine whether adherent platelets promoted the generation of thrombin, polymeric materials (polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, and silicone rubber) preadsorbed with fibrinogen were exposed to platelet suspensions at different wall shear rates and then incubated with clotting factors for 5 minutes under static conditions. The amount of thrombin generated per platelet was calculated from the optical density of the color developed by adding substrate S-2238. Scanning electron microscopy images of the platelets revealed that the platelets exhibited different morphologies, depending on the shear rate and residence time of the adsorbed fibrinogen, Platelets ranged from their normal discoid shape observed primarily under static conditions, to that of fully spread platelets. Results from this study show that platelets, in the presence of shear forces, undergo activation on exposure to surfaces on which adsorbed fibrinogen has resided for short residence times rather than long residence times. Interestingly, studies examining the procoagulant responses of such adherent platelets demonstrated that the platelets attached to the fibrinogen coated materials did not promote significant thrombin generation. Such low prothrombinase activity of adherent platelets suggests that adsorbed fibrinogen, while capable of supporting platelet adhesion and spreading on biomaterials, does not necessarily enhance the procoagulant activity of adherent platelets.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN USA","Balasubramanian, V (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Div Thrombosis Res, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1269, New York, NY 10029 USA.",,,,,,,19,8,10,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-AUG,2001.0,47,4,,,,,354,360,,10.1097/00002480-200107000-00012,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,451XE,WOS:000169827200012,11482486.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Collision processes between two cloud particles could be treated as composed of three phases: before contact, contact and withdrawal. Interfacial mass and charge transfer between proximal and contacting water or ice surfaces depends on the balance of competing intermolecular interactions at the interfaces. This paper attempts to demonstrate how the Free Energy Reduction by Molecular Interface Crossing (FERMIC) model could be complementarily applied and fully implemented into existing concepts to interpret complex atmospheric charge transfer processes, offering a novel qualitative physical explanation to the experimental results of charge separation in thunderclouds assumed to occur before contact. The FERMIC process has been extensively applied to the understanding of the transfer of mass or charge across liquid interfaces, self-organized molecular assembly in physical and biological processes and in the development of biomaterials. However, it was never used to explain the interfacial mass and charge transfer processes occurring during collisions of hydrometeors in thunderclouds where strong electrification and lightning are common.

The major biological concerns include local cell and tissue necrosis due to the polymerization exotherm and low conversions at greater depths due to light attenuation through thick samples. Experimental results indicate that depth of cure and temperature rises are controllable by altering the photoinitiator concentration, initiating light intensity, and type of photoinitiator. For example, no measurable conversion was detected at a 1.0 cm depth when polymerization was initiated with 1.0wt% DMPA and 100mW/cm(2) ultraviolet light, whereas similar to 40% conversion was obtained when the initiator concentration was lowered to 0.1 wt%. This conversion was further increased to similar to 55% when a photobleaching initiator system was employed. At the highest rate of initiation studied (i.e., 1.0 wt% DMPA irradiated with 100 mW/cm(2) ultraviolet light), a maximum temperature of similar to 49 degreesC was reached at the sample surface; however, this temperature dramatically decreased to similar to 33 degreesC when the light intensity was decreased to 25 mW/cm(2). Finally, dual initiating systems that synergistically combine the advantages of photoinitiation and thermal initiation were investigated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In our study, the comet test did not detect a significant difference in genotoxicity between the pure elastomer and the same elastomer containing 0.01mg/ml 4-nitroquinoline oxide, but did detect a significant difference between two elastomers containing 0.01 and 0.3mg/ml of 4-nitroquinoline oxide, respectively Since, the surface properties of the samples were identical, only the chemical composition may have caused significant differences in mutagenicity.

Their stability was investigated by incubations in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solutions. The enzymatic clot degradation was induced through addition of human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to the plasma and the surface protein remnants after the degradation were analyzed with polyclonal antibodies. The results show that the plasma films were not SDS resistant on hydrophilic silicon. However, stability was obtained after preparation on hydrophobic silicon or when albumin or fibrinogen was immobilized to silicon before the plasma incubations.

This study was designed to explore the in vitro effects of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se) on polypropylene (PL) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prostheses. Fragments of PL and ePTFE were placed in a medium previously inoculated with Sa, Sr or Sa + Se (1 x 10(8) cfu Sa or/and Se). Bacterial effects on the biomaterials were evaluated for 30 days through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to confirm the presence of bacteria on the prostheses, specimens were Gram stained and challenged with an antibody against protein-a (a specific Sa bacterial wall component). In both methods, specimens were examined by light microscopy. The presence of bacteria as microcolonies or biofilms was detected at PL filament cross-over regions after 30 days. Bacterial colonization of the ePTFE fragments was observed in internodal areas, which led to the deformation of prosthetic filaments. The present findings indicate that Sa and Se colonize the cross-over regions of the PL filaments, whereas in ePTFE prostheses. it is the internodal areas which are mostly affected. The latter areas are of difficult access to defence agents. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For the in vitro analysis cell culture methods were used. The in vivo tissue reactions were evaluated in an intramuscular acid intracortical bone implantation model on goats, using light and scanning electron microscopy. A computerized image analysis system was used to obtain histomorphometric data regarding bone contact and remodelling after 6 and 12 weeks of implantation. In both in vitro and in vivo models, the SEVA-C-based materials did not induce adverse reactions, which in addition to their bone-matching mechanical properties makes them promising materials for bone replacement/fixation.

Initial adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH2 102, Escherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 to these surfaces was measured in a parallel plate flow chamber in phosphate-buffered saline. Adhering bacteria were allowed to multiply by perfusing the flow chamber with growth medium. All bacteria adhered most rapidly to the positively charged surface, but there was no subsequent surface growth of the Gram-negative strains. On the negatively charged surfaces, despite a slower initial adhesion, surface growth of the adhering bacteria was exponential for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains.

The aim of this study is to evaluate a highly sensitive technique for detecting changes at the mRNA level in circulating monocytes and to find suitable ""gene markers"" for assessing the hemocompatibility of biomaterials. Human blood was recirculated in a modified Chandler Loop formed of test tubes. Five groups of biomaterials were compared. Monocytes were separated by using magnetic beads, and gene expression analyses were performed using RT-PCR. We investigated the mRNA expression of stress proteins (hsp70) and inflammatory markers (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). mRNAs for cytokines were highly upregulated in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Hsp70 transcripts were upregulated after heat shock but were not influenced by treatment with LPS. The gene expression of the cytokines was affected by various biomaterials. The intensity of the inflammatory response increased in the following order: heparin coatings (PVC) < uncoated PVC < silicone, polypeptide-coated PVC. No change was seen in the expression of the hsp70 genes. An inhibitory effect of systemic heparin on surface-activated monocytes was observed for the mRNA expression of the cytokines. The recirculation of human blood in an in vitro model in combination with the immunomagnetic separation of monocytes and the Duplex RT-PCR method is a powerful tool for getting reliable results. Our data demonstrate that hsp70 genes cannot be recommended for short-term, biomaterial-induced mRNA expression studies. Conversely, mRNAs for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were expressed in a material-dependent manner. Thus om model provides an effective tool for assessing the hemocompatibility of biomaterials before their clinical application and it also can serve as a safety control during the industrial manufacturing process. This method can be applied to various blood cell populations and numerous gene expression studies and may enable a more fundamental understanding of the biologic processes involved in blood-material interactions.

Using standard cytotoxicity tests, the present study evaluated the biocompatibility of these fibers with cultured bovine tendon fibroblasts. Primary fibroblasts obtained from calf digital extensor tendons were exposed to NDGA, reaction products generated from the polymerization protocol, and the crosslinked fibers. NDGA was cytotoxic to these cells at concentrations above 100 muM NDGA oxidation products were similarly cytotoxic. At concentrations below 100 muM, fibroblast viability was not affected by NDGA or its oxidation products. At these lower concentrations, fibroblast proliferation was unaffected compared to controls not exposed to NDGA. Fibers crosslinked with NDGA contained no unreacted NDGA, but they did contain soluble reaction products that were cytotoxic to tendon fibroblasts in both the elution and the direct contact tests. Washing the fibers in 70% ethanol and phosphate-buffered saline eliminated cytotoxicity of the fibers. Ethanol simultaneously sterilized the fibers. Tensile tests established that the ethanol/phosphate buffer wash did not adversely affect the material properties of the fibers. The results of these experiments indicate that NDGA-crosslinked fibers can be rendered nontoxic to tendon fibroblasts and may provide a novel approach for producing biologically based, biocompatible, tendon bioprostheses.

The present study evaluated the biocompatibility of these fibers with cultured bovine tendon fibroblasts. Fibroblast attachment, migration, and proliferation on NDGA-crosslinked materials were compared to those on prepolymerized type I tendon collagen constructs as well as on tissue-culture-treated plastic. Fibroblast attachment on NDGA-crosslinked collagen fibrils was equivalent to attachment on plates coated with collagen alone. Over a period of 8 days in culture, attached fibroblasts proliferated on NDGA-crosslinked collagen at a rate identical to that of fibroblasts attached to native collagen, in order for the biomaterial effectively to bridge gaps in fibrous tissues, fibroblasts must be able to migrate and replicate on the bridging fiber. Control and crosslinked fibers were inserted in calf tendon explants, with a portion of the fiber extending out of the sectioned end of the tendon. Explants were cultured for 9 weeks, and the number of cells was measured at weekly intervals. Cells appeared on the fibers after 1 week of culture. By 2 weeks, cells had colonized the entire fiber. The number of cells continued to increase throughout the 9 weeks in culture, forming a layer several cells thick. Histologic analysis indicated that the fibroblasts populating the fibers appeared to originate in the epitenon. There was no difference in the rate of fibroblast migration and replication, nor in the ultimate number of colonizing cells, between control collagen fibers and NDGA-crosslinked fibers. NDGA-crosslinked fibers may provide a means of bridging gaps in ruptured, lacerated, or surgically transected tendons by providing a mechanically competent scaffold on which tendon fibroblasts can migrate, attach, and proliferate.

The purpose of the present study was to introduce additional crosslinks and provide evidence that crosslink density may be an underlying inhibitory principle. Entire aortic roots were chosen to verify the concept on the challenging aortic wall tissue. Porcine aortic roots were crosslinked with 0.2% GA, 3%GA, and 3% GA containing an interim step that introduced diamine bridges. Crosslink efficiency was determined on the basis of shrinkage temperature (SrT degrees), resistance to protease digestion (RPD), residual amine analysis (RA), and tensile modulus (E,,,). Calcium levels, calcification patterns, and inflammation were assessed after 6 and 24 weeks of implantation in a sheep circulatory model. Crosslink efficiency in aortic wail tissue was moderately affected by increasing the fixative concentration from 0.2% GA to 3% GA (SrT degrees from 85.7 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees to 87.5 degrees +/- 0.3 degreesC, p < 0.002; RPD from 24.2 +/- 1.2 to 29.1 +/- 0.7%, p < 0.003; RA from 0.069 +/- 0.004 to 0.058 +/- 0.003 mu mol/mg, p < 0.03, and E-10, from 1.9 +/- 0.11 to 2.94 +/- 0.34 MPa, p < 0.01), but it was distinctly enhanced when diamine bridges were introduced (SrT degrees from 87.5 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees to 93.4 degrees +/- 0.3 degreesC, p much less than 0.0001; RPD from 29.1 +/- 0.7 to 68.4 +/- 1.8%, p much less than 0.0001; and E-10 from 2.94 +/- 0.34 to 6.80 +/- 0.61 MPa, p < 0.0003). Aortic wall calcification was reduced significantly by increasing the GA concentration from 0.2 to 3% [37.8%, p = 0.076 (6 weeks) and 34.0%, p = 0.008 (24 weeks)] and further reduced by the introduction of additional diamine [84.0%, p = 0.006 (6 weeks) and 29.8%, p = 0.037 (24 weeks)]. The combined effect of increased GA concentration plus an interim diamine step on aortic wall tissue resulted in a 90% and 53.7% reduction of calcification after 6 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. The correlation coefficients between calcification and SrT degrees, RDP, and E-10 was -0.9767, -0.9460, and -0.9740, respectively (6 weeks). The inflammatory host reaction regularly found in 0.2%; fixed tissue was practically abolished through the introduction of diamine bridges. Our study demonstrated a distinct correlation between the mitigation of aortic wall calcification and three parameters used to assess crosslink density.

Layered constructs have been fabricated from chemically and mechanically cleaned porcine intestinal collagen using ethyl-3(3dimethylamino) propyl carbodiimide (EDC) and an acetone solvent. By varying the concentration of the crosslinker from 1 to 10 mM and the solvent from 0 to 90% acetone, the strength, stiffness, maximum strain, thermal stability, lamination strength, and suture retention strength can be adjusted. These parameters have either functional importance or the potential to modify the remodeling kinetics, or they have both. This study investigates the interdependence of these parameters, the specific effects that variations in concentration can achieve, and how the two crosslinking variables interact. The results demonstrate that there is substantial latitude in the design of these constructs by these straightforward crosslinking modifications. These data provide the basis for studying the in vivo response to crosslinking conditions that will supply the requisite strength while still allowing host cell infiltration and remodeling.

Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages cultured on the hydrogel showed a comparable expression of activation markers CD11b/CD18, CD45, and CD14 to the control. Semiquantitative RT-PCR results showed an absence of upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha in these macrophages with respect to the controls. Primary human respiratory epithelial cells cultured on the hydrogel showed proper attachment, normal morphology, and growth. A small proportion of cells on the hydrogel showed synchronously beating cilia. RT-PCR analysis showed that cells on the hydrogel expressed mucins 2 and 5 and cytokeratin 13, which are markers for secretory goblet and squamous cells, respectively. All these results demonstrate that the hydrogel supports the growth of a mixed population of differentiated epithelial cells. This hydrogel is suitable as a culture substratum for respiratory epithelial cells and could be used as a potential candidate for coating tracheal prostheses.

Porous ceramic implants of alpha -TCP, of glass-ceramic, and of solid composite implants of glass-ceramic/polylactic acid 8 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were fabricated and implanted pressfit into biparietal, full-thickness defects of the calvaria of 60 adult rats. Twenty rats received unfilled defects and served as controls. Fluorochrome labeling of bone formation was performed during the observation period. Five animals from each group were evaluated after 6, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. The control defects showed incomplete regeneration, with bone formation extending 1.66 mm, on average, into the defect after 52 weeks. In the group of alpha -TCP implants, histologic evaluation indicated that the bone formed during initial stages had undergone resorption Later on, so that bone repair after 52 weeks was not significantly enhanced, with an average depth of 1.83 mm of bone ingrowth. The glass-ceramic implants exhibited extensive bone formation and nearly complete repair of the calvarial defect, with 3.90 mm of bone ingrowth into the implant pores. Degradation of the ceramic was nearly complete, with a few remaining particles surrounded by soft tissue. The composite implants showed a negligible bone ingrowth of 0.63 mm, on average. Soft tissue had invaded the polylactic acid implant body, but no bone formation had taken place at the surface of the embedded ceramic particles. Degradation of the polymer was not complete after 52 weeks. It is concluded that the balance between degradation and bone formation is delicate and that chemical events and cellular reaction during degradation may counteract complementary bone ingrowth.

Setting: Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India; Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices, Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Methods. This study comprised 278 eyes of 263 patients having ECCE and 318 eyes of 297 patients having phacoemulsification with PC IOL implantation. Posterior capsule opacification leading to a decrease in Snellen visual acuity of 2 or more lines was considered visually significant. The presence of PCO and IOL haptic fixation were evaluated postoperatively using slitlamp biomicroscopy. Haptic position was noted as in-the-bag (B-B), 1 haptic in the bag and 1 in the sulcus (bag-sulcus [B-S]), or both haptics out of the bag (sulcus-sulcus [S-S]). In addition, the rate of visually significant PCO was compared among 3 IOL biomaterials: poly(methyl methacrylate), silicone, and hydrophobic acrylic. Results: Visually significant PCO occurred in 42.45% of eyes having ECCE and 19.18% of eyes having phacoemulsification (P < .001, chi-square test) after a mean follow-up of 2.4 years +/- 0.7 (SID). In both groups, visually significant PCO was significantly less in eyes with B-B fixation than in those with B-S or S-S fixation (P < .001). The rate of visually significant PCO in all eyes in the phacoemulsification group with B-B fixation was low (11.90%) and was significantly lower in eyes with a hydrophobic acrylic IOL (2.22%; P < .05, chi-square test). Conclusions. In-the-bag PC IOL fixation is required to consistently reduce the incidence of PCO. Thorough removal of lens substance, including hydrodissection-assisted cortical cleanup, and in-the-bag PC IOL fixation seem to be the most important factors in reducing PCO, regardless of surgical procedure or IOL type used. Intraocular lens biomaterial and design also help prevent PCO.

Distraction osteogenesis was performed using an external fixation device. The osteotomy site was surrounded by an external callus, consisting of hyaline cartilage, that contained a large quantity of chondroid bone. Transplanted bone within chondroid bone was characterized by bone formation and remodelling 30 days post-transplantation, and bone adhesion following chondroid bone grafting was better than adhesion following fibula grafting.

These organisms, which are among the most prevalent bacteria of the human skin and mucous membrane microflora, present unique problems in the diagnosis and treatment of infections involving biofilm formation on implanted biomaterials. Epidemiological data that address whether invasive S. epidermidis strains can be traced to commensal organisms or an endemic occurrence of distinct strains with enhanced virulence have important implications for the implementation of appropriate infection control measures. An extracellular polysaccharide adhesin represents a key virulence determinant in S. epidermidis and is required for biofilm formation, Production of this adhesin, which is encoded by the ica operon, is subject to phase variable regulation (ON <----> OFF switching). Recent advances in understanding the molecular events controlling polysaccharide adhesin synthesis and the potential clinical implications of its phase variable regulation are outlined. Further research in this area may contribute to the development of novel strategies for therapeutic intervention. Finally, in addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, preventive strategies to control S, epidermidis medical device-related infections are focusing on the development of improved biomaterials and physical electrical barriers to impede bacterial colonisation.","Beaumont Hosp, Royal Coll Surg Ireland, Dept Clin Microbiol, Educ & Res Ctr, Dublin 9, Ireland","O'Gara, JP (reprint author), Beaumont Hosp, Royal Coll Surg Ireland, Dept Clin Microbiol, Educ & Res Ctr, Smurfit Bldg, Dublin 9, Ireland.",jogara@rcsi.ie,"Humphreys, Hilary/C-9918-2012","O'Gara, James/0000-0003-3866-7161",,,,71,222,228,0,25,MICROBIOLOGY SOC,LONDON,"CHARLES DARWIN HOUSE, 12 ROGER ST, LONDON WC1N 2JU, ERKS, ENGLAND",0022-2615,1473-5644,,J MED MICROBIOL,J.

Bilateral craniotomy was followed by subdural implantation of each hemostatic device. A sham control group was treated in a similar way except that no material was implanted. Implantation of these hemostatic devices for 15, 43, or 92 days did not result in any deaths or clinical neurobehavioral abnormalities, changes in cerebrospinal fluid, or significant macroscopic observations at necropsy. The tissue reaction to SURGIFOAM (TM) sponge was characterized by transient granulomatous inflammation that was slightly less intense than that observed for GELFOAM((R)) sponge which correlated to slightly longer absorption. In contrast, the tissue reaction to Avitene((R)) hemostat was characterized by moderate to marked granulomatous inflammation with an acute inflammatory component indicating a greater degree of tissue irritancy. Sequelae of this reaction were still observed at 92 days post-implantation. The tissue reaction in humans to SURGIFOAM (TM) sponge used as a hemostatic agent for neurologic surgical procedures is expected to be comparable to that observed with CELFOAM((R)) sponge, resulting in no significant adverse reactions for patients. This animal model was useful to assess the tissue reaction and absorption of biomaterials implanted in contact with the central nervous system, and it was able to differentiate between materials of biologic origin.","Ethicon Inc, Div Res & Dev, Somerville, NJ USA; ClinTrials BioRes Ltd, Senneville, PQ, Canada","Barbolt, TA (reprint author), POB 151,Route 22 West, Somerville, NJ 08876 USA.",tbarbolt@ethus.jnj.com,,,,,,12,22,23,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0161-6412,1743-1328,,NEUROL RES,Neurol.

A foldable intraocular lens (IOL) is more expensive than an equivalent rigid IOL. However, surgical and post-operative costs may make a foldable IOL economically preferable. We compared the economic costs of cataract surgery plus implantation of a foldable IOL with implantation of a rigid IOL. Prospective audit of the clinical records of 82 pseudophakes; 39 implanted with a rigid IOL and 43 implanted with a foldable IOL by one surgeon. Average follow-up periods were 25 +/- 7 months and 23 +/- 5 months respectively. There was no difference between the two groups for the follow-up period (P = 0.55), number of post-operative complications (P = 0.25) or cost of post-operative visits (P = 0.83). The cost of single-use theatre equipment was greater for the rigid-IOL group (P = 0.0001). The total identified cost per patient was greater for the foldable-IOL group (P = 0.0001), Despite possible technical advantages, implantation of the foldable IOL did not provide an economic benefit, either in the initial cost or in the costs of post-operative care. Over the 2-year period, implanting with the rigid IOL cost, on average, pound 57 less per patient. Despite this economic difference, a cost-benefit analysis is required, since other factors may be more important. (C) 2001 The College of Optometrists. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The piezoelectric strain tenser element d(14), the elastic constant S-55, and the dielectric permittivity epsilon (11) were measured for collagen films. it was observed that the collagen samples submitted to different pH treatment lead to different electrical behavior. For sample S2. (pH = 5.2) one has a higher denaturation temperature (T-d = 80.55 degreesC), lowest density (rho = 909.6 kg m(-3)), highest dielectric function, lowest frequency constant product (f x L = 320.33 kHz.m) and higher piezoelectricity (d(14) = 0.122 pC/N) which is our major interest in this study. The loss factor Q(-1) measured for all the samples shows that for all the electrodes dimensions sample S2 present the highest loss factor which is between 0.68 and 0.76. We believe that the different pH treatment is critical to the final level of organization of the microscopic structure of the sample. which could result in an increase of the piezoelectricity.

The alloys investigated were Ti-7Nb-6Al, Ti-13Nb-13Zr and Ti-15Zr-4Nb. The results show a large surface enrichment in Al oxides and Zr oxides, respectively, which indicates a considerable outwards diffusion of these two elements. However, an analysis of the Nb 3d spectra reveals that the formation of Nb oxides at the surface is less favoured than in the case of the other alloying elements. The XPS data show for all three Ti alloys a passive layer formed by a mixture of Ti. Al or Zr and Nb oxides. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relevance of size and chemical composition of biomaterial particles on the pattern of particle distribution in host tissues. Adult female B6C3F1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles (size 1.4 and 6.4 mu in diameter) and polystyrene (PS) particles (size 1.2, 5.2, and 12.5 mu in diameter), and euthanized 1, 7 and 28 days later. Peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were collected and the number of cells and percentage of actively phagocytic cells was determined. Macroscopic examination of the tissues in the peritoneal cavity peritoneum revealed visible accumulations of the colored PS particles in the adipose tissues adjacent to the spleen and pancreas, and caudal to the stomach. Distribution of the FS particles appeared similar regardless of the particle size. The location of PMMA particles, which were not colored, could not be distinguished from host tissue and could not be observed in this manner. Intensive phagocytosis of the small and medium sized particles by peritoneal macrophages was observed on day 1, and was diminishing by day 7 after injection. The largest PS particles (12.5 CL) were not engulfed bp the peritoneal macrophages. Histological examination of the spleen, lymph nodes, and the adjacent adipose tissues revealed a marked difference in the deposition patterns of the two polymers used. PS particles, regardless of size, were accumulated primarily in the white adipose tissues adjacent to the spleen and pancreas gland, but very few particles were observed in the splenic tissue. On the other hand, mice injected with PMMA particles of either size had enlarged and activated spleens with marked deposits of particles in the red pulp. These results indicate that these PS and PMMA particles induce different patterns and intensities of the host response. The chemical makeup of the particle is more important in the distribution pattern than is the size of the particle.

In the presence of biomaterial wear particles, host monocytes/macrophages are activated to synthesize or secrete mediators of inflammation. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the host response to particulates and device-associated infections, we have focused on the effects of medical device particles on macrophage function, because these cells play a pivotal role in the body's response to foreign bodies and their interaction with other cellular components of the immune system. In order to evaluate the effects of particles of medical device materials on functional activities of macrophages, we developed a cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) assay system using J774A.1 macrophages. Constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-I) is present in cells under physiological conditions, whereas inducible COX-II is induced by some cytokines, mitogens, and endotoxin, presumably in pathological conditions such as inflammation. We have evaluated the inductive effects of implant materials, i.e., particles of poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA), hydroxyapatite (HA), titanium oxide, and silica, on the activity of COX-II using thin layer chromatography of prostaglandin D, (PGD,) formed from [1-C-14]-labeled arachidonic acid (AA). Also, we have assessed the synergistic effects of these particles on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage activation. Addition of LPS to these particles increased PGD, production severalfold greater than the addition of any inducer alone. Our results indicated that device-associated infections could enhance inflammatory responses to the wear particles in subjects with medical implants or in whom particulate biomaterials are used for clinical purposes. The use of this model COX-II assay system may lead to the identification of inflammatory potentials for implant materials more specifically than present in vivo assays.

The need for alternative medical solutions has not only extended the requirement for biomedical devices to offer more than just functionality but also bioactivity. A new generation of bioactive materials has emerged promising better properties over existing biomaterials because of their ability-to promote intimate bone growth and rapid fixation. In particular, hydroxyapatite (HA) has been recognised as one bioactive material having the potential and opportunity for development as bone substitutes. Although HA has a similar chemical composition to that of natural bone, it lacks sufficient strength and toughness for use in load bearing applications. Very often it requires blending with a low modulus polymer to achieve adequate toughness. However, the properties of HA composites is highly dependent on the particle size and morphology of the HA filler. Much has been suggested on the benefit of nano particulate materials in achieving higher mechanical properties. The need now arises in developing and processing HA of sufficient fineness for this purpose. As such the synthesis of ultra-fine HA was initiated using RF induction suspension plasma spraying with a wet suspension of HA as feedstock. This was axially injected into the RF plasma at various plate powers (plasma energies), chamber pressures, probe distances and plasma gas flow rates. The processed powders varied in size according to the cyclones designed to collect the powders from medium to ultra-fine. The chamber collecting ultrafine powder contained particles ranging from 10 nm to 4 mum. The particle size, morphology and phase concentration of the powders were characterised using SEM, TEM, XRD and FTIR. In general, the particle size decreased with increasing plate power, while the reverse was observed for the volume of nano-sized particles produced. Decomposition into other phases such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP), tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and calcium oxide (CaO) increased with increasing plate power. This study suggests that the processing parameters associated with the production of the ultra-fine powders interact in a complex manner but can be rationalised by considering the overall thermal treatment experienced by the particulates during plasma treatment.

Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, naturally derived extracellular matrix (ECM) that has been used for tissue remodeling and repair in numerous xenotransplantations. Although a vigorous immune response to xenogeneic extracellular matrix biomaterials is expected, to date there has been evidence for only normal tissue regeneration without any accompanying rejection. The purpose of this study was to determine the reason for a lack of rejection. Methods. Mice were implanted s.c. with xenogeneic tissue, syngeneic tissue, or SIS, and the graft site analyzed histologically for rejection or acceptance. Additionally, graft site cytokine levels were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and SIS-specific serum antibody isotype levels were determined by ELISA. Results. Xenogeneically implanted mice showed an acute inflammatory response followed by chronic inflammation and ultimately graft necrosis, consistent with rejection. Syngeneically or SIS implanted mice, however, showed an acute inflammatory response that diminished such that the graft ultimately became indistinguishable from native tissue, observations that are consistent with graft acceptance, Graft site cytokine analysis showed an increase in interleukin-4 and an absence of interferon-gamma, In addition, mice implanted with SIS produced a SIS-specific antibody response that was restricted to the IgG1 isotype, Reimplantation of SIS into mice led to a secondary anti-SIS antibody response that was still restricted to IgG1, Similar results were observed with porcine submucosa derived from urinary bladder. To determine if the observed immune responses were T cell dependent, T cell KO mice were implanted with SIS. These mice expressed neither interleukin-4 at the implant site nor anti-SIS-specific serum antibodies but they did accept the SIS graft. Conclusions, Porcine extracellular matrix elicits an immune response that is predominately Th2-like, consistent with a remodeling reaction rather than rejection.","Albany Med Coll, Ctr Immunol & Microbial Dis, Albany, NY 12208 USA; Albany Med Coll, Dept Pathol, Albany, NY 12208 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Med Coll Ohio, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Toledo, OH 43614 USA","Metzger, DW (reprint author), Albany Med Coll, Ctr Immunol & Microbial Dis, MC 151,47 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208 USA.",,,"Metzger, Dennis/0000-0002-8000-9907; Badylak, Stephen/0000-0003-3555-0689",NHLBI NIH HHS [HL60359],,,31,217,256,2,21,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0041-1337,,,TRANSPLANTATION,Transplantation,JUN 15,2001.0,71,11,,,,,1631,1640,,10.1097/00007890-200106150-00024,,,,10,Immunology; Surgery; Transplantation,Immunology; Surgery; Transplantation,444VN,WOS:000169420900024,11435976.0,,,,2019-02-25

These cells were used because of the great importance of bone cells in many aspects of biomaterials research. Silane-modified surfaces were characterized by contact angle measurements and, subsequently, surface energies were calculated. Cells grown on clean glass, as well as those grown on glass surfaces containing the functional groups cited above, were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy and assessed for their growth characteristics (i.e., determination of cell number and Ki67 antigen expression). The data presented seemed to indicate that if Saos-2 cells are grown on silane-modifed surfaces containing the methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH), and phenyl (C6H5) functional groups, their proliferation is slowed down while growth of these cells on glass surfaces modified with amino (NH2) and carboxyl (COOH) groups did not significantly affect growth. Once it was demonstrated that these three functional groups induce significant variations in proliferation, cells grown on these surfaces were also tested for apoptosis and expression of important markers of bone cell differentiation (i.e., osteonectin and osteopontin) by flow cytometry and eventual rearrangement of these markers by fluorescence microscopy. The data suggested that growth of Saos-2 cells on CH3 induces the most evident morphological changes while growth of these cells on OH and C6H5 brings about the greater variations in osteonectin and osteopontin. We hypothesized that these changes are indicative of an increase in differentiation of Saos-2 cells when grown on the OH and C6H5 groups.

Frequently, plates or wires are inadequate in fixating all fragments together, resulting in less than optimal outcomes. Advancements in the development of biomaterials have now made titanium mesh a new option for the repair of severely comminuted fractures. Methods: Fourteen patients with severely comminuted frontal sinus fractures were treated with titanium mesh from 1994 to 1999. The fractures were reduced and immobilized using a simple algorithm: (1) Isolated anterior table fractures were repaired with reduced bony fragments attached to titanium mesh. (2) Anterior table fractures with nasofrontal duct involvement were repaired by sinus obliteration and anterior wall reconstruction with reduced bony fragments attached to titanium mesh. (3) Anterior and posterior table fractures with cerebrospinal fluid leak or displacement were treated with the cranialization of the sinus and anterior wall reconstruction with reduced bony fragments attached to titanium mesh. Results: Of the 14 patients treated, 12 were available for postoperative evaluation. Parameters such as nasal function, cranial nerve V and VII function, cosmesis, and complications (hardware extrusions, sinusitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, mucopyocele, brain abscess, pneumocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid leak) were evaluated. All patients had good function of the superior division of cranial nerves V and VII. Two patients (16%) had minor wound infections, which resolved under treatment with antibiotics. All had excellent cosmetic results as measured by postreduction radiographs and personal and family perceptions of forehead contour. Conclusion: Titanium mesh reconstruction of severely comminuted frontal sinus fractures has few complications while providing excellent forehead contour and cosmesis.","Univ Calif Irvine, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Orange, CA 92868 USA; Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Detroit, MI USA","Shibuya, TY (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 101 City Dr S,Bldg 25, Orange, CA 92868 USA.",,,,,,,25,26,26,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0886-4470,,,ARCH OTOLARYNGOL,Arch.

Acrylamide groups readily react with thiol groups, and peptides containing a single thiol group were coupled to the PEG-diacrylamide in aqueous solution at room temperature in about 2 h. If only a portion of the acrylamide groups were targeted for reaction with peptide, sufficient amounts of PEG-diacrylamide remained to be polymerized by free-radical mechanisms via photoinitiation. The photopolymerization step can be performed in contact with cells, providing a means to produce bioactive scaffolds for tissue engineering. The photopolymerization conditions and precursor composition greatly affect the stiffness of the materials, which subsequently affected cell spreading. The kinetics and extent of cell spreading on the bioactive materials were measured and compared to cell spreading on tissue culture polystyrene. Although the PEG materials resist protein adsorption, the experiments suggest that the cells can secrete extracellular matrix that can adhere to the gels.","ETH Zurich, Dept Mat, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; ETH Zurich, Inst Biomed Engn, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland","Hubbell, JA (reprint author), ETH Zurich, Dept Mat, Moussonstr 18, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Elbert, Donald/B-2040-2008; Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Elbert, Donald/0000-0001-6480-9536; Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",,,,42,295,298,2,81,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,SUM,2001.0,2,2,,,,,430,441,,10.1021/bm0056299,,,,12,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,528RF,WOS:000174256200015,11749203.0,,,,2019-02-25

These biomaterials are chemically complex and have been difficult to analyze. Furthermore, the cascade of reactions involving o-quinones is poorly understood, and it has been difficult to mimic ex vivo for materials processing. We report the use of a combinatorial approach to learn how tyrosinase and low molecular weight phenolic precursors can be used to generate biologically active protein-polysaccharide conjugates. Specifically, we screened various phenolic coupling precursors and various reaction conditions for the coupling of proteins onto the polysaccharide chitosan. Several natural phenols were identified as appropriate precursors for the coupling of polyhistidine tagged organophosphorus hydrolase (His-OPH) onto chitosan films. OPH activity was retained upon coupling and subsequent studies indicated that the histidine tag was not necessary for coupling. Using conditions identified for His-OPH coupling, we observed that various biologically active proteins (cytochrome c, OPH, and His-CAT) could be coupled onto chitosan films. The glycosylated protein horseradish peroxidase was not effectively coupled onto chitosan under the conditions studied. In all cases studied, we observed that coupling required a phenolic precursor, suggesting that tyrosinase is unable to couple by reaction with surface tyrosyl residues of the target protein. In conclusion, this study illustrates a combinatorial approach for the ""discovery"" of conditions to couple biologically active proteins onto chitosan through natural, quinone-based processes.","Univ Maryland, Maryland Biotechnol Inst, Agr Biotechnol Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biotecnol, Cuernavaca 62250, Morelos, Mexico; Univ Maryland, Dept Chem Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Payne, GF (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Maryland Biotechnol Inst, Agr Biotechnol Ctr, 5115 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",payne@umbi.umd.edu,"Vazquez-Duhalt, Rafael/E-2751-2016","Vazquez-Duhalt, Rafael/0000-0003-1612-2996",,,,35,60,61,1,24,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,SUM,2001.0,2,2,,,,,456,462,,10.1021/bm000125w,,,,7,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,528RF,WOS:000174256200018,11749206.0,,,,2019-02-25

In addition, during the 72h incubation period light-microscopic observations were performed daily. After 24h of incubation with dextran and dex-HEMA polymers, the cells showed elongated or spider-like forms, some lipid droplets and intracellular granula, indicative of pinocytosis and internalization of the polymers. During the next two days, the fibroblasts' appearance did not change. Methacrylic acid (MAA), formed by hydrolysis of dex-HEMA, did not influence the cell morphology. Dex-HEMA polymer solutions with a low and high degree of substitution (DS) at 100 mg/ml caused a CPII of 30-40% after 72 h. This is less than 10% growth inhibition per cell cycle and statistically not different from the CPII induced by 100 mg;ml dextran T40. Growth inhibition induced by MAA was also low. The various dex-MA hydrogel discs caused similar low growth inhibition. Interestingly, hydrogel microspheres of dex-MA and dex-(lactate)HEMA caused a CPII of only 0-20% after 72 h. The results presented in this study demonstrate that methacrylate-derivatized dextran hydrogels show good biocompatibility in vitro making these degradable biomaterials promising systems for drug delivery purposes.

In contrast to the first challenge, the second challenge with the same type of material, but at a different subcutaneous site of the same animal, induced an increase of macrophages and giant cells inside the biodegradable materials. Additionally, only after the second challenge clusters and accumulations of plasma cells were present in the surrounding tissue of each type of material. Tn the same areas an increase of MHC II expression was measured by immunocytochemistry. Differences in the numbers of macrophages and T cells were not observed around the explants. Undifferentiated B cells or NK cells were not present at any time point. The results indicate that alterations observed after the second challenge did not depend on biodegradation of the materials. Significance of these Endings should be considered in view of increased and repetitive use of the same type of biomaterial (possibly for different application sites) for implantation in patients.

In the cartilage of the external ear of the rabbit multiple holes, 6 mm in diameter, were punched, leaving the adherent skin intact. Different experimental groups were evaluated. First, the punch-hole model was validated under various conditions to study spontaneous or perichondrial initiated regeneration of the cartilage defect. When both cartilage and perichondrium was excised no spontaneous repair of the cartilage defect was observed. When perichondrium is present, variable patch-like closure of the punch hole was found. As 'golden standard' a punched out piece of cartilage was reimplanted directly. This condition showed adequate closure of the punch hole, however, no perfect integration of graft and surrounding cartilage was observed. Secondly, to evaluate the 'punch-hole model' a biomaterial, trabecular demineralized bovine bone matrix (DBM), was implanted and tested as a scaffold for tissue engineering techniques in vivo and in vitro. Direct implantation of DBM did not lead to any cartilage formation to close the defect. In vivo engineered cartilage, generated by enveloping DBM in perichondrium for 3 weeks, could adequately close the punch hole. When DBM was seeded with isolated chondrocytes in vitro before implantation in the defect, a highly fragmented graft, with some islets of viable cells was seen. To promote an efficient and reliable evaluation of cartilage grafts a semi-quantitative grading system was developed. Items such as quality, quantity and integrity of the cartilage graft were included in a histomorphological grading system to provide information about the properties of a specific cartilage graft. To validate the grading system, all conditions were scored by two independent observers. An excellent reliability (R = 0.96) was seen between the observers. In summary, the rabbit pinna punch-hole model is a reliable and efficient method for first evaluation of cartilage grafts. The results can be easily analyzed using a semi-quantitative grading system.

The contribution of biological molecules on cell-bioactive glass interaction is largely unknown. To further analyze the mechanisms involved in efficient bone bonding to bioactivity glass, Saos-2 osteoblastic cells with proven osteogenic phenotype were cultured for 4, 7 and 14 days on two bioactive glasses with different Si contents. Culture plates and dishes made of bioactive (BAG, 53% SiO2), biocompatible (BCG, 58% SiO2) and control (G0) glasses were extensively conditioned with phosphate buffer and DMEM medium before seeding the cells. Northern hybridization was used for analysis of mRNA levels of collagen type I (Col-I), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). A significant increase was observed in Col-I mRNA levels in cells grown on the two bioactive glasses when compared with those grown on controls at 4 and 7 days (p < 0.04), The mRNA level for ALP in the cultures of bioactive glasses-made plates and dishes was also increased over control at 7 days (p < 0.02) and remained this way between BAG and GO at 14 days. Striking differences in BMP-2 mRNA levels existed between BAG and CO plates and dishes at 7 days (p < 0.05). BMP-2 mRNA level in BAG group was higher than in BCG group at 4, 7 and 14 days, but without statistical significance. Saos-2 osteoblastic cells with strong ALP staining were mostly seen on BAG plates under a light microscope. In confocal microscopy, a bright FITC-stained F-actin ring was present in the cytoplasm of cells grown on BAG dish, demonstrating an active Functional status. Stimulation of the expression of BMP-2 and other bone mRNAs by bioactive glasses in osteoblastic cells suggests biological involvement of bone related growth factors, peptides and cytokines in bone - bioactive glass bonding.

So Far, non destructive analysis have been performed using contact radiography giving the scope for great advances in the production and application of new materials. However. the nature of interaction. namely X-ray absorption, limited the observations only to materials having sufficient heavy elements content. The adoption of a different X-ray interaction with matter which involves refractive properties of materials is at the basis of phase-contrast imaging. The novel method allows the use of high X-ray energies. for a deeper penetration and a lower released dose, without losing any information on the nature of the sample.

Composites of PET with wollastonite in two different proportions, viz. 70/30 (PW-30), 50/50 (PW-50) were prepared. The DSC studies indicate marginal changes in the melting behavior and enhanced crystallization in PBT/W composites. The mechanical properties of the composites such as tensile modulus shows remarkable improvement as a result of incorporation of wollastonite. SEM studies of fractured surfaces of impact samples showed no evidence of bonding between PET and wollastonite. Water contact angle of PW30 and PW50 was 73.7 and 78.7 degrees, respectively. In vitro biocompatibility of PW-30 was evaluated as a representative composite. Direct cell contact test did not show deleterious effects on NIH3T3 fibroblast morphology and DNA integrity indicating its compatibility. Leach out products (LOP) of PW-30 were evaluated non-toxic as tested by MTT assay. Mouse peritoneal macrophages in contact with PW-30 showed comparable expression of CD 11b/18, CD45, CD14 and B7.2 to macrophages in contact with PTFE control indicating its non-activating nature.

The influence of gentamicin release on biofilm formation was quantified by expressing the number of colony-forming units on gentamicin-loaded cement relative to the number of viable organisms on unloaded cement of the same brand. Biofilms formed on all gentamicin-loaded cements, despite the release of antibiotics. followed a consistent pattern in time with a maximum number of colony-forming units per unit cement area found between 24 and 30 h after inoculation. None of the gentamicin-loaded cements showed a reduction in biofilm formation relative to unloaded cements within 6 h after inoculation, whereas only gentamicin-loaded CMW1 and Palacos reduced biofilm formation 24 h after inoculation. Alternatively, CMW Endurance. CMW2000, and Palamed did not exhibit any initial reductions in biofilm formation, but effects started after 72, 48, and 72 h. respectively. Biofilm reduction by gentamicin-loaded CMW3 lasted the longest from 24 to 72 h. Interestingly, each cement seemed to have a different ""window-of-effectiveness"" with regard to reduction in biofilm formation that did not relate with the gentamicin-release kinetics. Summarising, this study demonstrates that although gentamicin loading of bone cements yields reductions in biofilm formation, S. aureus is able to grow on gentamicin-loaded bone cements.

Several materials and devices have been developed to circumvent the problem of islet rejection by the recipient, but, so far, none has proved to be totally effective. A major barrier to transpose is the highly organized islet architecture and its physical and chemical setting in the pancreatic parenchyma. In order to tackle this problem, we assembled a multidisciplinary team that has been working towards setting up the Human Pancreatic Islets Unit at the Chemistry Institute of the University of S (a) over tildeo Paulo, to collect and process pancreas from human donors, upon consent, in order to produce purified, viable and functional islets to be used in transplants. Collaboration with the private enterprise has allowed access to the latest developed biomaterials for islet encapsulation and immunoisolation. Reasoning that the natural islet microenvironment should be mimicked for optimum viability and function, we set out to isolate extracellular matrix components from human pancreas, not only for analytical purposes, but also to be used as supplementary components of encapsulating materials. A protocol was designed to routinely culture different pancreatic tissues (islets, parenchyma and ducts) in the presence of several pancreatic extracellular matrix components and peptide growth factors to enrich the beta cell population in vitro before transplantation into patients. In addition to representing a therapeutic promise, this initiative is an example of productive partnership between the medical and scientific sectors of the university and private enterprises.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Univ Miami, Diabet Res Inst, Miami, FL USA; Biobras SA, Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; Hosp Beneficencia Portuguesa, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Hosp Heliopolis, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Sogayar, MC (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Caixa Postal 26077, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",,"Aita, Carlos Alberto/C-2243-2008; Correa-Giannella, Maria Lucia/D-2003-2012; Maria-Engler, Silvya/K-5936-2016","Aita, Carlos Alberto/0000-0003-4871-7740; Correa-Giannella, Maria Lucia/0000-0003-3655-4446; Maria-Engler, Silvya/0000-0003-4771-6041; Sogayar, Mari/0000-0003-4805-4609",,,,53,20,24,0,3,ASSOC BRAS DIVULG CIENTIFICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE MEDICINA, SALA 21, 14049 RIBEIRAO PRETO, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",0100-879X,,,BRAZ J MED BIOL RES,Brazilian J.

The frequency dependence was well described by both an Arrhenius-type model and by the WLF (Williams, Landel and Ferry) equation, yielding glass transition temperatures for an average molecular vibration time of 100 s, which were similar to published midpoint temperatures determined by DSC scans. Some sugar mixtures were studied, yielding results that were well described by the Gordon-Taylor equation, using literature data.

In this part, DNA synthesis and collagen formation on implant materials were quantitatively and qualitatively estimated by radioactive isotope H(+)-thymidine to incorporate into DNA chains, H(+)-proline to incorporate into type I collagen proteins followed by scintillation counting and antibody-antigen immunocytochemistry staining, respectively. Research results demonstrate that hydroxyapatite (HA) stimulates DNA synthesis and collagen formation on the material whereas this stimulation is restricted by adding spinel to the materials. There are statistical differences between the influences of material components on both DNA synthesis and collagen formation. It is supposed that porous materials can supply more platforms for cell anchoring, and more DNA and collagen are synthesised on the porous materials.

Semiconductor and optical materials, composites, ceramics, biomaterials, advanced polymers, and specialized alloys are some of the materials that have seen intense interest and research activity over the last two decades. New approaches have been developed to improve product quality reduce cost, and achieve essentially custom-made material properties. Current trends indicate continued research effort in materials processing as demand for specialized materials continues to increase. Fluid flow that arises in many materials processing applications is critical in the determination of the quality and characteristics of the final product and in the control, operation, and optimization of the system. This review is focused on the fluid flow phenomena underlying a wide variety of materials processing operations such as optical fiber manufacture, crystal growth for semiconductor fabrication, casting, thin film manufacture, and polymer processing. The review outlines the main aspects that must be considered in materials processing, the basic considerations that are common across fluid flow phenomena involved in different areas, the present state of the art in analytical, experimental and numerical techniques that may be employed to study the flow, and the effect of fluid flow on the process and the product. The main issues that distinguish flow in materials processing from that in other fields, as well as the similar aspects, are outlined. The complexities that are inherent in materials processing, such as large material property changes, complicated domains, multiple regions, combined mechanisms, find complex boundary conditions are discussed. The governing equations and boundary conditions for typical processes, along with important parameters, common simplifications and specialized methods employed to study these processes are outlined. The field is vast and it is not possible to consider all the different techniques employed for materials processing. Among the processes discussed in some detail are polymer extrusion, optical fiber drawing, casting continuous processing, and chemical vapor deposition for the fabrication of thin films. Besides indicating the effect of fluid flow on the final product, these results illustrate the nature of the basic problems, solution strategies, and issues involved in the area. The review also discusses present trends in materials processing and suggests future research needs. Of particular importance are well-controlled and well-designed experiments that would provide inputs for model validation and for increased understanding of the underlying fluid flow mechanisms. Also, accurate material property data are very much needed to obtain accurate and repeatable results that can form the basis for design and optimization. There is need for the development of innovative numerical and experimental approaches to study the complex flows that commonly arise in materials processing. Materials processing techniques that are in particular need of further detailed work are listed Finally, it is stessed that it is critical to understand the basic mechanisms that determine changes in the material, in addition to the fluid flow aspects, in order to impact on the overall field of materials processing.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA","Jaluria, Y (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",,,,,,,145,32,32,0,21,ASME-AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENG,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0098-2202,,,J FLUID ENG-T ASME,J.

This process, known as the foreign body reaction (FBR), develops in response to almost all biomaterials and consists of overlapping phases similar to those in wound healing. Implantation of porous biomaterials, such as polyvinyl alcohol sponges, also leads to granuloma formation within the interstices of the sponge prior to encapsulation by the FBR. We asked whether delivery of an antisense cDNA for the potent angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin (TSP) 2 would enhance blood vessel formation and alter collagen fibrillogenesis in the sponge granuloma and capsule. Collagen solutions were mixed with plasmid to generate gene-activated matrices (GAMs) and applied to biomaterials that were then implanted subcutaneously. Sustained expression of plasmid-encoded proteins was observed at 2 weeks and a month following implantation. In vivo delivery of plasmids, encoding either sense or antisense TSP2 cDNA, altered blood vessel formation and collagen deposition in TSP2-null and wild-type mice, respectively. Untreated implants, implanted next to CAM-treated implants, did not show exogenous gene expression and did not elicit altered responses, suggesting that gene delivery was limited to implant sites. This method of antisense DNA delivery has the potential to improve the performance and life span of implantable delivery devices and biosensors.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bornstein, P (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Box 357350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [AR45418]; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL18645],,,35,40,42,0,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1525-0016,,,MOL THER,Mol.

Humeral head components have been recently developed, which are adaptable to the variable anatomy of the proximal humerus (third generation design). A precise reconstruction of the three dimensional structure of the proximal humerus may lead to an improved functional outcome. However, there is still a lack of biomechanical data to support this concept. The optimal design of the glenoid component remains a challenge for future research. Specific issues including the choice of biomaterials, the optimum shape, radius of curvature, surface area of the articulation, component height and stem design remain under investigation.

However, in vitro and in vivo calcifications of these polymers have been found to seriously compromise their quality as biomaterials. Zn consideration of this problem, the present study compared the calcification rate and extent of PTFE, PU and silicone. Using the in vitro flow-type method, PTFE, PU and silicone mms were tested for 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days. After 21 days of in vitro calcification test, the calcium levels on PTFE, PU and silicone were 35.89 +/- 5.01 mug/cm(2) 23.73 +/- 0.68 mug/cm(2) and 19.86 +/- 5.28 mug/cm(2), respectively. The higher observed calcium level for PTFE may be due to the effect of the rough surface of PTFE in accumulating calcium ions on the polymer surface From the 7th day of feat, the [Ca]/[P] molar ratio started to decrease over time, and PTFE showed a faster calcification process. This decreasing [Ca]/[P] molar ratio demonstrated the typical calcification mechanism consisting of phosphorus ion accumulation following calcium ion accumulation. This. study concluded that PU and silicone are less calcified than PTFE film, a finding in good agreement with previously published studies.","Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, Seoul 120752, South Korea","Suh, H (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",,,,,,,29,10,10,0,6,YONSEI UNIV COLLEGE MEDICINE,SEOUL,"C/O KYUN0-IL IM, M.D., PH.D, SHINCHON DONG 134, SEODAEMOON KU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

We have deposited uniform 10 nm to nearly 1 mum thin films of insulin and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). We performed several experiments to characterize the chemical integrity of the deposited films. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments performed on MAPLE-deposited insulin films indicate that the laser-material interaction involved in this deposition technique does not modify the protein's mass. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the chemical functionality and secondary structure of MAPLE-deposited HRP are nearly identical to those of the native protein. We also find that deposited HRP films retain their ability to catalyze the reduction of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), suggesting that the active site of transferred proteins is unaffected by the MAPLE process. We also produced patterns and multilayers with feature sizes from 20 to 250 mum by depositing different biomaterials through a shadow mask. Patterns of physisorbed HRP were then protected from dissolution in an aqueous environment by a semipermeable polymer overlayer that was deposited in situ using pulsed laser deposition. This polymer membrane protects the protein pattern when it is exposed to DAB solution and enables the optical observation of HRP activity for spots as small as 2000 mum(2). These results demonstrate that MAPLE is a preferred technique for depositing active biomolecules for applications ranging from microfluidic sensor devices to gene and protein recognition microarrays.","USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; So Oregon Univ, Dept Phys, Ashland, OR 97520 USA","Ringeisen, BR (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Code 6372, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",,,,,,,52,102,102,0,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 29,2001.0,17,11,,,,,3472,3479,,10.1021/la0016874,,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,436UY,WOS:000168955300048,,,,,2019-02-25

Samples of bone tissue have been retrieved at different times after implantation for spectroscopic study. The ratio of bone components has been calculated from the FTIR spectra of the samples. based on the integrated areas of the bands brought about by the vibrations of phosphates and amide groups. Additionally: the analysis of the shape and intensity of these bands provided information on developing and on the rate of bone mineralization.

Degree of equilibrium swelling, scanning electron microscopy, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) were used to characterize the bulk and surface properties. Vitamin B(12) and human serum albumin were used as permeability markers. Platelet adhesion and activation were used to determine the blood-interaction properties of the PIN membranes. Unlike chitosan membranes that were nonporous, the chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes were highly porous with the pore size, depending on the type of incorporated Pluronic polyol. ESCA results showed a significant increase in the -(C) under bar -O- signal of C1s spectra on the PIN membranes that correlates with the presence of PEO chains on the surface. The permeability coefficients of vitamin B(12) and albumin were higher in the chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes than in the control. The number of adherent platelets and the extent of activation were significantly reduced on the chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes. The decrease in platelet adhesion and activation correlated positively with the PEO chain length of the incorporated Pluronic polyols. The results of this study show that chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes offer a blood-compatible alternative with a higher-molecular-weight cutoff for use in hemodialysis and related applications.

However, the drawbacks of these biomaterials are poor durability and relatively high costs of production. Thus, the technique of molecular imprinting [Bio/Technology 14 (1996) 163; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 34 (1995) 1812; Anal. Commun. 36 (9) (1999) 327; J. Chromatogr. 781 (1997) 43] can be applied for generating much more stable polymeric mimics of biological enzymes. For this purpose, a stable transition state analogue (TSA) of a selected reaction must be chosen as template [Macromol. Rapid Commun. 19 (1998) 671; Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 3 (1999) 759]. The imprint of the TSA acts like a catalytically active centre. This binding site shows its catalytic effect by reducing the activation energy of the specific reaction. In the work presented here, molecularly imprinted catalytically active polymers have been generated and investigated in chemical reaction engineering processes, using batch reactors and continuously driven reactors equipped with these polymers. Parameters such as temperature, concentration of substrate or volume flow have been varied, reaction rates measured and kinetic data recorded. Based on this information, the rate constants of the reaction have been calculated, as well as the relative catalytic effects. It is demonstrated that imprinted polymer catalysts show obvious catalytic properties and can be used as an alternative for traditional catalyst materials. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The effects of the fibroin/chitosan blend ratios (chitosan content) on the physical and mechanical properties were investigated to discover the feasibility of using these films as biomedical materials such as artificial skin and wound dressing. The mechanical properties of the blend films containing 10-40% chitosan were found to be excellent. The tensile strength, breaking elongation, and Young's modulus were affected by the chitosan contents of the blend films, which were also related to the density and degree of swelling. The coefficient of water vapor permeability of the blend films increased linearly with the chitosan content, and the values of 1000-2000 g m(-2) day(-1) were comparable to those of commercial wound dressings. Silk fibroin/chitosan blend films had good oxygen and water vapor permeabilities, making them useful as biomaterials. In particular, the blend film containing 40-50% chitosan showed very high oxygen permeability.

In CRI, the sample is modulated at a resonance frequency of the tip-sample contact, while the average position of the tip still remains in contact with the surface, i.e. in the repulsive region of the force-distance curve. The improvement in image resolution is demonstrated using various biological and polymeric specimens under ambient laboratory conditions and in liquid media.

The sputter-deposition of the pure titanium film and the Ti-O films were carried out in Ar gas and in Ar-O-2 gas mixtures, respectively. Both the pure titanium film deposited in Ar and the Ti-O films deposited in Ar-O-2 appeared to be uniform and adhesive. Under AES, the Ti/O ratio in depth direction was nearly constant in each of the films and oxygen concentration increased with increasing oxygen content of the sputter gas. Based on XRD, it was concluded that oxygen atoms dissolved into or-titanium crystals at lower oxygen contents, while suboxides such as Ti4O7 and Ti6O11 and oxides such as TiO2(anatase) were formed at higher oxygen contents. It was found that the orientation of the or-titanium phase formed in the Ti-O films changed from (002) dominant to (011) dominant with increasing oxygen content. The Vickers hardness of the films increased linearly with increasing oxygen content, and the maximum hardness reached over Hv = 1600. Furthermore, it was found that the ductility of the deposited pure titanium film was improved under such high temperatures as 800 degreesC and that its elongation reached over 160%, while the Ti-O films were still brittle under such a high temperature.

Chain tethering can also can improve the mucoadhesive behavior of a delivery device and the effectiveness of a drug by allowing targeting and localization of a drug at a specific site. Acrylic-based hydrogels are well-suited for mucoadhesion due to their flexibility and nonabrasive characteristics which reduce damage-causing attrition to the tissues in contact. However, the adhesive and drug delivery capabilities of these devices can continue to be improved as presently known bioadhesive materials are modified and more bioadhesive materials are discovered. Tethering of long PEG chains on PAA hydrogels rind their copolymers can be achieved by grafting reactions involving thionyl chloride, followed by PEG grafting. The ensuing materials exhibit mucoadhesive properties due to enhanced anchoring of the chains with the mucosa. Theoretical calculations can lead to optimization of Be tethered structure.

Two of such approaches developed in the authors' laboratory were described here. One approach was to assemble hybrid hydrogels from coiled coil protein domains and synthetic polymers. Preliminary results showed that temperature-sensitive volume transition of the hybrid hydrogels could be triggered by the thermal unfolding of the engineered coiled coil protein domains. The other approach, discussed in detail, was to construct an epitope display model system based on a coiled coil stem loop peptide self-assembled on a solid substrate. This model construct displayed a constrained nonapeptide sequence, which was found to mediate specific binding with immunocompetent cells bearing complementary surface receptors. These novel approaches will likely find important applications in the rational design of more effective drug delivery systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

Modifications that only change the net charge of collagen, such as acetylation, succinylation, and treatment with glutaraldehyde tall increase the negative charge), and amination with ethylenediamine (EDA), N,N-dimethyl-EDA (DMEDA), or butylamine tall increase the positive charge), did not dramatically alter the mammalian cell attachment to the film. In contrast, derivatization of collagen using methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG] diminished the attachment of fibroblasts by 98 +/- 1% and of endothelial cells by more than 99% compared to unmodified collagen. Moreover, the rate of growth of fibroblasts dropped by 97 +/- 1% and that of endothelial cells by 88 +/- 3% as a result of PEGylation of collagen. Adhesion of S. aureus cells also plummeted by 93 +/- 2% as a result of this PEGylation. With these antifouling properties, PEG-collagen may be a promising coating material for coronary stents. Subsequent derivatization of PEG-collagen with EDA or DMEDA abolished its mammalian cell-repelling ability, whereas bacterial cell repulsion was partially retained: for example, DMEDA-modified PEG-collagen exhibits up to a 5-fold lower bacterial adhesion than collagen. It is worth noting that a material that allows mammalian cell attachment but reduces bacterial adhesion could be useful as an implant or coating.

Calcific degeneration is the major drawback of bioprostheses. None of the numerous preventive approaches omitted calcification. Previous studies showed that cellular surface seeding decreases calcium uptake in vitro but achievement of coverage remains problematic. A new approach is presented masking glutaraldehyde residues with a polymer layer allowing cell seeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate different polymers for suitability. Methods. Ten polymers-covalently bound to glass-were tested for their ability to seed animal and human cells. Quality of coverage was evaluated by light and scanning electron microscopy, and polymers were characterized physicochemically. Results. Quality of cellular growth was similar for canine and human cells. Five polymers allowed excellent surface coverage, two led to a decrease of cell adherence, and four to poor cellular growth. No correlation between molecular weight, thickness, hydrophilicity, or charge of the polymer and cell growth was found. Conclusions. Polymer monolayers can promote cellular growth but without correlation to physicochemical characteristics. Polymers covalently bound to biologic tissue appear to be a promising approach for achieving cellular coverage of biomaterials.

This paper describes a preliminary study on the development of a new method to produce biodegradable scaffolds from a range of corn-starch-based polymers. In some cases, hydroxlapatite was also used as a reinforcement of the biodegradable polymers. The developed methodology consists of a standard conventional injection moulding process, on which a solid blowing agent based on carboxylic acids is used to generate the foaming of the bulk of the moulded part. The proposed route allows for the production of scaffolds with a compact skin and a porous core, with promising mechanical properties. By using the developed method it is possible to manufacture biodegradable polymer scaffolds in an easy (melt-based processing) and reproducible manner. The scaffolds can be moulded into complex shapes, and the blowing additives do not affect the non-cytotoxic behaviour of the starch-based materials. The materials produced using this method were evaluated with respect to the morphology of the porous structure, and the respective mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. It was demonstrated that it is possible to obtain, by a standard melt based processing route, 3D scaffolds with complex shapes that exhibit an appropriate morphology, without decreasing significantly the mechanical properties of the materials. It is believed that the optimisation of the proposed processing methodology may lead to the production of scaffolds that might be used on the regeneration of load-bearing tissues.

We report on the ability of covalently bound PEG films in long-term cell culture to continually retard protein adhesion and cell growth. PDMS microstamps were used to create poly-d-lysine (PDL) substrates permissive to cell attachment and growth, and polyethylene glycol(PEG) substrates were used to minimize protein and cell adhesion. Film thickness was measured using null ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Organosilane film structure was examined using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Long-term film stability in cell culture conditions was tested by immersion in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for up to one month. Null ellipsometry and water contact measurements indicated that organosilane films were stable up to one month, whereas the PEG film thickness declined rapidly after day 25. Hippocampal cells plated at 200 cells/mm(2) on uniform PEG substrates gave a steady increase in biofilm thickness on PEG films throughout the culture, possibly from proteins of neuronal origin. We found that all the layers in the cross-linking procedure were stable in cell culture conditions, with the exception of PEG, which degraded after day 25. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One hypothesis is that an electrical stimulus alters the local electrical fields of extracellular matrix molecules, changing protein adsorption. We have investigated this hypothesis - that electrical stimulation increases the adsorption of serum proteins, specifically fibronectin (FN), to the electrically conducting polymer polypyrrole (PP), thereby, increasing neurite extension. PP was used because electrical stimulation of PP has been shown to significantly enhance neurite outgrowth, and more importantly, PP can be formed into conduits to guide nerve regeneration in vivo. Here, we looked at the effects of electrical stimulation on protein adsorption when an electrical current was applied to PP (1)during protein adsorption (immediate stimulation) and (2) several hours after protein adsorption (delayed stimulation). We found that immediate stimulation of PP increases FN adsorption from purified FN and serum-containing solutions. Correspondingly, PC-12 cells grown on PP films that had been previously adsorbed with FN during immediate stimulation expressed longer neurites. However, for delayed stimulation, no significant differences in adsorption or neurite outgrowth were observed. These studies suggest that increased FN adsorption with immediate electrical stimulation may explain enhanced neurite extension on electrically stimulated PP. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. Results. In the suspension test, all gramnegative species were inhibited, but grampositive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. Conclusions.

A major consideration in designing implants has been to produce surfaces that promote desirable responses in the cells and tissues. To achieve these requirements, the titanium implant surface can be modified in various ways. This research was designed to elucidate the relationship between surface roughness (R-a) and contact angle (theta) of various engineered titanium surfaces of commercially pure titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), and titanium-nickel (TiNi) alloy. The contact angle was measured using distilled water, 1% sodium chloride solution, human neutrophils, and osteoblast-like cells. Surface oxide crystallography was identified by transmission electron diffraction, It was found that: (1) there were no significant differences in contact angles among the 4 media; (2) for commercially pure titanium, a combined treatment (hydrofluoric acid/nitric acid/water --> sodium hydroxide --> oxidation) showed the lowest theta (10.51 degrees in water), while the surface treated with sulfuric acid showed the highest value (72.99 degrees in water); (3) for all commercially pure titanium samples, when theta is greater than 45 degrees, the contact angle increases linearly with R-a (hydrophobic nature) and the surface is covered with rutile-type oxide only, while the contact angle decreases linearly with R-a when theta is less than 45 degrees (hydrophilic nature) and the surface is covered with a mixture of rutile and anatase oxides; and (4) a similar trend was found on Ti-6Al-4V and TiNi surfaces.","Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Dent Mat Div, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; Kangbuk Samsung Hosp Dent Ctr, Dept Prosthodont, Seoul, South Korea; Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Grad Prosthodont Program, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Oshida, Y (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Dent Mat Div, 1121 W Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",yoshida@iupui.edu,,,,,,44,85,93,0,23,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

The rational of conducting this investigation is to further elucidate the mechanisms of tissue-implant interaction, Thirteen Sprague-Dawley adult male albino rats were randomly divided into three groups. Animals in groups I and II (n = 5/group) were implanted at both ip and sc implantation sites with either ALCAP or TCP ceramics, respectively. Animals in group III (n = 3) were not implanted and served as the intact control for the comparative purposes. At 90 days postimplantation, the animals in all groups were euthanized (Ketamine/Zylazane) and the fibrous tissue surrounding the ceramic devices was retrieved. After routine histological processing, sections (5 mum) of tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated using light microscopy. With the exception of neutrophils, at both implantation sites, the fibrous tissues surrounding the TCP bioceramics demonstrated greater capsular thickness, more vascularity, and more macrophages, fibroblasts, and collagen than those surrounding the ALCAP ceramic. Data obtained from this investigation provided further insights into the differences in the tissue-implant responses of calcium-phosphate-based ceramics and the cellular composition of the fibrous tissue reaction found at sc and ip implantation sites.","Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Sch Hlth Related Profess, Dept Hlth Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Jackson, MS 39216 USA","Benghuzzi, HA (reprint author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Sch Hlth Related Profess, Dept Hlth Sci, 2500 N State St, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.",,,,,,,32,14,14,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

The effect on gingival tissue of various crown materials in combination with different abutment biomaterials should be investigated. Purpose. This in vivo study determined the gingival health and subgingival levels of periodontal inflammation-associated bacteria adjacent to various crown and abutment material combinations. Material and methods. Patients in the study received 1 of 5 treatments: an all-ceramic crown luted to a natural tooth, a metal-ceramic (titanium) crown luted to natural tooth, a metal-ceramic thigh noble alloy) crown luted to natural tooth, an all-ceramic crown luted to a titanium implant abutment, or a metal-ceramic thigh noble alloy) crown luted to a titanium implant abutment. Plaque was collected at least 6 months after luting by paper point from the gingival sulcus of each crown and an adjacent unrestored (control) tooth. DNA. probe analysis was performed to determine the levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, plaque, gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding scores were recorded with use of the California Dental Association scale. Statistical analysis was used to determine the effect of restoration/abutment type on levels of the bacterial species and clinical parameters pertaining to gingival health. Results. None of the sulci sampled contained detectable levels of the 3 bacteria. Plaque levels and gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding scores were low All treatment groups had similar soft tissue response as measured by gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding. Plaque scores from all-ceramic crown/implant abutment sites were higher than plaque scores from all-ceramic crown/natural tooth sites. However, differences between experimental and control sites within the same treatment group were not observed (P>.05) with any of the 4 clinical measures. Conclusion. In patients with suitable oral hygiene, tooth-supported and implant-supported crowns with intracrevicular margins were not predisposed to unfavorable gingival and microbial responses.","Univ Nebraska, Med Ctr, Coll Dent, Dept Oral Biol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Dent, Dept Occlus, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; Univ Michigan, Dept Prosthodont, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Koka, S (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Med Ctr, Coll Dent, Dept Oral Biol, 40th & Holdrege St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",skoka@unmc.edu,,,,,,30,19,23,0,3,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-3913,1097-6841,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

Studies have found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) attaches to and is eluted from dental alloys, but the biologic effects of LPS are not known. Purpose. This study evaluated the ability of dental casting alloys pre-exposed to LPS to activate human monocytes with and without subsequent elution of the LPS. Material and methods. Eight types of casting alloys (n = 6 specimens per type) were exposed to LPS (Escherichia coli @ 100 mug/mL) for 24 hours. Controls were not exposed to LPS. Teflon (Tf) (+/- LPS) served as the material control. Treated alloys were transferred to THP-1 human monocytes for 24 hours or placed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 120 hours before monocyte exposure. Monocyte activation was assessed by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion into the medium. Alloys without LPS, with LPS but without PBS elution, and with LPS and elution were compared with ANOVA and Tukey intervals (alpha=.05). Results. Specimens without LPS exposure but with elution caused no detectable TNF-alpha secretion from monocytes. Specimens without elution into PBS caused low-to-moderate TNF-alpha secretion, indicating a possible false-positive result from the alloy conditioning solution used. After LPS exposure but no elution, high levels of TNF-alpha were found. When alloys were eluted for 120 hours after LPS exposure, there was no detectable TNF-alpha released. Conclusion. In this in vitro system as in past studies, LPS appeared to adhere to and elute from the alloys. Monocytes were activated initially but not after elution into PBS for 120 hours. Alloy conditioning solutions may also have an artifactual effect on cytokine release.","Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA","Nelson, SK (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,33,2,3,0,1,"MOSBY, INC",ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",0022-3913,,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

The surface characterization and biological performance of these materials are described. This modification strategy is performed by reversible gelation of the PLA surface following exposure to a solvent/nonsolvent mixture. PEG is then able to diffuse into the swollen surface region, before it is collapsed by the addition of more nonsolvent. This results in the localized physical entrapment of the diffused material. We have demonstrated by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that control over the PEG surface density may be achieved by using predetermined process conditions, such as a particular solvent/nonsolvent ratio or a set polymer treatment time, and that surface coverage of around 75% is possible. Cell adhesion studies have shown that even in serum-containing media PEG entrapment will prevent attachment, with a 95% reduction in cell number compared to unmodified PLA. This modification strategy was also used to coentrap both PEG and poly(L-lysine)-RGD within the PLA surface region. The attachment of cells to this material shows that the entrapment approach may be used to create highly selective biomaterial surfaces that are able to prevent unwanted cell or protein adhesion yet actively promote specific cellular interaction.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Shakesheff, Kevin/O-6371-2018; Chan, Weng/O-2045-2015","Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Chan, Weng/0000-0002-0488-825X; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,24,55,59,1,16,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,2001.0,17,9,,,,,2817,2820,,10.1021/la001509a,,,,4,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,426XD,WOS:000168373000043,,,,,2019-02-25

Mixed SAMs formed from a 1:1 combination of a thiol terminated in a trimethylammonium group and a thiol terminated in a sulfonate group adsorbed less than 1% of a monolayer of two proteins with different characteristics: fibrinogen and lysozyme. Single-component SAMs formed from thiols terminating in groups combining a positively charged moiety and a negatively charged moiety were also capable of resisting the adsorption of proteins. Single-component SAMs presenting single charges adsorbed nearly a full monolayer of protein. The amount of protein that adsorbed to mixed zwitterionic SAMs did not depend on the ionic strength or the pH of the buffer in which the protein was dissolved. The amount of protein that adsorbed to single-component zwitterionic SAMs increased as the ionic strength of the buffer decreased; it also decreased as the pH of the buffer increased (at constant ionic strength). Single-component zwitterionic SAMs composed of thiols terminating in N,N-dimethyl-amino-propane-1-sulfonic acid (-N+(CH3)(2)CH2CH2CH2SO3-) groups were substantially more effective at resisting adsorption of fibrinogen and lysozyme from buffer at physiological ionic strength and pH than single-component zwitterionic SAMs composed of thiols terminating in phosphoric acid 2-trimethylamino-ethyl ester (-OP(O)(2)-OCH2CH2N+(CH3)(3)). Several of these zwitterionic SAMs were comparable to the best known systems for resisting nonspecific adsorption of protein.","Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Whitesides, GM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Chen, Xiaoxi/0000-0002-1049-3537",,,,46,530,541,6,188,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,2001.0,17,9,,,,,2841,2850,,10.1021/la0015258,,,,10,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,426XD,WOS:000168373000047,,,,,2019-02-25

Simulating harbour dredging in an experiment using suspended sediment from one of the harbours only resulted in a low concentration of TBT in the tissues of the common whelk and subsequently no changes in the occurrence and degree of imposer. The common whelk seemed to receive the main part of TBT from the water column and the limited bioaccumulation in the experiment indicates that desorption of TBT from the suspended sediment was slow. After TBT has been totally banned, dredging of contaminated sediments will cause increased exposure of the biota to TBT, Due to slow desorption the increase may however, be slight and temporary to pelagic and epibenthic species unless the settled particles are resuspended, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.","Univ Iceland, Inst Biol, IS-108 Reykjavik, Iceland; Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; CNRS, EP132, LCBIE, F-6405 Pau, France","Svavarsson, J (reprint author), Univ Iceland, Inst Biol, Grensasvegur 12, IS-108 Reykjavik, Iceland.",jorundur@hi.is,,,,,,33,19,22,1,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0025-326X,1879-3363,,MAR POLLUT BULL,Mar.

Objective:We report the development of a new peritoneal dialysis catheter. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate tissue response to this catheter. . Design: In our catheter design, the catheter's cuffs are made from sintered titanium fiber mesh instead of the common Dacron material. The catheters were implanted in goats. During the study period, the catheter exit sites were observed once every 2 weeks. After 14 weeks, the catheters and surrounding tissues were processed for histology and analyzed. . Results:We observed that catheters with titanium cuffs performed significantly better, compared with a commercial catheter design. Histology showed that titanium fibers evoked a lesser inflammatory response compared with Dacron fibers. In addition, the capsule surrounding the titanium cuff was significantly thinner. . Conclusions: Supported by the obtained results, we conclude that the use of Dacron velour for anchorage of percutaneous catheters has to be reconsidered. Titanium fiber mesh has a great potential for application in percutaneous catheters.","Univ Med Ctr, Coll Dent Sci, Dept Biomat, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; St Joseph Hosp Veldhoven, Dept Gen Surg, Veldhoven, Netherlands","Jansen, JA (reprint author), Univ Med Ctr, Coll Dent Sci, Dept Biomat, POB 9101, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,"Walboomers, X.Frank/B-3692-2013; Jansen, John/H-8055-2014",,,,,27,18,19,0,1,MULTIMED INC,TORONTO,"66 MARTIN ST, TORONTO, ON L9T 2R2, CANADA",0896-8608,,,PERITON DIALYSIS INT,Perit.

It makes optical surface sensing systems very reasonable and promising tools for its monitoring and study. We evaluated the feasibility to follow the enzymatic conversion of surface-bound fibrinogen by thrombin to fibrin monomer and possible complex formation between surface-bound fibrin monomer and fibrinogen in solution using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. For the investigations of optical properties of immobilised molecular layers, the Kretschmann geometry of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method was utilised. Density of fibrinogen bound to the surface depended on the concentration of fibrinogen in solution during the adsorption process. A fibrinogen monolayer was always formed. Fibrinogen in solution did not bind to surface-bound fibrinogen. Bound fibrinogen converted by thrombin to fibrin monomer interacted (rather slowly) with fibrinogen in solution. The rate of adsorption depended upon immobilised fibrin monomer density, fibrinogen concentration in solution, and on the presence of calcium ions. At low fibrin monomer density, the second layer was formed that contained about the same amount of protein as the first layer, at higher fibrin monomer concentration less than one molecule of fibrinogen per molecule of fibrin monomer was captured.

Here we demonstrate that the rate of tissue spreading over a two-dimensional substratum reflects a competition or ""tug-of-war"" between cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesions. We have generated both a ""library"" of structurally related copolymeric substrata varying in their adhesivity to cells and a library of genetically engineered cell populations varying only in cohesivity. Cell-substratum adhesivity was varied through the poly(ethylene glycol) content of a series of copolymeric substrata, whereas cell-cell cohesivity was varied through the expression of the hemophilic cohesion molecules Nand R-cadherin by otherwise noncohesive L929 cells. In the key experiment, multicellular aggregates containing about 600 cells were allowed to spread onto copolymeric surfaces. We compared the spreading behavior of aggregates having different levels of cell-cell cohesivity on a series of copolymeric substrata having different levers of cell-substratum adhesivity. In these experiments, cell-cell cohesivity was measured by tissue surface tensiometry, and cell-substratum adhesivity was assessed by a distractive method. Tissue spreading was assayed by confocal microscopy as the rate of cell emigration from similar-sized, fluorescence-labeled, multicellular aggregates deposited on each of the substrata. We demonstrate that either decreasing substratum adhesivity or increasing cell-cell cohesivity dramatically slowed the spreading rate of cell aggregates.","Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Steinberg, MS (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",msteinberg@princeton.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [HD30345]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM39455],,,38,156,158,0,19,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Fast neutron activation is appropriate for non-destructive analysis. Thermal neutron activation can evaluate trace elements as a reference. Proton-induced X-rays emission is applied to cartography of heavy elements. If necessary, proton-induced gamma -rays emission and charged particles scattering are suitable For evaluation and cartography of light elements.

The current in vitro study was designed to investigate such a feasibility on a collagen-coated heparin-bonded graft and to evaluate cell detachment upon pulsatile shear stress. Materials and methods: Endothelial cells (EA-hy-926) were seeded onto grafts. The endothelialization of the grafts was evaluated by the [H-3]-thymidine incorporation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological examinations. After in situ EC radiolabeling with a novel Tc-99m technique, the prostheses were exposed to pulsatile shear stress (0.27 N/m(2)), mimicking the shear rate occurring in a superficial femoral artery, for 3 h in a flow circuit and EC loss quantified by gamma camera detection. Results: Complete EC coverage was achieved after 5 days. Three hours of artificial perfusion resulted in a low EC loss (12.9 +/- 0.8 %, n = 7). SEM shows EC withstanding shear stress in valleys of prosthesis circumvolutions. Conclusions: These satisfactory results could be explained by the high affinity of EC For heparinized surfaces in addition to cell surface receptors involved in adhesion to collagen.

The water adsorption and desorption characteristics of these polymers were measured in water and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The desorption diffusion coefficients were higher than the adsorption coefficients in both water and PBS. Linear relationships between the equilibrium mass of water taken up and the mass of water desorbed with the concentration of HEMA in the polymer were established. Polymer surfaces were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface features varied with polymer composition; during hydration only selective areas of the surface hydrated indicating a heterogeneous surface. Contact angle data showed no trend between the different polymers indicating that contact angles are not an acceptable method of assessing hydrophobicity/wettability of a material which does not have a homogeneous surface. The effect of these bulk and surface characteristics on biological interactions were examined using bovine chondrocytes and human osteoblast (HOB) cell cultures. Cell attachment decreased when HEMA was present in the copolymer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Air-dried films were submitted to treatment with GTA solutions at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 wt%. At the smallest GTA concentration, the crosslinking degree, determined by trinitrobenzensulfonic acid assay, amounts to about 60% and increases up to values near 100%, obtained with GTA concentrations greater than or equal to 1 wt%. Simultaneously, the deformability of the films decreases, whereas the stress at break, sigma (b), and the Young's modulus, E, increase. A crosslinking degree of about 85%, obtained using 0.25% GTA, is enough to prevent gelatin release in buffer solution and to provoke a significant reduction of the swelling in physiological solution. Furthermore, crosslinking greatly affects the thermal stability of the samples, as indicated by the results of differential scanning calorimetry (d.s.c.) investigation carried out on wet and air-dried films. The data suggest that the use of GTA at low concentration, which is desiderable to prevent toxicity, allows to modulate the physico-chemical properties of gelatin films, in order to obtain stable materials with a wide range of possible biomedical applications.

A critical barrier to their use as load-bearing tissue replacements is a lack of sufficient mechanical properties. The purpose of this study was to characterize the functional compressive and shear mechanical properties of a novel PVA hydrogel. Two formulations of the biomaterial were tested, one with a lower water content (75% water), and the other with higher water content (80% water). The compressive tangent modulus varied with biomaterial formulation and was found to be statistically strain magnitude and rate dependent. Over a strain range of 10-60%, the compressive modulus increased from approximately 1-18 MPa, which is within the range of the modulus of articular cartilage. The shear tangent modulus (0.1-0.4 MPa) was also found to be strain magnitude dependent and within the range of normal human articular cartilage, but it was not statistically dependent on strain rate. This behavior was attributed to the dominance of fluid flow and related frictional drag on the viscoelastic behavior. Compressive failure of the hydrogels was found to occur between 45 and 60% strain, depending on water content.

Composites were prepared by hot pressing mixtures of these powders at 80 kpsi and 300 degreesC for 30 min. Composite formation was investigated depending on the proportions of reactants and the processing route used. Two inorganic phases were produced as a result of the acid-base reaction between TetCP and PVPA: hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2), HAp) and anhydrous dicalcium phosphate (CaHPO4, DCPA). The later phase preferentially formed at lower TetCP/PVPA ratios while the amount of HAp increased with increasing TetCP/PVPA ratio. The reactions appear to start with the softening of the polymer when heated to T > T-g. The flowing polymer surrounds the TetCP grains permitting the TetCP to initially form DCPA crystallites in a matrix of the Ca salt of the polymer.

In the present study the adhesion, viability and apoptotic changes in material surface adherent monocytes during the first hours of cell-surface interactions in vitro were studied, using tissue culture polystyrene surfaces coated with human albumin and fibrinogen. Human peripheral blood monocytes were enriched by a two-step gradient centrifugation and resuspended (1 x 10(6)/ml) in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were added to polystyrene surfaces coated with human fibrinogen or albumin and incubated in 37 degreesC (5% CO2, 100% humidity) for 30 min, 1, 2, 3 and 24 h. The adherent cells were stained for early apoptotic changes (exposed phosphatidylserine) and cell death using Annexin-V-fluorescein and propidium iodide staining, respectively. A bi-phasic adhesion was observed on the fibrinogen coated surface, having the highest number of adherent cells after 30 min and 24 h, while the cell number was markedly reduced after 1-3 h. The number of adherent cells on albumin was relatively low after all short time incubations but had reached a high level after 24 h. The number of adherent dead cells was highest after 1 h on both albumin (similar to 30%) and fibrinogen (similar to 15%). In the 24 h cultures, the viability of adherent cells was high on both surfaces (95-100%). Viable cells staining positive for early apoptotic changes could only be clearly observed on the albumin coated surface, after 30 min of cell-material surface interaction. Cell death, including apoptotic death, thus seems to play an important role during the initial interactions between monocytes and a foreign surface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We demonstrate a met hod to overcome this problem, by attaching the peptide to poly(L-lysine) (PLL), which immobilizes the sequence through adsorption at the poly(alpha -hydroxyacid) surface. When coated using a 0.01% w/v solution of PLL-GRGDS, bovine aortic endothelial cells seeded upon the modified PLA showed a marked increase in spreading over unmodified PLA. However, inhibition of the cell-spreading effect occurred when using higher concentrations of PLL-GRGDS, which we attribute to the PLL component. This inhibitory effect can be challenged by increasing the amount of GRGDS attached to each PLL molecule. Potentially, this is a flexible method of surface modification that can engineer many different types of tissue engineering scaffolds with a variety of biomolecules, thus allowing initial cell adhesion to be controlled.

The scaffold plays a central role in the creation of 3-D structures in cardiovascular tissue engineering like small vessels or heart valve prosthesis. An ideal scaffold should have tissue-like mechanical properties and a complete immunologic integrity. As an alternative scaffold the use of fibrin gel was investigated. Methods: Preliminary the degradation of the fibrin gel nas controlled by the supplementation of aprotinin to the culture medium. To prevent tissue from shrinking a mechanical fixation of the gel with 3-D microstructure culture plates and a chemical fixation with poly-L-lysine in different fixation techniques were studied. The thickness of the gel layer was changed from 1 to 3 mm. The tissue development was analysed by light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Collagen production was detected by the measurement of hydroxyproline. Injection molding techniques were designed for the formation of complex 3-D tissue structures. Results: The best tissue development was observed at an aprotinin concentration of 20 mug per cc culture medium. The chemical border fixation of the gel by poly-L-lysine showed the best tissue development. Up to a thickness of 3 mm no nutrition problems were observed in the light and transmission electron microscopy. The molding of a simplified valve conduit was possible by the newly developed molding technique. Conclusion: Fibrin gel combines a number of important properties of an ideal scaffold. It can be produced as a complete autologous scaffold. It is moldable and degradation is controllable by the use of aprotinin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These substitutes contained autogenetic growth stimulators including osteoblasts and other multipotential cells. One month later, they were transferred to the segmental bone defect sites created in femoral diaphysis of the same animals. The roentgenograms showed that in time the boundaries between the cylinders and bone sections became vague. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the spectra of the samples tended to be similar to those of natural bones by 6 months postoperatively. Their bending strengths also increased gradually. After the cylinders were transferred from muscles to the bone defect sites, newly formed bone tissues rapidly increased and the cylinders gradually fused with the contacted bones 2 months later. By 4 and 6 months, bone tissue occupied most areas of the materials. The ratio of newly formed bone tissue had a large lead over the materials. Haversian systems were clearly observed and matured bone tissues filled the ceramic pores and connected with each other. Results suggested that culturing complexes that consist of autogenetic periostea and biomaterials, taking advantage of living organic culturing medium, should be an effective approach to get satisfactory bioactive bone substitutes. It also provides a basis for clinically repairing bone defects in bearing sites with complex bioceramics.

To determine the cytotoxic and bioactive effects of these biomaterials, the cell-viability, metabolic activity, apoptotic properties, and DNA-synthesis activity were measured with four types of assays [Neutral Red, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, apoptotic activity, and tritiated thymidine incorporation assays] using extract and direct contact methods. Most of the biomaterials tested did not induce significant cytotoxic effects and exhibited normal metabolic function and cell growth in vitro.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that adhesion in anchorage-dependent cells is mediated in vitro by adsorption of serum proteins [particularly proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin and vitronectin] present in the growth medium. Specifically, adhesion has been shown to occur hen ECM proteins attach to the substratum and act as ligands for specific receptors located on the surface of cells. K562 cells are human erythroleukemic cells that normally grow in suspension. These cells are not involved in the same cell adhesion processes as anchorage-dependent cells and do not need to be attached to ECM proteins in order to survive and grow. Thus, with these systems, it is possible to better determine the role of protein adsorption in the adhesion of cells, growing in suspension such as blood cells, onto charged surfaces. The results presented show that adhesion of K562 cells onto the positively charged polylysine surface in the presence of serum is mediated through specific interactions between fibronectin receptors present on K562 cells and fibronectin adsorbed onto that cationic surface. Specifically, determination of cell adhesion under different experimental conditions indicates that nonspecific charge interactions do not take place directly between the cells and polylysine, but rather take place between polylysine and fibronectin, which adsorbs onto the cationic polymer. In addition, flow cytometric analyses reveal that only fibronectin receptors are present on these cells and, consequently, only fibronectin can be responsible for the actual adhesion of these cells onto the cationic surface. In view of the data presented, the possibility should be considered that ECM components adsorbed onto surfaces with specific charges and/or belonging to certain functional groups are involved in structural and functional modifications in cells. These cells grow in suspension and are normally not involved in adhesion phenomena, though these components should be considered. These considerations should be made especially when designing biomaterials that can modulate the response of cells growing in suspension, such as blood cells, and also in tissue engineering of blood substitutes.

This accelerated bone resorption could be due to increased osteoclastic activity, survival, or differentiation. Although a number of in vitro studies have shown that wear particles increase osteoclastic activity, the increase was less than twofold in all cases. The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that wear particles stimulate bone resorption by inducing osteoclast differentiation. Methods: Conditioned media were prepared from murine marrow cells or human peripheral blood monocytes incubated in the presence or absence of titanium particles. The effects of conditioned media on osteoclast differentiation were examined with use of a recently developed assay in which osteoclast precursors are co-cultured with mesenchymal support cells. Results: The present study showed that titanium particles induced both murine marrow cells and human peripheral blood monocytes to produce factors that stimulated osteoclast differentiation. The mean increase in osteoclast differentiation was 29.3 +/- 9.4-fold. The stimulation of osteoclast differentiation led to a parallel increase in bone resorption. The amount of stimulation was regulated in a dose-dependent manner by the concentration of both titanium particles and conditioned media. The stimulation of osteoclast differentiation required interactions between the cells and the particles themselves and, therefore, was not due to metal ions, soluble contaminants released from the particles, or submicrometer particles. In contrast, conditioned media from control cells incubated in the absence of titanium particles had no detectable effect on any of the examined parameters. Conclusions: The present study showed that titanium particles stimulate in vitro bone resorption primarily by inducing osteoclast differentiation. In contrast, the titanium particles had only small effects on osteoclast activity or survival. Clinical Relevance: The present study provides strong support for the hypothesis that osteoclast differentiation is an important factor in the development of aseptic loosening.

While numerous studies have evaluated the cellular response to particulate biomaterials, few have investigated the influence of movement of the implant on the biological response to particles. Our aim was therefore to test the hypothesis that excessive mechanical stimulation of the periprosthetic tissues induces an inflammatory response and that the addition of particulate biomaterials intensifies this. We allocated 66 adult Beagle dogs to four groups as follows: stable implants with (I) and without (II) particulate polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and moving implants with (III) and without (IV) particulate PMMA, They were then evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The stable implants were well tolerated and a thin, fibrous membrane of connective tissue was observed. There was evidence of positive staining in some cells for interleukin-6 (IL-6), Addition of particulate PMMA around the stable implants resulted in an increase in the fibroblastic response and positive staining for IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). By contrast, movement of the implant resulted in an immediate inflammatory response characterised by large numbers of histiocytes and cytokine staining for IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6, Introduction of particulate PMMA aggravated this response. Animals with particulate PMMA and movement of the implant have an intense inflammatory response associated with accelerated bone loss. Our results indicate that the initiation of the inflammatory response to biomaterial particles was much slower than that to gross mechanical instability. Furthermore, when there was both particulate debris and movement, there was an amplification of the adverse tissue response as evidenced by the presence of osteolysis and increases in the presence of inflammatory cells and their associated cytokines.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Baltimore, MD 21239 USA","Jones, LC (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Suite 201,Good Samaritan Profess Bldg, Baltimore, MD 21239 USA.",,,,NIEHS NIH HHS [ES 07141],,,78,34,35,0,2,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",0301-620X,2044-5377,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

However, tumor cells profoundly differ from normal tissue cells and monocytes are only precursors of macrophages. It has become possible to generate recently, under adherent-free conditions, fully mature macrophages and dendritic cells from human blood monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and GM-CSF + IL4 respectively. In the present work, we examined the effects of titanium-alloy on morphology, adhesion, cell phenotype and TNF-alpha release activity of such differentiated cells grown in hydrophobic teflon bags. Scanning electron microscopy showed that macrophages substantially adhered and spread on titanium-alloy surface throughout the culture period, whereas only a few dendritic cells were adherent. The phenotype of both cell types remained unchanged in the presence of the tested material. However, titanium-alloy stimulated the secretion of TNF-alpha by the macrophages of some donors. This model of culture may offer new insights into the biomaterial evaluation and may be useful for studying individual responses induced by biomaterials.

The same cells cultured on tissue culture-treated polystyrene without biomaterials were tested as the negative control; the same cells incubated with LPS were the positive control. The level of IL-6 in the conditioned medium was tested by enzyme immunoassay; the mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR with specific primers. The cultures incubated with C-PET produced non significantly different amount of IL-6 compared to the negative control and did not induce the expression of IL-6 specific mRNA. LPS induced a significantly higher release of IL-6 in the medium and the expression of mRNA after 24, 48 and 72 h.

Our composites are produced with different amounts (10 to 50% by weight) of the reinforcement by two procedures: bi-axial rotating drum and twin screw extrusion (TSE). The processing is by conventional injection molding and by Scorim (shear controlled orientation in injection molding) under a wide range of processing windows. Tensile testing is performed and the corresponding performance related to the morphology evaluated by polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The control of the processing parameters led to significant improvements of the tensile properties. Compounding by TSE and then processing by Scorim produces the maximum modulus of 7.4 GPa and the ductility as high as 19%, for the HA weight fraction of 30%. These mechanical properties match those of bone, and were obtained with much smaller amounts of HA reinforcement then has been previously reported in literature. Our PE + HA composites present the additional benefit of being ductile even for 50% HA amounts. The use Scorim is a unique way of inducing anisotropy to thick sections and to produce very stiff composites that may be used in biomedical applications with important mechanical loads. This fact, combined with the bioactive behavior of the HA phase, makes our composite usable for orthopedic load-bearing implants.","Univ Minho, Dept Polymer Engn, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; Brunel Univ, Wolfson Ctr Mat Proc, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England","Reis, RL (reprint author), Univ Minho, Dept Polymer Engn, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",,"Reis, Rui L./A-8938-2008; Group, 3Bs/E-4374-2012","Reis, Rui L./0000-0002-4295-6129; Group, 3Bs/0000-0002-5195-3456",,,,31,27,29,0,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1432-8917,,,MATER RES INNOV,Mater.

Polarization resistance, R-p, at open-circuit potential, E-open, and pitting potential, E-pit, were determined from the polarization curve. Compositions of passive film generated in a pH-7.5 solution with various concentrations of DO were characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In the solution with pH 7.5, the Epit decreased with the increase in logarithm of Cl- concentration, [Cl-], and showed the highest value with the same DO concentration, [DO], as that in viva. The concentrations of hydroxide group, [OH-], and phosphate ions, [HxPO4(3-x)-] in the passive film were changed with various [DO]s, and the E-pit decreased with the increase in [OH-] and [HxPO4(3-x)-]. In the solution with pH 2.2, the E-pit was higher than the E-open with and without DO. Therefore, this alloy may be resistant to the pitting corrosion in vivo.","Natl Res Inst Met, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hiromoto, S (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Met, 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011; BAI, JIE/D-7448-2016",,,,,17,31,31,0,10,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

From a therapeutic perspective, a carrier matrix is required for the local delivery of these proteins to evoke a desired osteogenic effect. In view of the affinity of these proteins for hydroxyapatite, which may reflect the in vivo supramolecular assembly of bone proteins bound to both the extracellular matrix and the mineral component of bone, we investigated the efficacy of single applications of different doses of human osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1) adsorbed onto sintered porous hydroxyapatites for bone induction in orthotopic calvarial defects in 12 adult male baboons (Papio ursinus) and heterotopically in the rectus abdominis of four additional baboons. In orthotopic specimens, pretreatment of sintered porous hydroxyapatites with 100 mug of hOP-1 in 500 mul of 5 mM hydrochloric acid resulted in rapid and diffuse osteoinduction restricted within the porous spaces of the hydroxyapatite, as evaluated by histology and histomorphometry on day 30. Hydroxyapatites treated with 500 mug of hOP-1 showed a different pattern of bone formation and distribution on day 30 as compared with the lower dose of the recombinant morphogen. Although bone formation was extensive with the higher dose, it was found on the endocranial and pericranial aspects of the specimens, enveloping the implanted hydroxyapatite carrier, and the internal porous spaces were occupied by a rich vascular network without any bone formation. By 90 and 365 days after the implantation of both doses of hOP-1, however, there was remodelling and complete penetration of the newly induced bone within the available porous spaces. The combination of hOP-1 and hydroxyapatite also showed extensive bone formation in heterotopic specimens harvested from the rectus abdominis muscle of the baboon using doses of 5, 25, and 45 mug of hOP-1 per implant. These findings in the adult primate demonstrate extensive bone formation by hOP-1 adsorbed onto sintered porous hydroxyapatites and suggest that predictable osteogenesis in clinical contexts for treatment of craniofacial bone defects may be engineered using inorganic, nonimmunogenic, and carvable delivery systems that initiate osteogenesis with relatively low doses of recombinant osteogenic proteins, thus mimicking the macrostructure and microstructure of living bone.","Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Med, MRC, Bone Res Unit, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa; Stryker Bitoech, Johannesburg, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Med, MRC, Bone Res Unit, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,53,58,60,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0032-1052,,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

Results: We could not show significant differences of protein S100 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels between SMAR(X)T patients and the controls, but the incidence of neurological complications was exceptionally low. Although no statistically significant differences could be obtained for the MMST, the different pointloss between both groups trends toward a better cerebral performance in SMAR(X)T patients.

Two landmark studies have shown that stainless steel stents significantly decrease the restenosis rate as compared to balloon angioplasty. This fact led to a marked increase of stent implantation since the first stent implantation by Jacques Fuel in 1986. Although the concept of coronary stenting significantly improved the interventional therapy of coronary artery disease, restenosis remains a major unsolved drawback of this technique. In addition to procedure and disease related factors like implantation pressure and plaque burden, data suggest that the stent as a medical implant plays a crucial role in the process of neointima formation. Since its introduction in cardiology, more than 50 different stents of different configuration and material have been developed. Although recent publications report of promising results using biodegradable materials, almost all coronary stents commercially available at the moment are made of metallic alloys. Whereas first generation stents were made exclusively from stainless steel and only minor interest was focussed on the stent material in the manufacture of coronary stents, recent studies strongly suggest that the metallic alloy used has a direct impact on the extent of neointima formation. Thus, metallic alloys differ not only with respect to mechanical features, but also by their biocompatible properties. These two factors are of major importance in the induction of vessel wall injury, inflammatory processes and cell proliferation. In the first part, the present paper reviews the metallurgic characteristics of metallic materials, which are currently used or under investigation in the production of coronary stents.

There are basically two groups of polyesters which have significant importance in this field. These are polylactides and polyhydroxybutyrates. Both groups degrade via hydrolysis with the rates of degradation depending on medium properties such as pH, temperature, solvent and presence of biocatalysts, as well as on chemical compositions. In order for these biomaterials to be suitable for use in load bearing applications without deformation or warping their strengths and their capability to maintain their form must be improved. To insure dimensional stability during degradation and to match modulus and strength to that of bone, introduction of a reinforcing structure for those applications to plate fixation through the creation of an interpenetrating network might be a feasible approach. In this study, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), was the major structural element to be strengthened by a three-dimensional network or 'scaffold' of another biodegradable polymer, poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF). PPF would be crosslinked with a biocompatible vinyl monomer, vinylpyrrolidone (VP). Three different approaches were tested to create dimensionally stable bone plates. First, via in situ crosslinking of PPF in the presence of PLGA. Secondly, by blending of precrosslinked PPF with PLGA. Finally, by simultaneous crosslinking and molding of the PLGA, PPF and VP. These were compared against extruded or compression molded PLGA controls. Results showed that compression molding at room temperature followed by crosslinking under pressure at elevated temperature and subsequently by gamma -irradiation appeared to yield the most favorable product as judged by swelling, hardness and flexural strength data. The composition of the implant material, PLGA(3):PPF(1):VP(0.7), appeared to be suitable and formed the compositional and procedural basis for in vivo biocompatibility studies.

To explore the possibility of fabricating novel two-dimensional protein layers, we studied the self-assembly properties of de novo proteins from a designed combinatorial library. Each protein in the library has a distinct 63 amino acid sequence, yet they all share an identical binary pattern of polar and nonpolar residues, which was designed to favor the formation of six-stranded amphiphilic beta -sheets, Characterization of proteins isolated from the library demonstrates that (i) they self assemble into monolayers at an air/water interface; (ii) the monolayers are dominated by beta -sheet secondary structure, as shown by both circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopies; and (iii) the measured areas (500- 600 Angstrom (2)) Of individual protein molecules in the monolayers match those expected for proteins folded into amphiphilic beta -sheets, The finding that similar structures are formed by distinctly different protein sequences suggests that assembly into beta -sheet monolayers can be encoded by binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids. Moreover, because the designed binary pattern is compatible with a wide variety of different sequences, it may be possible to fabricate beta -sheet monolayers by using combinations of side chains that are explicitly designed to favor particular applications of novel biomaterials.","Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Groves, JT (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,31,77,77,1,19,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Its use has been shown to benefit premature infants and patients with severe respiratory distress, but a vital question concerns ventilator-induced damage to the lung tissue, and a clear protocol for the most effective treatment has not been identified. Mathematical modeling can help in understanding the mechanical effects of lung ventilation, and hence in establishing such a protocol. In this paper we describe the use of homogenization theory to predict the macroscopic behavior of lung tissue based upon the three dimensional microstructure of respiratory regions, making the simplifying assumption that the microstructure is periodic. This approach yields equations for macroscopic air ow, pressure, and tissue deformation, with parameters which can be determined from a specification of the tissue microstructure and its material properties. We are able to include an alternative hypothesis as to the dependence of lung tissue shear viscosity on the frequency of forcing, known as the structural damping hypothesis. We then show how, if we consider isotropic tissue, the parameters determining the macroscopic response of the tissue can be estimated from bulk measurements. Finally, we consider the solutions of the macroscopic system when we consider variations in just one spatial dimension. In particular, we demonstrate that the structural damping hypothesis leads to markedly different solution behavior.","Univ Utah, Dept Math, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Owen, MR (reprint author), Univ Loughborough, Dept Math Sci, Nonlinear & Complex Syst Grp, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",,"Lewis, Mark/A-2659-2014; Lewis, Mark/C-5015-2008; Owen, Markus/F-3082-2011","Owen, Markus/0000-0002-3028-9138",,,,24,19,19,0,3,SIAM PUBLICATIONS,PHILADELPHIA,"3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA",0036-1399,,,SIAM J APPL MATH,SIAM J.

This process results in the formation of a nanoporous sponge composed almost entirely of the more noble alloy constituents(1). Although considerable attention has been devoted to the morphological aspects of the dealloying process, its underlying physical mechanism has remained unclear(2). Here we propose a continuum model that is fully consistent with experiments and theoretical simulations of alloy dissolution, and demonstrate that nanoporosity in metals is due to an intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process. That is, pores form because the more noble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters by a phase separation process (spinodal decomposition) at the solid-electrolyte interface, and the surface area continuously increases owing to etching. Together, these processes evolve porosity with a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum model. We expect that chemically tailored nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au should be suitable for sensor applications, particularly in a biomaterials context.","Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Northeastern Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Arizona State Univ, Ctr Solid State Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Erlebacher, J (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,"Erlebacher, Jonah/A-3231-2010; Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/C-5716-2011","Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/0000-0003-3528-3824",,,,25,1640,1670,56,871,MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,MAR 22,2001.0,410,6827,,,,,450,453,,10.1038/35068529,,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,412YX,WOS:000167583800036,11260708.0,,,,2019-02-25

It was found that the flexibility and degradability of the cast films of the block copolymers grew with increasing Pluronic(R) F68 [PN; poly(oxyethylene-co-oxypropylene] composition. The receding contact angle of the copolymer films against water became lower than that of the PLLA film, because the surface was predominantly covered with more hydrophilic PN segments in a wet state. This surface property significantly affects the cell attachment property of the copolymer films, and the fibroblasts cultured on the films exhibit a spheroid like morphology. The copolymer films subcutaneously implanted in the back of rats induced milder tissue responses compared with PLLA homopolymers, because of the increased surface hydrophilicity in the former. In vivo evaluation using a uterus horn model in rats revealed that the performance of these copolymer films as an adhesion-prevention membrane is comparable to that of a conventionally utilized membrane of oxidized regenerated cellulose. These results indicate that the copolymer films are biocompatible materials with controllable mechanical properties and biodegradability as adhesion-prevention membranes.

However, difficulties are frequently encountered in characterizing the adsorbed layer due to conformational changes in the molecules following adsorption al td interference from nonspecifically adsorbed molecules. In this study, we have investigated a technique for covalently immobilizing fibronectin to the PEG-containing triblock copolymer Pluronic(TM) F108 (""F108""). We have compared this technique to solution adsorption of fibronectin for its ability to provide controlled variation of bound fibronectin and regulation of fibroblast behavior. Both simple adsorption and covalent immobilization were effective for varying substrate-bound fibronectin. However, adsorption of fibronectin did not effectively regulate fibroblast attachment or spreading in either serum-free or serum-containing media. Fibroblast attachment, spreading, cytoskeletal organization, and proliferation were effectively regulated in response to fibronectin immobilized to F108. Furthermore, F108-treated surfaces without immobilized fibronectin did not support nonspecific fibroblast attachment, even in the presence of serum-containing medium. Fibroblasts were observed to only proliferate on surfaces with high levels of immobilized fibronectin that supported extensive cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization. In summary, covalent immobilization of fibronectin to F108 provided controlled regulation of fibroblast behavior without interference from nonspecific protein adsorption, even in the presence of serum-containing medium.

In this study, dry spinning was used to prepare the sol-gel fibers, which were heat-treated at 175 degrees and 250 degreesC. In addition, the differences in the surface topography (in a nanometer scale) of different fibers with respect to their in vitro bioactivity were studied. The structure of the fibers was varied using three different factors: (1) spinnable sols having varying structures and sizes of silica polymers to establish varying viscosity levels; (2) aging of green-state fibers; and (3) heat treatment of fibers. The in vitro bioactivity and solubility tests were done in simulated body fluid (SBF). To monitor surface topography and roughness of the heat-treated silica fibers, a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with tapping mode AFM was used. Different fibers obtained clearly different properties. The fibers spun at about eta > 3.0 Pas had the best properties with respect to bioactivity, especially when they were heat-treated at 175 degreesC. It was found that surface structure in a nanometer scale was the most important factor controlling the in vitro bioactivity of heat-treated silica fibers. The correct proportions between the peaks and peak distances at the surfaces are suggested to be important with respect to in vitro bioactivity. The results indicate that peak distance distribution between 5-50 nm, especially between 5-20 nm, together with a peak height greater than or equal to1 nm is most favorable for calcium phosphate formation.

The aim was to generate compounds having lowest toxicity for determining the pharmacological structure-function relationships among different backbone structures and differently arranged functional groups compared to those of heparin and heparan sulfate. The water-soluble starting material, chitosan, with a degree of acetylation (DA) of 0.14 and a molecular weight of 29 kD, allows one to apply most of the known reactions of chitosan as well as some reactions of heparin chemistry successfully and with improved regioselectivity and completeness. On the other hand, a number of these reactions were not successful by application to water-soluble high-molecular-weight chitosan (DA 0.45 and 150 kD). The starting material showed statistical N-acetyl (N-Ac) distribution along the polymer chain according to the rules of Bernoulli, with highest abundance of the GlcNAc-GlcNAc diad along with a lower abundance of triads, tetrads, and pentads. The space between the N-Ac groups was filled up in homogeneous reactions by N-sulfo and/or N-carboxymethyl groups, which also resulted in a Bernoulli statistical distribution. The N-substitution reaction showed highest regioselectivity and completeness with up to three combined different functional groups. The regioselectivity of the 3-O-sulfo groups was improved by regioselective 6-desulfation of nearly completely sulfated 3,6-di-O-sulfochitosan.

Western blotting is one of the options to characterize protein expression in cell populations. Method transfer to biomaterial model systems is not trivial because of the structure that exists in many biomaterials, preventing the collection of cell lysate by mechanical means. In this technical resort, we describe the influence of different protein collection methods in a model system for cell-biomaterial interactions, consisting of endothelial cells exposed to different stimuli. In particular, the influence of trypsinization before lysis, and handling complexity were determined. The results of this study indicate that many changes in proteins occur because of the intermediate enzymatic treatment, despite the use of ice-cold solutions and protease and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors throughout the procedure. Protein degradation and slight depressions in molecular weight were observed. The enzymatic treatment induced a changed cell status associated with detachment from the substratum. Western blotting of lysates of cells obtained through enzymatic harvest therefore can only be used with internal controls for the assessment of artifacts introduced by trypsinization, or alternative methods should be sought.

The recent advent of the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) enables insulating and/or moist specimens, even liquid mixtures, to be observed directly, without the need for conventional EM preparation techniques such as freezing/drying and metallic coating, This represents a significant technological advance, extending electron microscopic capabilities to the study of soft condensed matter and delicate specimens in their native states, in addition, in situ experiments may be carried out including mechanical deformation and the observation of dynamic processes such as wetting and swelling behaviour of materials, thermal responses, the effects of hydration, dehydration and rehydration, and film-formation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate and characterize surface alterations of retrieved inner face-bow headgear components. Specimens were prepared from 3 areas of retrieved headgear wires: inner-outer face-bow soldered junction, buccal segment, and projection entering the buccal tube. Specimens from as-received headgear wires that matched the brand and size of the retrieved wires were also fabricated; all specimens were then subjected to multitechnique characterization. Optical microscopy revealed extensive biofilm islands of amorphous precipitants and accumulated microcrystalline particles. Micro-multiple internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy investigation of the retrieved wire samples demonstrated the presence of a proteinaceous biofilm, the organic constituents of which were mainly amide, alcohol, and carbonate. Scanning electron microscopy and radiographic microanalysis showed that the elemental species precipitated on the material surface were mainly calcium and phosphorus, forming calcium-phosphorus precipitates with thicknesses reaching 300 mum, whereas radiograph fluorescence spectrometry provided evidence of integument calcification through identification of calcium and phosphorus peaks. The clinical implication of the aging pattern that was identified relates to the potential protective role or induction of disintegration by the biofilm adsorbed on the wire that affected the biocompatibility of the alloy. Whereas further investigation is suggested for the clarification of the effect of intraoral aging on ionic release, the results of this study emphasize the necessity for the incorporation of in vivo approaches, including retrieval analyses, in the study of the biologic performance of orthodontic materials.","Univ Manchester, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester, Lancs, England; Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Dent Mat, Athens, Greece","Eliades, T (reprint author), 57 Agnoston Hiroon St, GR-14231 Athens, Greece.",teliades@ath.forthnet.gr,"Eliades, Theodore/E-4959-2017","Eliades, Theodore/0000-0003-2313-4979; Watts, David/0000-0002-9105-2775",,,,27,13,13,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0889-5406,1097-6752,,AM J ORTHOD DENTOFAC,Am.

Cultured cells are seeded onto a three-dimensional biocompatible scaffold that will slowly degrade and resorb as the soft and hard structures grow and assimilate in vitro and/or in vivo. The 3-D scaffold provides the necessary template for cells to proliferate and maintain their differentiated state. Ultimately, it defines the overall shape of the tissue-engineered transplant. The aim of this review is to describe and discuss the scaffold materials of natural and synthetic origin that are of specific interest to tissue engineers. This review is based oil previous publications and our own experience in the use of biomaterials of natural and synthetic origin for tissue engineering applications. Biodegradable polymers which have been used for tissue engineering applications are mainly based on clinically established medical devices and implants. In the group of macromolecules of natural origin collagen, alginate, agarose, hyaluronic acid derivatives, chitosan, and fibrin glue have been used as scaffolds. Man-made polymers such as polyglycolide (PGA), polylactides (PLLA, PDLA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(dioxanone) (PDS) have been studied as matrix material to guide the differentiation and proliferation of cells into the targeted functional premature and/or mature tissue. Appropriate selection of scaffold material with respect to the targeted tissue is essential. Today, biomaterials of choice remain to be those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In spite of that, novel biomaterials should be developed specifically designed for tissue engineering applications.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Orthoped Surg, Singapore 119074, Singapore; Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn, Biomed Engn Lab, Singapore 119074, Singapore","Goh, JCH (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Orthoped Surg, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119074, Singapore.",dosgohj@nus.edu.sg,,"Hutmacher, Dietmar Werner/0000-0001-5678-2134",,,,62,156,161,1,56,ACAD MEDICINE SINGAPORE,REPUBLIC SINGAPORE,"142 NEIL RD, REPUBLIC SINGAPORE 088871, SINGAPORE",0304-4602,,,ANN ACAD MED SINGAP,Ann.

Fresh and cryopreserved allografts were compared with synthetic prostheses made of various biomaterials including PTFE, plain Dacron, gelatine-sealed Dacron, and gelatine-sealed, rifampicine-bonded Dacron. Allografts were used with or without treatment using an antibiotic containing gentamycine, lincomycine, and vancomycine. The bacterial strains tested were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, non-slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection was evaluated by counting the number of adherent bacteria on the allograft or synthetic material after rinsing and ultrasonication. Statistical analysis was achieved using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. Results showed that allografts not treated with antibiotics were highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Antibiotic treatment decreased infection. Application of antibiotic after thawing cryopreserved allografts led to a significant decrease. None of the biomaterials tested provided sufficient protection against bacteria resistant to the antibiotics used.","CHU La Miletrie, Serv Chirurg Vasc, F-86021 Poitiers, France; Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Banque Tissus Humains, Hop St Louis, Paris, France; Univ Paris, Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Chirurg Vasc, Paris, France","Camiade, C (reprint author), CHU La Miletrie, Serv Chirurg Vasc, 350 Ave Jacques Coeur, F-86021 Poitiers, France.",,,,,,,24,22,24,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0890-5096,,,ANN VASC SURG,Ann.

The synthesis and spectroscopic data (ESCA, FTIR) for the plasma polymerized NIPAM (ppNIPAM) shows a remarkable retention of the monomer structure. The phase transition at 29 degreesC was measured by a novel AFM method. The phase transition was surprising because of the expectation that the plasma environment would destroy the specific NIPAM structure associated with the thermal responsiveness. The phase change of ppNIPAM is also responsible for the changes in the level of the meniscus when coated capillaries are placed in warm and cold water. Plasma polymerization of NIPAM represents a one-step method to fabricate thermally responsive coatings on real-world biomaterials without the need for specially prepared substrates and functionalized polymers.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Elect Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ratner, BD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Box 351720, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR-01296],,,43,198,206,12,100,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,SPR,2001.0,2,1,,,,,32,36,,10.1021/bm0000642,,,,5,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,433JG,WOS:000168755800006,11749152.0,,,,2019-02-25

Combs comprised of a poly(methyl methacrylate) backbone and short poly(ethylene oxide) side chains were synthesized, and peptides were tethered to the side chain ends to create nanoscale peptide clusters. In thin films, comb polymers containing greater than or equal to 30 wt % six to nine unit PEO side chains completely resisted adhesion of a model fibroblast cell line in the presence of 7.5% serum over 24 h. These same polymers modified with RGD peptides elicited tunable cell adhesion when mixed with unmodified combs in varying proportion. A self-consistent field lattice model of the interface between comb polymer films and water predicts an organization of the top molecular layer of comb polymer with the backbone oriented parallel to the interface in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and hydrophilic side chains extended in a brushlike layer into solution. This picture of a quasi-2D configuration is consistent with the observed surface properties of comb films in water as well as measurements of the RGD cluster density on mixed comb surfaces using fluorescent nanosphere labeling of ligand clusters.","MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Div Bioengn & Environm Hlth, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Mayes, AM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [1R0GM59870-01],,,48,152,154,1,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,SPR,2001.0,2,1,,,,,85,94,,10.1021/bm005584b,,,,10,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,433JG,WOS:000168755800013,11749159.0,,,,2019-02-25

In order to maintain mechanical integrity of the tissue, the cells must generate sufficient extracellular matrix before the scaffold is degraded. We have previously shown that materials containing cell adhesive ligands to promote or improve cell adhesion can decrease extracellular matrix production (Mann et al.. Modification of surfaces with cell adhesion peptides alters extracellular matrix deposition. Biomaterials 1999:20:2281-6). Such decreased matrix production by cells in tissue engineering scaffolds may result in tissue failure. However. we have found that TGF-beta1 can be used in scaffolds to dramatically increase matrix production. Matrix production by vascular smooth muscle cells grown on adhesive ligand-modified glass surfaces and in PEG hydrogels containing covalently bound adhesive ligands was increased in the presence of 0.04 pmol/ml (1 ng/ml) TGF-beta1, TGF-beta1 can counteract the effect of these adhesive ligands on matrix production; matrix production could be increased even above that observed in the absence of adhesive peptides. Further, TGF-beta1 covalently immobilized to PEG retained its ability to increase matrix production. Tethering TGF-beta1 to the polymer scaffold resulted in a significant increase in matrix production over the same amount of soluble TGF-beta1. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thermally triggerable liposomes were designed by entrapping CaCl2 within liposomes constructed of 90% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 10% dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. These liposomes released greater than 90% of entrapped Ca2+ when heated to 37 degreesC. A precursor fluid containing liposomes suspended in aqueous sodium alginate remained fluid for several days at room temperature but gelled rapidly when heated to 37 degreesC. as a result of Ca2+ release and formation of crosslinked Ca-alginate. Alternatively, thermally triggered Ca2+ release from liposomes was used to activate enzyme-catalyzed crosslinking of proteins to form hydrogels. A mixture of Ca-loaded liposomes, fibrinogen, and a Ca2+-dependent transglutaminase enzyme (either human recombinant FXIII or guinea pig liver transglutaminase) remained fluid indefinitely when stored at room temperature. but gelled rapidly when heated to 37 degreesC. SDS-PAGE of the reaction mixture revealed that gelation was due to enzymatic crosslinking of the alpha and gamma chains of fibrinogen, and oscillating rheometry revealed gel formation within 10 min of heating to 37 degreesC. This new approach may be useful for developing rapidly gelling injectable biomaterials that can be stored at room temperature and injected in a minimally invasive manner into a body tissue or cavity, upon which rapid solidification would occur. This versatile bioinspired strategy could be utilized for the delivery of biomaterials for tissue repair and reconstruction. and local site-directed drug delivery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The present study was intended to characterize the surface properties of a genipin-fixed biological tissue immobilized with heparin using the methods of ionic binding (the /h-i tissue) or covalent binding via multi-point attachment (the /h-m tissue) or end-point attachment (the /h-e tissue). The surface characteristics of test tissues evaluated were water contact angle, surface tension, protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, and cellular compatibility. Nonheparinized and the glutaraldehyde-fixed counterparts were used as controls. It was found that immobilization of heparin on the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues increased their hydrophilicity and surface tension and suppressed their mole ratio of adsorbed fibrinogen to adsorbed albumin and the amount of platelets adhered. Among the heparinized tissues, the /h-m tissue was more hydrophobic and had a higher mole ratio of adsorbed fibrinogen to adsorbed albumin and a greater amount of platelets adhered than the /h-i and /h-e tissues. In general, the surface characteristics of the /h-i tissue were comparable to the /h-e tissue. However, it is known that the ionically immobilized heparin may be displaced from the surface by an ion-exchange mechanism when exposed to blood. There were no significant differences in hydrophilicity, surface tension, the mole ratio of adsorbed fibrinogen to adsorbed albumin, and the amount of platelet adhesion between the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues in comparison with their respective counterparts. However, the cellular compatibility of the genipin-fixed tissues with or without heparinization was significantly superior to its glutaraldehyde-fixed counterparts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The biocomposite was implanted into Balb/c Singen mice and after 1 and 3 weeks removed from their organisms and analyzed by the FT-IR spectroscopy. After 1 week of testing in vivo the implanted sample gave a spectrum in which absorption bands arising from newly formed functional groups of amine and peptide can be seen. After 3 weeks, a spectrum with pronounced absorption bands at 3420 and 1650 cm(-1) assigned to newly generated collagen, a component of the extracellular connective-tissue matrix, was registered. Also, decrease of the intensity absorption band at 1760 cm(-1) originating from the C=O group of PLLA indicates bioresorption of the PLLA used. Analysis of the microstructure of the sample surface by scanning electron microscopy before and after implantation revealed bioresorption of the PLLA polymer phase and generation of collagen fibers at the sites of implanted bioresorptive PLLA. A mixture of autologous bone powder and HAp/PLLA biocomposite was also examined. After implantation, the same final products as in the case of HAp/PLLA composite biomaterial used alone were found.

Methods: In eight adult sheep, an infrarenal AAA was created transluminally by dilation of a short Palmaz stent. In six sheep, the aneurysm was then ruptured by overdilation of the stent with a large angioplasty balloon. Two sheep with AAAs that were not ruptured served as controls. A SIS Sandwich endograft, consisting of a Z stent frame with 5 bodies and covered inside and out with SIS, was used to exclude the ruptured and non-ruptured AAAs. Follow-up aortography was done immediately after the procedure and before sacrifice at 4, 8, or 12 weeks. Autopsy and histologic studies followed. Results: Endograft placement was successful in all eight sheep. Both ruptured and non-ruptured AAAs were successfully excluded. Three animals with AAA rupture developed hind leg paralysis due to compromise of the arterial supply to the lower spinal cord and were sacrificed 1 day after the procedure. In five animals, three with rupture and two controls, follow-up aortograms revealed no aortic stenoses and no perigraft leaks: Gross and histologic studies revealed incorporation of the endografts into the aortic wall with replacement of SIS by dense neointima that was completely endothelialized in areas where the endograft was in direct contact with the aortic wall. In central portions of the endograft, in contact with the thrombosed aneurysm, endothelialization was incomplete even at 12 weeks. Conclusion: The SIS Sandwich endografts effectively excluded simple AAAs and ruptured AAAs. They were rapidly incorporated into the aortic wall. A detailed long-term study is warranted.","Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dotter Intervent Inst, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Pavcnik, D (reprint author), Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dotter Intervent Inst, L342,3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",,,,,,,27,15,15,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0174-1551,,,CARDIOVASC INTER RAD,Cardiovasc.

A phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and two PBS/H2O2 solutions containing 50 and 150 mM of H2O2 were used to simulate the body fluids. The behaviour of the metal was monitored as a function of time by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for three weeks. After one week, the PBS/H2O2 solutions were replaced by fresh PBS solutions in order to simulate the end of the inflammatory process and recovery of the system. All the experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 37 degreesC. From the simulation of the experimental EIS spectra, it was concluded that the corrosion resistance of titanium is strongly affected by the presence of H2O2 and when the peroxide is removed, the metal displays a sharp resistance increase. Furthermore, the oxides formed in H2O2 are rougher and display higher ionic conductivities than the oxides Formed in the absence of peroxide. The study was complemented with potentiostatic experiments and scanning electron microscopy observation of the metal surfaces. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The paper specifically identifies the adhesion strength properties of diamond-like coatings and its dependence on process parameters for application to orthopaedic steels and polymer substrates. Sub-micron thickness films were deposited directly on stainless steel, cobalt chrome alloy, titanium alloy and ultra high mel. wt. polyethylene substrates. It was found from Rockwell and pull-off adhesion tests that superior adhesion is acquired for stainless steel substrates followed by cobalt chrome and titanium alloys. Adhesion strength was also shown to be inversely related to increases in deposition pressure and to increase with time up to a threshold. The maximum adhesion strength of coatings deposited on the polymer substrates was 60% of the value for stainless steel. Surface roughness was also inversely related to adhesion strength for the substrates examined. It is demonstrated that stainless steel offers a superior substrate material for the application of diamond-like thin-films where wear mechanisms and mechanical constraints are operational such as in orthopaedic articulating joint replacements.

A Western European systems engineering perspective,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,MARKAL; biomass; greenhouse gas policies,,"This paper discusses an assessment of the optimal use of biomass in Western Europe for the long term (2010-2030) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment is based on a linear programming model for the Western European energy and materials system, called MARKAL MATTER 4.2. The goal of the study was the comparison of the cost-effectiveness and the interactions between bioenergy, biomaterials and afforestation strategies in comparison to other greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies. The results suggest that the use of biomass for energy and materials applications will increase by up to 200 Mt (compared to the case with no permit price) if greenhouse gas policies are introduced. The main increase occurs in the production of transportation fuels and substitution of petrochemical feedstocks and electricity generation from waste and residues. Afforestation offers a cost-effective competing land-use strategy. The total contribution of biomass strategies is an emission reduction of up to 400 Mt CO2 equivalents (9% of 1990 emissions).

Design, materials and methods: twenty-four growing pigs were randomly divided into three groups. The infrarenal aorta was replaced by a segment of collagen-impregnated woven polyester prosthesis (low, medium and high porosity). Serum antibodies were detected by modified enzyme immunoassay using non-impregnated prosthesis as the target for the blood samples taken on experimental days 1, 10, 17, 24, 62 and 116 of the 22 pigs followed over the whole observation period.

Porcine and human cardiac valve leaflets were found to be a substrate favoring the deposition of vaterite crystals from stable supersaturated solution at pH 8.5 at 25 degreesC. The apparent order for vaterite crystallization reaction was found to be n = 1, suggesting a surface diffusion controlled mechanism. The crystallization was studied by the constant composition technique, thus making it possible for relatively large amounts of the overgrowth phase to be formed and identified exclusively as vaterite. Analysis of the initial rates of the reaction as a function of the solution supersaturation, according to the classical nucleation theory, yielded a value of 23.4 mJ m(-2) for the surface energy of the growing phase and a three-ion cluster forming the critical nucleus. A novel ""in vitro"" anticalcification process based on the treatment of porcine and human heart valves with sodium alginate has been developed. This anticalcification procedure reduced mineralization of porcine and human valves up to 53% and 45%, respectively.

A useful system to evaluate the angiogenic activity and the inflammatory potency of various agents is the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo. Here we examined its response to different biomaterials. Smooth materials such as PVC or the polyurethane Tecoflex(R) either unmodified or modified by an OH- or N(CH3)(3)(+)-end group (HEMA or MAPTAC) inhibited angiogenesis and did not induce the formation of granulation tissue. The anti-angiogenic effects of PVC, Tecoflex(R) and its HEMA modification, however, were only seen at an early stage of development. In contrast, the MAPTAC modified Tecoflex(R) inhibited angiogenesis over the whole time. Rough materials, e.g. filter paper or a collagen/elastin membrane, stimulated angiogenesis and induced the formation of inflammatory tissue. Histological analysis revealed that the filter material was homogeneously populated with cells consisiting mainly of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The collagen/elastin membrane was only partially infiltrated with cells. Among those also clusters of granulocytes were present pointing to an acute inflammatory process. These data show that the angiogenic activity and inflammatory response of biomaterials strongly depend on the chemical composition and the physical structure of the material. The CAM assay appears to be a useful tool for studying biocompatibility.

Such a measurement would provide the required experimental evidence for validating the postulated theory that the accumulation of acidic hydrolytic degradation products within the interior of aliphatic polyesters is responsible for the observed accelerated degradation of this class of absorbable biomaterials. This new technique used a laser scanning confocal microscope coupled with pH sensitive fluorescent dyes like Texas Red sulfonyl chloride. The capability of optical thin sectioning of a laser confocal microscope would permit a non-destructive examination of the interior of biomaterials. Poly-p-dioxanone suture fibers (PDSII) of size 2/0 were used as the model compound for this new technique. The pH values of the unhydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed PDSII fibers were found to decrease with increasing depth from the fiber surface and reached as low as about 3.5 at 70 mum depth. The largest depth that an interior pH could be measured within absorbable biomaterials was determined by the opacity of the biomaterials, i.e. a higher depth for a less opaque material. The observed interior pH profiles were correlated to the unique morphologic structure of PDSII fibers.

Utilizing a visible light photoinitiating system, these oligomers polymerize within minutes to form highly crosslinked networks and, thus, have potential for in situ formation. Varying the oligomer structure readily alters the physical properties of the resultant polymer networks. For instance, mechanical properties were highly dependent on the number of lactic acid and ethylene glycol units in the oligomer backbone. Additionally, polymer mass loss ranged from similar to 30 to 60% within 8 weeks of degradation time depending on the oligomer chemistry. Mechanical properties decreased with degradation of these polymers, indicating a bulk degradation mechanism. Finally, scaffolds with a controlled architecture were fabricated from these oligomers that show potential for tissue-engineering applications.

Heparin has anti-inflammatory effects and is often added to the peritoneal dialysis fluid to prevent fibrin formation. Conjugation of heparin to the surface of biomaterials has been shown to improve its biocompatibility. In this study, we describe for the first time an experimental chronic peritoneal dialysis model with repeated dwell studies in non-uraemic rats and evaluate the effect of addition of heparin to glucose-based peritoneal dialysis fluid on peritoneal fluid and solute transport. Methods. Wistar male rats, weighing 340 +/- 15 g, with implanted peritoneal catheters were infused during I month, twice per day with 20 ml of Dianeal 1.36%+antibiotics (AB; n = 10) or Dianeal 1.36% + antibiotics + heparin 2500 U/l (HAB; n = 9). After 10 (DS 1) and 30 days (DS 2), a dwell study was performed in rats with free access to drinking water, by infusing 30 mi of Dianeal 3.86%. Dialysate samples were obtained at 0, 2, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min. Blood samples were drawn before and at the end of the dwell. Radiolabelled serum albumin was used as macromolecular volume marker. Results. Peritoneal volumes during DS 1 were significantly greater for the HAB group as compared with the AB group. No differences in ultrafiltration were found during DS 2 for HAB vs AB. However, peritoneal volumes were significantly higher for DS 2 compared with DS I in the AB group. The amount of glucose absorbed over time did not differ between the solutions, while fluid absorption tended to be lower in the HAB group. Conclusions. Heparin may improve peritoneal fluid transport possibly due to better healing and reduced peritoneal inflammation as shown in this novel animal model of chronic peritoneal dialysis with repeated dwell studies.","Huddinge Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Div Baxter Novum, S-14186 Huddinge, Sweden; Huddinge Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Sci, Div Renal Med, S-14186 Huddinge, Sweden; Poznan Med Sch, Dept Pathophysiol, Poznan, Poland","Lindholm, B (reprint author), Huddinge Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Div Baxter Novum, K-56, S-14186 Huddinge, Sweden.",,"Waniewski, Jacek/A-6967-2008",,,,,16,28,28,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0931-0509,1460-2385,,NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL,Nephrol.

Hydrogels of Hyal have been obtained by cross-linking the free polysaccharide. An appropriate Hyal/cross-linking agent ratio has produced a hydrogel with a degree of crosslinking of 50%. In the present study, the ability to stimulate endothelial cell adhesion and migration teas evaluated for free Hyal, HyalS(3.5) and their complexes with Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions. The results revealed that Hyal and [Cu(OH)(2)HyalS(3.5)]((4.5))- induced cell adhesion, while [ZnHyalS(3.5)]((2.5))- and [Zn(OH)(2)HyalS(3.5)]((4.5))- inhibited the process. The chemotactic activity of increasing concentrations of the above complexes was also evaluated; demonstrating that [Cu(OH)(2)HyalS(3.5)]((4.5)-) complex at 1 muM concentration was the most active in inducing cell migration.

The simulation studies placed a particular emphasis on studying the oligopeptide in aqueous media, as well as in a grafted or immobilized state, The simulations revealed the presence of a stable double hydrogen bond between arginine (R) and aspartic acid (D) residues. The mutation of the terminal arginine with lysine, another hydrophilic and positively charged amino acid, resulted in a drastic structural change. thus suggesting a major role of the terminal arginine residue in the overall oligopeptide's conformation and, hence, its bioactivity. In addition, the involvement of the aspartic acid residue in overall peptide structural stabilization also illustrates a previously undetermined role for this region (i.e. CDPG) of the oligopeptide. A subsequent in vitro experiment demonstrated a significant loss of bioactivity upon mutating the terminal residue from arginine to lysine, thereby corroborating the overall findings of the computational model, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we contrast the structural consequences of domain swapping from two designed three-helix bundles: one with an up-down-up topology, and the other with an up-down-down topology. The up-down-up topology gives rise to a domain-swapped dimer whose structure has been determined to 1.5 Angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallography. In contrast, the domain-swapped protein with an up-down-down topology forms fibrils as shown by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. This demonstrates that design principles can predict the oligomeric state of 3D domain-swapped molecules, which should aid in the design of domain-swapped proteins and biomaterials.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, DOE Lab Struct Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Johnson Res Fdn, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Eisenberg, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, DOE Lab Struct Biol, POB 951570, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",david@mbi.ucla.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM054616, R37 GM054616, GM-54616]",,,40,137,137,2,22,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Macrophages phagocytose orthopaedic debris and release proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases and other substances. In addition, other cell types present in tissues harvested from the bone-implant interface are thought to influence periprosthetic bone resorption. The present study examined the effects of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), cobalt chrome molybdenum alloy (CoCr), and titanium-alloy particle challenge on macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes in vitro. Potential synergistic effects of lymphocytes on macrophage activation were determined by measuring interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a release following exposure to orthopaedic biomaterial particles. Exposure of macrophages or macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes to all three types of particles resulted in increased release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a! at 48 h, when compared to macrophages or macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes, respectively, cultured in the absence of particles. Lymphocytes isolated from periprosthetic tissues secreted increased basal levels of cytokines relative to peripheral blood lymphocytes. Higher doses of PMMA and titanium-alloy particles stimulated increased levels of cytokine release in the macrophage and macrophage/lymphocyte groups. In contrast, a higher dose of CoCr particles (0.075% v/v) was not as effective as the 0.015% v/v dose, indicating probable CoCr toxicity. The macrophage/lymphocyte co-culture did not show synergism between the two types of cells with respect to cytokine release. T-cells at the bone-implant interface may alter the biological response to particulate debris. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We examined in vivo in a chronic sheep model the performance of a Biocor bovine internal mammary artery (BIMA) graft after No-React processing. Methods:'No-React' processing consists of aldehyde cross-linkage following a detoxification process with multiple physical variables and incubation with surfactant. Biocor BIMA No-React treated grafts have been interposed in the carotid artery in seven sheep with a Dacron graft as control. Grafts were explanted after 3 or 6 months and were grossly examined, by X-ray, histology, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: In the BIMA, good healing was found with a smooth intimal surface, minimal inflammatory reaction, and a well preserved ultrastructure. Calcification increased progressively. In the Dacron grafts, a fibrous covering the inner surface and infiltration with fibroblasts, histiocytes and macrophages was noted. Calcium content was stable, Conclusion: Calcification increased progressively in Biocor BIMA No-React grafts. Minimal inflammatory changes, a smooth inner surface and well preserved ultrastructure were noted. (C) 2001 The International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two cases were considered, namely the shape of the particle was held constant while the volume fraction of HAp was varied and the particle shape was changed whilst the volume fraction was constant. For block shaped embedded particles, it was found that the SCF decreases with an increase of the HAp particle volume fraction. It was also found that the shape of reinforcing particles had little effect on the mechanical behaviour of material. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three batches of HA ceramic with different porosities were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Pore size and shape as well as density were determined. In vitro experiments were performed in order to evaluate the dissolution behavior of cisplatin in the system. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the final product consisted of a single phase, indicating that the sintering process had not affected the structure of the HA. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) showed absence of impurities. Pore diameters were in the range 15-34 mum. SEM showed that the material presented a highly interconnected spheroidal porous network with open micropores and closed macropores.

The implants were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde one group (CG-G/PP) or left untreated (CG-nG/PP) and compared to PP mesh. At 4 weeks, the abdominal wall was assessed for the degree of adhesions. The composite implants developed a nascent connective tissue-like structure that reduced adhesions to the bowel, The thickest connective tissue developed in the CG-G/PP group (0.7 +/- 0.1 mm) and thinnest in the PP mesh (0.05 +/- 0.01 mm). The surface area covered with adhesions was greatest in the PP group (72 +/- 17%) compared with the CG-G/PP group (28 +/- 15%) or the CG-nG/PP group (21 +/- 8%). Bowel preferentially adhered to the PP mesh, whereas omentum had some adherence to all constructs. Integrating a biodegradable extracellular matrix analog with a permanent structural biomaterial reduced adhesions in this animal model. Alterations in cross-linking of the CG matrix altered the biological response, This technology may be useful in reconstructive surgery by reducing adhesion formation, while maintaining the strength of permanent structural biomaterials.

The treatment with a H2O2/HCl solution at 80 degreesC for 30 min followed by heating at 400 degreesC for 1 h produces an anatase titania gel layer on the specimen surface. This gel layer deposits apatite both on the contact and on open surfaces, and apatite deposition ability does not change with pre-staking in distilled water. The treatment with a NaOH solution at 60 degreesC for 3 days produces a sodium titanate gel layer. This gel layer can deposit apatite only on the contact surface, and the apatite deposition ability is completely lost after 1 day of pre-staking in distilled water. It is concluded, therefore, that the bioactivity of the titania gel originates from the favorable structure of the gel itself while the bioactivity of the sodium titanate gel depends heavily on ion release from the gel. The third treatment, a simple heat treatment at 400 degreesC for 1 h, produces a dense (not porous) oxide layer on the specimen surface. The specimens can deposit apatite on the contact surface after only 3 days of staking in SBF, but they cannot deposit apatite on the open surface for up to 2 months of staking. The implications of such apatite deposition behavior have been discussed in relation to the environments of titanium implants in bone as well as to the methodology of the SBF staking experiment.

The contrast in the damage to poly(urethane)s (PUs) was monitored by measuring radiolabel release elicited from a C-14-polyester-urea-urethane (PEUU) during incubation with both cell types. Human PMN were seeded onto polymer-coated glass slips and both radiolabel release as well as serine protease activity [assayed with N-benzyloxycarbonyl lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT)] were measured 18 h later. Human monocytes were cultured on polystyrene tissue culture plates for 14 days, trypsinized, and seeded onto the polymer-coated glass sips; then, radiolabel release and esterase activity [assayed with p-nitrophenylbutyrate (PNB)] were measured after 18 h. Coverslips with MDM were also incubated for an additional 2 weeks. At 18 h postincubation with the PEUU, MDM elicited 25 times more radiolabel release per 10(6) cells than PMN at 18 h and continued to increase more than sevenfold over the 18-h value during the subsequent 14-day period. The BLT activity in PMN did not increase significantly during the 18-h incubation period, whereas the PNB activity in MDM increased more than fourfold. The MDM, but not the PMN elicited radiolabel release, was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, as was the increase in PNB activity. The data provide evidence for a hydrolytic role for MDM and, to a lesser extent PMN, in the biodegradation of implanted materials. The full implication of the release of polymer-derived chemical agents from this hydrolytic cleavage of the implanted biomaterials, on the propagation of the inflammatory response, remains to be elucidated.

In these applications titanium is considered the ""gold standard."" However, tissue reactions around titanium implants and the changing trend to leave orthopedic devices in the body have led to a new examination of the preferred material. This in vitro study tested the behavior of osteoblasts on cpTi, Ti-6Al-7Nb, and stainless steel with surface designs similar to clinical implants. After surface characterization by scanning electron microscopy and profilometry, cell proliferation and the differentiation parameters of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin were measured. For all materials tested, the growth curves showed a similar kinetic. On Ti-6Al-7Nb, ALP activity was significantly lower when compared with steel, and cpTi and did not change over the time. ALP activity increased moderately on steel and cpTi. Osteocalcin levels were higher on both titanium materials than on steel. Based on undisturbed cell growth and the relatively high alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels, we suggest that cpTi provides the best biocompatibility with regard to proliferation, in addition to more reliable early and late differentiation markers of human osteoblasts in vitro.

The graft carries a coating of immobilized dipyridamole (Persantin(R)) on the surface of its lumen. Dipyridamole is a potent nontoxic inhibitor of platelet activation/aggregation, and also a strong inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. The polyurethane material is also known as Chronoflex(R), and already finds use as a vascular access graft. The coated vascular graft was studied in vitro (hemocompatibility, interaction with blood platelets and cultured endothelial cells), as well as in two established in vivo models. In the first in vivo study, coated grafts were implanted in goats, as a bypass of the carotid artery (four animals, eight grafts, length of the graft was approximately 12 cm). Four uncoated grafts were used as controls in otherwise identical experiments. in the second in vivo experiment, eight sheep were used. Each animal received one coated and one uncoated prosthesis as an interposition graft in the carotid artery (length of the graft was 4 cm). The in vitro experiments revealed that the dipyridamole coating has three beneficial effects: reduced thrombogenicity, reduced adherence of blood platelets, and accommodation of a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells. The goat experiments showed patency of the coated grafts in three of the eight cases. The sheep experiments were not useful for the evaluation of the dipyridamole coating because deterioration of the polyurethane material was observed. The in vivo results indicate that the dipyridamole coating may positively influence the patency rate, probably because the coating promotes the growth of an endothelial cell lining. The sheep data show, however, that the limited stability of the Chronoflex(R) material precludes its issue for the construction of permanent small-bore vascular grafts.

Properties of the solid composites obtained were studied with FTIR, X-ray diffraction, and SEM techniques.

The peptides were selected based on their presumed preferential interactions with the cell-surface integrins on vascular endothelial cells. The ability of the surfaces to support the preferential adhesion of human vascular endothelial cells was studied by comparing in vitro adhesion results for these cells with those from mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Surface modification with the peptides was confirmed by water-contact angles and XPS. Surface morphology was determined by AFM and SEM. In vitro cell-culture studies in conjunction with plasma-protein adsorption and immunoblotting were performed on the various modified surfaces. The data suggest that peptide-modified surfaces have significant potential for supporting cell adhesion. Little or no cell adhesion was noted on gold- or cysteine-modified control surfaces. Human vascular endothelial cells showed the greatest adhesion to the CCRRG-DWLC-modified surfaces, and the 3T3 fibroblasts adhered best to the CREDV-modified surfaces. Protein adsorption studies suggest that the preferential adsorption of the cell-adhesive proteins fibronectin and vitronectin is not likely mediating the differences noted. It is concluded that the cell-adhesive peptide-modified gold-coated polymers have significant potential for further development both as model substrates for fundamental studies and for use in biomaterials applications.

We investigated whether tTgase enhances the biological recognition of poly (DL lactide co-glycolide) (PLG), poly (epsilon -caprolactone) (PCL), and poly (L lactide) (PLA), biomaterials widely used in medical implants. Three cell-model systems consisting of human osteoblasts, endothelial cells (ECV-304), and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were utilized, in which tTgase expression was modulated by gene transfer, and the ability of cells to spread on these polymers was quantified in relation to the altered level of expressed tTGase. Results show that over-expression of tTgase in human osteoblasts positively correlated with cell spreading on PLG, while no attachment and spreading was found on PCL and PLA. Antisense silencing of tTgase in the endothelial cells led to a marked reduction of cell spreading on all polymers. The hydrophobic nature of PLC also appeared to favor endothelial cell attachment. Spreading of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts on these biomaterials was only slightly affected by increased expression of tTgase, although cell spreading on control glass was increased. We propose that the consideration of tTgase-mediated bioactivity in novel biomaterials may improve cell attachment and promote biocompatibility.

The polymerizations were carried out in solution, in the case of acrylic acid a vapor phase graft-co-polymerization subsequent to argon plasma activation was carried out as well. Human fibronectin (hFn), which acts as a cell adhesion mediator for fibroblasts, was immobilized by making use of the generated carboxylic or epoxy groups, respectively. Surface analysis was accomplished by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode (IR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic contact angle measurements using the Wilhelmy-plate method. The amount of immobilized active hFn was semiquantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a structure-specific antibody against the cell-binding domain of hFn. In vitro testing showed a remarkable difference between surfaces exposing adsorbed-only and surfaces with covalently immobilized hFn.

CL revealed internal structures within plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite coatings which were not discernible by SEM-BSE imaging. However, cathodoluminescence microscopy alone can presently not be used in every case to characterize synthetic calcium phosphate biomaterials because of the dominant intrinsic blue CL emission. In the future, optimum results will likely be achieved by using a combination of CL microscopy and spectroscopy with other spatially resolved analytical methods such as SEM-BSE, SEM-CL or micro-Raman spectroscopy. In the present study, different types of tetracalcium phosphate dental cements could be distinguished due to varying CL colours and CL spectra that are caused by a different content of impurity Mn.

Calcium-phosphate ceramics are synthetic bone substitutes which promote new bone formation by osteoconduction. These ceramics possess osteoconductive properties but have no intrinsic osteoinductive capacity. They are unable to induce new bone formation in extraossesous sites. One solution to develop bone substitutes with osteogenic properties would be to associate biomaterials with osteoprogenitors. Materials and methods We studied the in vitro osteogenic potential of human bone-marrow cells cultured on macroporous calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic, examining stromal cell proliferation and differentiation. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated in terms of alkaline phosphatase activity and immunological characterization of the extracellular fibrillar matrix formed by these cells. The specimens were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results Human bone-marrow cells proliferated on CaP ceramic. The proliferating bone-marrow cells expressed an osteoblastic phenotype as shown by alkaline phosphatase activity and synthesis in ceramic pores of an extracellular matrix composed of fibronectin, osteocalcin and collagen 1. In addition, numerous microcrystals of apatite precipitated on the fibrillar matrix, producing a mineralized fibrillar network within the ceramic. Conclusion This study demonstrates that human bone-marrow cells cultured on macroporous CaP ceramic do not lose their osteoblastic phenotype even after 21 days of culture, and that they can induce osteogenesis in a CaP ceramic in vitro. This type of new ""hybrid material"" appears promising for the future.","Fac Med, Lab Physiopathol Resorpt Osseuse, F-44035 Nantes 1, France","Heymann, D (reprint author), Fac Med, Lab Physiopathol Resorpt Osseuse, 1 Rue Gaston Veil, F-44035 Nantes 1, France.",,,,,,,40,10,10,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

This review elucidates recent advances in the understanding of heteroepitaxy exemplifying the growth of copper on Ni(100) and the growth of para-hexaphenyl on GaAs. Although copper on nickel belongs to the simplest systems, unprecedented morphologies arise, such as ramified islands on a square lattice and strain relief by internal faceting. The elongated para-hexaphenyl crystallites formed on GaAs(001) exhibit a polarized blue light emission, which is a basis for developing organic diode lasers. Anisotropic thin film morphologies are also realized by oblique incidence deposition of noncentrosymmetric organic molecules onto amorphous substrates. Using the frequency doubling of light, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the films not only are anisotropic but also exhibit a preferential orientation of the molecules. Germanium nanopyramids epitaxially grown on Si(001) provide evidence that a well-defined nanopatterned substrate alters the contact angles of water, the protein adsorption and activity, as well as the cell behavior. These results are a milestone in structural biocompatibility on the nanometer scale.","ETH Zurich, Dept Werkstoffe, CH-8952 Schlieren, Switzerland","Muller, B (reprint author), ETH Zurich, Dept Werkstoffe, Wagistr 23, CH-8952 Schlieren, Switzerland.",,"Wu, Qihong/B-9803-2009; Muller, Bert/A-6838-2008; Schaff, William/B-5839-2009","Muller, Bert/0000-0003-4078-9109; ",,,,257,29,29,1,24,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"JOURNAL DEPT PO BOX 128 FARRER ROAD, SINGAPORE 912805, SINGAPORE",0218-625X,,,SURF REV LETT,Surf.

The prosthesis-peritoneum interface is the site of several possible problems, including the formation of adhesions and erosion of the intestinal loops, which mag lead to the formation of fistulas. This investigation was designed to compare the behavior of two prosthetic biomaterials in composite form at the level of the peritoneum. Defects (7 x 5 cm) were created in the abdominal wall of 18 white New Zealand rabbits weighing approximately 2500 g. The defects (involving aponeurotic and muscular planes and the parietal peritoneum) were repaired with polypropylene (PL) + ePTFE (Preclude dura substitute) or Parietex composite (PC) prostheses. The prostheses were secured to the edges of the defect by continuous PL sutures interrupted at the corners of the implant. Three study groups were established according to the type of implant: group I(n = 6) (controls)-PL; group II (n = 6)-PL + ePTFE; and group III (n = 6)-PC. The animals mere sacrificed 14 days after implant, and the prostheses were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The formation of adhesions at the prosthesis-visceral peritoneum interface were quantified according to a protocol previously described by us. The biomechanical resistance of the implant was evaluated using strips comprising prosthetic material and anchorage tissue. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare data corresponding to each group. There was no postimplant mortality. No infection or rejection of the prosthesis was observed in any of the animals. Firm adhesions were detected in the PL implants, whereas in the PL + ePTFE and PC implants the adhesions were loose. The mean prosthetic surface areas covered by adhesions mere 7.67, 0.10 and 0.19 cm(2) for groups I, II, and iii, respectively, shelving a significant difference between values corresponding to groups I and II and to groups I and III (p < 0.05). Comparison of values recorded for groups II and III yielded no significant difference (p >0.05). In groups II and III, the neoperitoneum was homogeneous and composed of organized and vascularized connective tissue covered by a mesoendothelium that was interrupted by accumulations of fibroblasts and white blood cells. In contrast, a disorganized neoperitoneum of rough texture was observed in the group I specimens. At times, areas of hemorrhage and necrosis corresponding to the sites of adhesion formation could be observed. Resistance to traction of composite implants (mean +/- SD: 15.72 +/- 1.32 and 15.89 +/- 2.73) was similar to that of the PL implants (15.03 +/- 2.92) (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0.05). It may be concluded that (1) composite prostheses show optimum behavior in terms of adhesion formation at the prosthesis-visceral peritoneum interface; (2) the neoperitoneum formed after the implant of a composite prosthesis almost physically and functionally replaces the normal peritoneum; (3) a significantly greater degree of peritoneal regeneration is achieved after implant of a PC prosthesis; and (4) there was no significant difference regarding biomechanical resistance between PL prostheses and PL + ePTFE and Parietex composites.","Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Madrid 28871, Spain","Bellon, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Crta Madrid Barcelona,Km 33-6, Madrid 28871, Spain.",,,"Garcia Honduvilla, Natalio/0000-0003-0904-6198; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,15,39,40,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0364-2313,,,WORLD J SURG,World J.Surg.,FEB,2001.0,25,2,,,,,147,152,,10.1007/s002680020069,,,,6,Surgery,Surgery,422QV,WOS:000168131500007,11338014.0,,,,2019-02-25

In odontology, using dental preparations containing fluorides could alter the behaviour of titanium. After a review of the experimental works dealing with the effects of fluoride ions at different pH on titanium salts in solution, it was proceeded to a thermodynamic investigation at 25 degreesC in the range of concentrations and pH corresponding to the solutions commonly used. Such a study gives a possibility to specify which species could be involved in the corrosion reaction to calculate the corresponding potentials, and lastly to define the domain of insolubility of TiO2. From these results, the reaction of titanium in laboratory spontaneous corrosion and voltammetric experiments was interpreted. From the recent experiments described and discussed in this article, it becomes evident that the close connection with the results obtained in this study contributes to support our thermodynamic model.

The P(CL-b-GA) and P(LA-b-GA) diblock copolymers that formed were fractionated by the use of a selective solvent for each block and were characterized by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The livingness of the operative coordination-insertion mechanism is responsible for the control of the copolyester composition, the length of the blocks, and, ultimately, the thermal behavior. Because of the inherent insolubility of the polyglycolide blocks, microphase separation occurs during the course of the sequential polymerization, resulting in a stable, colloidal, nonaqueous copolymer dispersion, as confirmed by photon correlation spectroscopy.

Attachment density was found to vary sharply around a critical dose, making the technique useful for patterns such as gradients which require varying density. An optimal dose of 200 muC/cm(2) was found for attaching fluorescent polystyrene spheres to MHDA-cysteamine templates. A cycling process was developed for aligning patterns of two or more kinds of polystyrene spheres.

Amongst these biomaterials, hydroxyapatites (HA) offer good properties of biocompatibility and bioactivity when they interact with bone. This interaction depends mainly on the physico-chemical properties of HA particles. In this work, using a scanning transmission electronic microscope equipped with an Si(Li) detector for x-ray analysis, we analysed three kinds of hydroxyapatite: non-sintered particles, 600 degreesC sintered particles and 1180 degreesC sintered particles. Then, we determined the Ca/P concentration ratio in order to observe the influence of the temperature processing on this ratio. Concurrently, we carried out measurements on the HA powders by varying the electron irradiation dose either with the current density or with irradiation time. When the electron irradiation dose varied with the current density (at constant and short irradiation time), the Ca/P concentration ratio did not vary. But, at fixed current density and increasing irradiation time, the calcium and phosphorus intensities decreased, leading to an increase of the Ca/P concentration ratio at high electron irradiation dose. This phenomenon represents a mass loss of the specimen during electronic bombardment. We propose an experimental procedure to avoid all these problems.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 02, France","Benhayoune, H (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader, F-51685 Reims 02, France.",,"Laquerriere, Patrice/P-1025-2016","Laquerriere, Patrice/0000-0001-7637-9094",,,,15,20,20,1,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0022-3727,,,J PHYS D APPL PHYS,J.

Therefore, the main objective is to obtain, a bioceramic coating with the inherent profits derived from the laser surfacing technique. In this work, we have studied the influence of the relevant parameters of the laser processing on the composition and morphology of the coatings obtained. The characterization of the coated samples has been carried out by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX).

Human fibroblast, mixed with 1% to 100% of porcine fibroblast, could be significantly distinguished in the isoenzyme assay. Based on the glucose-6-phosphophate-dehydrogenase analysis, the human fibroblast tested in this study belonged to the B type human cells. Lactate dehydrogenase (LD), malate dehydrogenase (MD) and mannose phosphate isomerase isoenzyme (MPI) activities obviously revealed that a different pattern corresponds to the percentage of human and porcine cell mixtures. The discriminatory limit of MPI, LD and MD activity can reach up to 1% of sensitivity of the isoenzyme analysis.

The beam's interaction with biomaterials gives rise to concerns related to thermal damage and radiation damage. Of the two issues, the thermal interaction is conducive to rigorous analysis from first principles, although this has not been performed to date in a comprehensive manner. In this study, the interaction of the X-ray beam emanating from a third-generation synchrotron with a typical frozen biocrystal is theoretically studied, focusing specifically on the resulting unsteady (time-dependent) and steady heat-transfer phenomena. A unique regime map is developed to explain and to identify, on the basis of Fourier and Biot numbers as governing parameters, the applicable mathematical models that predict the subsequent thermal behavior. Depending on the values of these parameters, some simplified but realistic 'generic' solutions are generated that are suitable for that particular domain of applicability. Classical heat-transfer theory was used to describe the third-generation X-ray beam and biomaterial thermal interaction. Besides the generalized approach presented, numerous illustrative cases were solved and the resulting temperature levels are explicitly presented. Overall, the resulting thermal behavior of the system, i.e. peak and local temperature distribution, during both early transient development and for sustained long-time steady-state conditions, depends on a number of factors including the amount of energy absorbed, convective heat-transfer film coefficient and gas temperature, the sample size and shape, and the thermophysical properties of the sample and cooling gas. Results of the analysis revealed the strong influence that convection has on the transient and final steady-state temperature of the sample and the impact of internal heat conduction. The characteristic timescales of the important and dominant thermal processes with respect to the two types of thermal models are clearly identified.","Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Kazmierczak, M (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",,,,,,,16,40,40,2,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0907-4449,,,ACTA CRYSTALLOGR D,Acta Crystallogr.

They have also a relatively low young's modulus, allowing a good load transfer to the bone. The elastic modulus difference between metallic implant material and bone is large, which can lead to a fracture of the implant. To solve this problem, many implants for artificial joint and dental applications have been produced by powder metallurgy routes, obtaining a porous material with an even lower young's modulus than that of the bulk titanium. This porous structure allows bone ingrowth, as the osseous tissue invade the holes of the porous material while growing and adheres to it. Besides, near net shape technologies like powder metallurgy and injection molding techniques, can reduce the components high costs due to machining final steps, also providing a fine, uniform grain structure and lack of texture and segregation. This work outlines the characteristics, properties and some of the powder routes for producing titanium surgical implants and implant porous coatings.","Inst Nacl Tecnol, DMCM, BR-20081310 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; UFRJ, COPPE, Programa Engn Mat & Met, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; UFRGS, DMCM, INT, LdTM,Ctr Tecnol, BR-20081310 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","de Oliveira, MV (reprint author), Inst Nacl Tecnol, DMCM, Av Venezuela 82-603, BR-20081310 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",1013-9826,,0-87849-864-8,KEY ENG MAT,,,2001.0,189-1,,,,,,437,442,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.189-191.437,,,,6,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BS01C,WOS:000168303300069,,,,,2019-02-25

In this work a femur FEM model has been developed to represent structural behavior correctly, by modeling cancellous bone arrangement in proximal end and defining for it transversally isotropic material properties. A comparison between a FEM analysis on this model and on a model that considers the proximal end as an isotropic material shows that the orthotropic model simulates a more realistic stress distribution in the bone because permits to simulate tile structural role played by the trabecular systems, detecting clearly in the Ward Triangle a bone fracture region and giving in this way a method to approach the femur - neck fracture and the femur - prosthesis interface in a prosthesized bone.","Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Mat & Prod Engn, Naples, Italy","Bellucci, M (reprint author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Mat & Prod Engn, Naples, Italy.",,,"apicella, antonio/0000-0002-5365-6033",,,,10,0,0,0,3,SOC ADVANCEMENT MATERIAL & PROCESS ENGINEERING,COVINA,"1161 PARKVIEW DR,, COVINA, CA 91724-3748 USA",0892-2624,,0-938994-91-3,INT SAMPE TECH CONF,,,2001.0,33,,,,,,648,662,,,,,,15,"Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science,BT76Y,WOS:000173976200058,,,,,2019-02-25

Several emerging strategies in biomaterials research take advantage of phospholipids to compartmentalize and/or template chemical reactions via self-assembled structures such as liposomes and tubules. Still others exploit the inherent biocompatibility of phospholipids and phospholipid-mimetic materials for use as novel tissue-contacting biomaterials that mimic biological membranes. In the future, phospholipid-based materials may be increasingly utilized as tools for the manipulation of cell and tissue responses to biomaterials, for controlled drug release, for reconstructive surgery, and as tissue-engineered constructs.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Collier, JH (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-collier@northwestern.edu; philm@northwestern.edu,"Messersmith, Phil/B-6695-2009; Sanguansri, Luz/B-6630-2011; Messersmith, Phillip/F-3433-2013","Sanguansri, Luz/0000-0003-1908-7604; Messersmith, Phillip/0000-0002-1197-333X",,,,116,100,104,1,76,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1531-7331,,,ANNU REV MATER RES,Ann.

Glassy polymeric carbon (GPC), made from cured phenolic resins, has a high chemical inertness that makes it useful as a biomaterial in medicine for drug delivery systems and for the manufacture of heart valves and other prosthetic devices. Low and high-energy ion beams have been used, with both partially and fully cured phenolic resins, to enhance biological cell/tissue growth on, and to increase tissue adhesion to GPC surfaces. Samples bombarded with energetic ion beams in the keV to MeV range exhibited increased surface roughness, measured using optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Ion beams were also used to perform nuclear reaction analyses of GPC encapsulated drugs for use in internal drug delivery systems. The results from the high energy bombardment were more dramatic and are shown in this paper. The interaction of energetic ions has demonstrated the useful application of ion beams to enhance the properties of carbon-based biomaterials.","Alabama A&M Univ, Ctr Irradiat Mat, Normal, AL 35762 USA","Evelyn, AL (reprint author), Alabama A&M Univ, Ctr Irradiat Mat, Normal, AL 35762 USA.",,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,0-7354-0015-6,AIP CONF PROC,,,2001.0,576,,,,,,1024,1027,,,,,,4,"Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Physics, Atomic, Molecular & Chemical; Physics, Nuclear; Spectroscopy",Materials Science; Physics; Spectroscopy,BT20F,WOS:000172263600245,,,,,2019-02-25

At 7 days, cell count highlighted a significant slowing down of the proliferation of osteopenic bone-derived osteoblasts.

The aim of the present study was to characterise an in vitro model of cultured rat femora and test the possibility of using this model in dynamic studies on bone healing. 24 femurs were explanted after 12 rats were killed for other experimental protocols. A standard bone defect was created in the distal femoral condyles and femurs were cultured in GBJb medium. Arginine and lysine were administered daily in the Arg-Lys group. The other femurs were left untreated (Control group). At 1, 7, 14 and 21 days, alkaline phosphatase activity, nitric oxide and calcium were measured on the supernatant. At 21 days, femurs were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate for histomorphometry and microhardness evaluation of the newly formed bone. The current results showed that it was possible to study bone healing in vitro by using cultured bones from adult animals. A process for bone healing was observed also in untreated bones. Moreover, the structural analysis of the cultured bone showed that it had characteristics similar to those of the femurs, when they were embedded in resin immediately after animal sacrifice. The effect of Arg and Lys confirmed data of a previous study, where a faster healing of bone defect and fracture was observed in rabbits after Arg and Lys administration.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Res Inst Cofivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Fac Med, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Torricelli, P (reprint author), Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Res Inst Cofivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/J-5298-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/0000-0001-7494-9970; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,13,6,6,0,3,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",1073-1199,,,ARTIF CELL BLOOD SUB,Artif.

In this work, we studied poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) membranes, a resorbable biomaterial, which were either dense or had different pore diameters (less than 45 mum, between 180 and 250 mum, and between 250 and 350 mum), in relation to stimulation of cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation in vitro. We used Vero cells, a fibroblastic cell line, as the biological model of investigation. We found that cells attached slowly to all PLLA membranes studied. On the Ether hand, once the adhesion occurs, the cells are able to grow and differentiate on the different polymers. The cells grew to form a confluent monolayer and were capable of producing collagen Type IV and fibronectin on different PLLA membranes. This behavior indicates that cells try to create a better environment to stimulate their growth. This also indicates that Vero cells alter their differentiation pattern once they are producing extracellular matrix molecules related to epithelial differentiation.","State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Cell Biol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mat Engn, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Fac Odontol Piracicaba, Dept Social Odontol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Santos, AR (reprint author), State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Cell Biol, CP 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",,"Santos, Jr, Arnaldo/I-4813-2012; Dolder, Mary Anne Heidi/J-8618-2012; Duek, Eliana/J-2499-2012","Santos, Jr, Arnaldo/0000-0003-0535-0088; ",,,,36,30,32,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

The Transwell insert methodology was developed to assess the biocompatibility of solid materials used in dentistry and, when initially designed, used the release of radiochromium (Cr-51) in the cytotoxicity assay. Another aim of this study was to evaluate different exposure regimes with which to assess cytotoxicity. The exposure regimes included: a 1-hour exposure in buffer followed by a 24-hour incubation in growth medium; a a-hour exposure in buffer followed by a 24-hour incubation in growth medium; a 24-hour exposure in serum-limited medium; and a 24-hour exposure in a serum-sufficient medium. The bioindicator target was the Smulow-Glickman (S-G) human gingival cell line and the biomaterials were dental restoratives. The Transwell insert methodology with the NRU cytotoxicity assay as the cytotoxicity endpoint was effective in differentiating the potencies of the dental restoratives; a a-hour exposure in buffer and a 24-hour exposure in serum-limited medium were the exposure regimes that most clearly differentiated the test agents according to their potencies.

The dynamic surface pressure, re-spreading ratio, compressibility, hysteresis area and recruitment index of pure films of the main phospholipids of pulmonary surfactant namely dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol ne, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and of binary mixed films of these phospholipids in the ratio of 2:3 were studied both in the presence and absence of calcium by in vitro analysis using a Wilhelmy balance. Surface excess films, of each of the surfactant systems, with initial concentration 15 Angstrom (2) molecule were compressed at the rate of 50 seconds/cycle past collapse till a compression ratio of 4:1. The presence of 5 mM calcium caused a significant decrease in compressibility (p < 0.05 Mann-Whitney U test) of all the surfactant monolayer films. No further benefit was obtained by adding 20 mM calcium over that of 5 mM calcium. A significant beneficial effect of calcium (p < 0.05 Mann-Whitney U test) on film stability was observed when analysing the materials in a pulsating bubble surfactometer, in which liposomal suspensions of 1% concentration in the presence of 5 mM calcium were pulsated at a high frequency of 40 cycles per minute, corresponding to the respiratory frequency of neonates. The ultrastructure of the liposomal suspensions were also studied using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy and longitudinal micro-tubular structures were found on addition of 5 mM calcium, which could have resulted in the improved performance of the exogenous surfactants with respect to compressibility and stability.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Cardiovasc Res, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Thin Films Lab, Bombay, Maharashtra, India","Banerjee, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Cardiovasc Res, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.",,,,,,,27,3,3,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The purification procedure of the polymers did not negatively influence the final microcapsule properties. The mechanical stability of microcapsules from purified material is even slightly higher than that of microcapsules from the original polymers. A second approach to avoid endotoxin release from the device is its direct complexation during the bead or capsule formation process. The durability of endotoxin binding in binary, ternary, and quaternary complexes could be demonstrated for storage in culture medium and saline. Very low total endotoxin release from the complexes was detected after three months in culture medium and five months in saline.

The impact of chemical modifications of polysulphone (PSU) capillary polymers with a cutoff of 50 kD on glucose-induced insulin secretion of macroencapsulated rat islets was studied in perifusion experiments. The insulin release of free-floating islets showed the typical rapid response to glucose stimulation. Total insulin release (AUC between minute 30 and 120 of perifusion) reached 117+/-22 ng/ml. Blending PSU with polyvinyl pyrrolidone or sodium-dodecyl-sulfate was not suitable for islet macroencapsulation, since glucose-induced insulin release was absent or disturbed. Hydroxy-methylation (CH2OH) of PSU improved the secretory behavior of macroencapsulated islets depending on the degree of PSU substitution (DS 0.8, AUC 62+/-15 ng/ml; DS 1.8, 111+/-24 ng/ml). In highly substituted PSU-capillaries the kinetics of glucose-induced insulin release was very similar to that observed in free-floating islets. Two consecutive glucose stimulations potentiated insulin release of free-floating islets during the second period of stimulation. Furthermore, freshly isolated macroencapsulated islets responded with more efficient insulin secretion after the initial priming. In conclusion, in vitro membrane screening identified highly substituted hydroxy-methylated PSU as the material of choice for islet encapsulation in a bioartificial pancreas.","Univ Tubingen, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Univ Tubingen, Inst Gen Surg, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Inst Text & Proc Engn, D-73770 Denkendorf, Germany","Lembert, N (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Morgenstelle 8, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,8,10,11,0,3,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-342-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2001.0,944,,,,,,271,276,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Transplantation",Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Transplantation,BT69D,WOS:000173774500022,11797676.0,,,,2019-02-25

Safety, consistency. and functionality of biomaterials used as matrices, scaffolds, and immobilizing agents in TEMPS are a concern. Therefore, the ASTM has established a number of task groups to produce standards and guidelines for such biomaterials. Alginate is a naturally occurring biomaterial used for immobilizing living cells to form an artificial organ, such as encapsulated pancreatic islets. In order to aid in successful clinical applications and to help expedite regulatory approval, the alginate used must be fully documented. The ASTM alginate guide gives information on selection of testing methodologies and safety criteria. Critical parameters such as monomer content, molecular weight, and viscosity, in addition to more general parameters, such as dry matter content, heavy metal content. bioburden, and endotoxin content are described in the ASTM document. In a like manner, the characterization parameters for chitosan, a bioadhesive polycationic polysaccharide, are described in a separate guide. For chitosan, the degree of deacetylation is of critical importance. Control of protein content and, hence, potential for hypersensitivity, endotoxin content, and total bioburden are important in chitosan preparations for TEMPS. Together these two guides represent part of the effort on behalf of the ASTM and other interested parties to ensure quality and standardization in TEMPS.","Pronova Biomed AS, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; US FDA, Ctr Devices & Radiol Hlth, Div Mech & Mat Sci, Rockville, MD 20857 USA","Dornish, M (reprint author), Pronova Biomed AS, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",mdornish@pronova.no,,,,,,43,75,81,3,21,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-343-2; 1-57331-342-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2001.0,944,,,,,,388,397,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Transplantation",Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Transplantation,BT69D,WOS:000173774500033,11797688.0,,,,2019-02-25

Future directions in this area will lead to an abandonment of the trial-and-error implant optimization approach and a switch to the rational production of precisely formulated nanobiological devices. This will he accomplished with the help of three major thrusts: (1) use of molecularly manipulated nanostructured biomimetic materials; (2) application of microelectronic and nanoelectronic interfacing for sensing and control, and (3) application of drug delivery and medical nanosystems to induce, maintain, and replace a missing function that cannot be readily substituted with a living cell and to accelerate tissue regeneration. Biomimetics, involves employment of microstructures and functional domains of organismal tissue function, correlation of processes and structures with physical and chemical processes, and use of this knowledge base to design and synthesize new materials for health applications. Nanostructured materials should involve biological materials (rather then synthetic ones) because their prefabricated structure is suitable for modular control of devices from existing materials. Nanostructured tools should encompass surface patterned molecular arrays, nanoscale synthetic scaffolding mimicking the cell-extracellular matrix microenvironment, precise positioning of molecules with specific signals to provide microheterogeneity, composites of bioinorganic and organic molecules, molecular layering (coating), and molecular and supramolecular self-assembly and self-organization (template-directed) assembly.

Control and DPPA sponges were initially seeded with 10(6) or 10(7) foetal bovine epiphyseal chondrocytes and maintained for 4 weeks in culture under static conditions in RPMI/NCTC medium with 10% FCS and without addition of fresh ascorbic acid. Both supports were always present during the study and a partial decrease in size and weight was detected only with control sponges, both seeded and unseeded. Cell proliferation was only noted in the 10(6) cells-seeded sponges (4-fold increase after 4 weeks of culture). Specific cartilage collagens (types II and XI) were deposited in the matrix throughout the culture and traces of type I collagen were noticed only in the culture medium after 2-3 weeks and 4 weeks in the case of 10(6) and 10(7) cells-seeded sponges, respectively. Glycosaminoglycans accumulated in the matrix, up to 1.8 and 9.8% of total dry weight after one month with both seeding conditions, which was much lower than in the natural tissue. In the 10(7) cells-seeded sponges, mineral deposition, observed with unseeded sponges, was significantly decreased (2- to 3-fold).

After PLA dissolved with methylene chloride was mixed with the fibers, the mixture was dried completely and subsequently hot-pressed uniaxially under a pressure of 40 MPa at 180 degreesC, resulting in the fabrication of the PLA/HAF composite. The modulus of elasticity was improved effectively even by introducing a small amount of HAF; almost no degradation in the bending strength was observed and the modulus of elasticity showed high values of 5-10 GPa when the fibers of 20-60 wt% were introduced. With increasing HAF content, the maximum strain decreases and the specimen is apt to show a brittle fracture, this result implies that HAF in the composites can share the applied load efficiently due to the formation of a bond between HAF and PLA.

These materials were made by copolymerisation of the constituent monomers via a free radical method, and characterised using NMR, FT-IR, viscometry and elemental analysis. The optimum crosslink density and conditions required for curing coatings of these polymers were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and showed the inclusion of 5 mol% silyl crosslinking agent to be ideal. A nanoindentation technique was employed to determine if the coating developed elasticity upon crosslinking. The biological properties of the coatings were evaluated using a variety of protein adsorption assays and blood contacting experiments, and an enzyme immunoassay was developed to detect E. coli in order to assess the level of bacterial adhesion to these biomaterials. Polymers of this type were shown to be very useful as coating materials for improving the biocompatibility of, or reducing the levels of adherent bacteria to medical devices.

We used FEM to explore the microscopic debonding mechanism of the dentin/hybrid layer/resin adhesive interface. The stress status of the local material was used as an index to judge whether the adhesive interface would develop a debonding mechanism. To generate the local stress concentration, the thermal boundary condition was applied to the model which has the phenomenon of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch. The thermal boundary condition was used to emulate a previous study conducted with a laser thermoacoustic technique (LTAT). The materials, Scotchbond MP, Optibond, and Tenure bonding systems, used in the previous experiment were also tested in this study. The results show that interfacial debonding in the finite element model occurred through the hybrid layer for both the Scotchbond MP and Tenure systems, as well as within the adhesive layer itself for the Optibond system. These findings are compatible with observations by SEM obtained by LTAT. Another transformed model was created to test the ""elastic cavity wall"" concept. The result also confirms the importance of the elastic cavity wall concept. These compatible results between FEM and LTAT indicate that FEM can be a very useful supplement to thermoacoustic testing.

The novel and low-cost electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) technique provides an effective approach to incorporate various biomaterials on substrate surfaces, and gives great opportunity to develop unique biocompatible materials with well-controlled interfaces between the living system and the implanted material. This paper presents the design, synthesis, and characterization of multilayer thin films fabricated layer-by-layer by the ESA process using ceramics, polymers and fuctionalized fullerenes as candidate biomaterials. Preliminary tests on such fabricated ESA multilayer films were also conducted, including contact angle surface characterization, and in vitro protein adsorption studies with bovine albumin using Fourier Transform Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (FT-IRAS).

Surface passivation of semiconductor and glass surfaces with thin organic films can attenuate the adhesion of proteins and cells that lead to biofilm formation and biofouling of fluidic structures. We have examined the adhesion of glial cells and serum albumin proteins to microfabricated glass and semiconductor surfaces coated with self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) and N-(triethoxysilylpropyl)-O-polyethylene oxide urethane (TESP), to evaluate the biocompatibility and surface passivation those coatings provide. These films were exposed to solutions containing serum albumin proteins (4 mg/mL), glial cells in culturing media, and glial cells under fluid flow. While the OTMS surface resisted cell spreading and growth under culture conditions, the same surface induced biofouling in a cell flow experiment with a microfluidic structure. Interestingly, the TESP surface, which was supportive of cell adhesion and proliferation under cell culturing conditions, effectively passivated the microfluidic structure to cell adhesion and biofouling.

The final structure and form of the inorganic material is in some way controlled by the nature of the specific organic entities present. This manifests itself in the initiation of the growth, by providing the appropriate matrix in which the inorganic material forms and/or by providing a ""defect"" base such that the inorganic crystal packing may be appropriately perturbed. Working with proteins is not necessarily the best or easiest way to understand a physical process and over past years people have turned to simple organic molecules, surfactants, small biological moieties and organic substrates in order to determine, at least in part, the import of organic/inorganic interactions during the growth of the inorganic material. As one example of these additives, surfactants, which represent approximately 50% of the cell membrane, display a diverse and vast array of geometrical forms in aqueous solution, many of which bare striking resemblance to biominerals, albeit on considerably smaller length scales. They also have the ability to associate in solution with inorganic material precursors, such as calcium ions. Hence, while they may not be the main driving force in the formation of biominerals, they are certainly present during the process and may, when used as model systems, allow us some way into the world of nanomaterials. Surfactants, a series of simple alcohols and carboxylic acids, and proteins extracted from the spines of adult sea urchins, have been used by our group to study the fori-nation of calcium carbonate based inorganic materials. The growth of the calcium carbonate is significantly affected by the inclusions, with deviations varying from simple stepped growth to the formation of curved surfaces.","Univ Otago, Dept Chem, Dunedin, New Zealand","McGrath, YM (reprint author), Univ Otago, Dept Chem, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",,,"Wilbanks, Sigurd/0000-0001-7565-8913; McGrath, Kathryn/0000-0003-3531-0562",,,,12,1,1,0,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4320-4,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2001.0,4590,,,,,,14,25,,10.1117/12.454624,,,,12,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Engineering; Materials Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BU25E,WOS:000175475300003,,,,,2019-02-25

Application of molecular thickness coatings of biologically active macromolecules provides predictable interfacial control over interactions with biological media. The covalent surface immobilization of polysaccharides, proteins, and synthetic oligopeptides can be achieved via ultrathin interfacial bonding layers deposited by gas plasma methods, and the multistep coating schemes are verified by XPS analyses. Interactions between biomolecular coatings and biological fluids are studied by MALDI mass spectrometry and ELISA assays. Using a colloid-modified AFM tip, quantitative measurement of interfacial forces is achieved. Comparison with theoretical predictions allows elucidation of the key interfacial forces that operate between surfaces and approaching macromolecules. In this way, it is possible to unravel the fundamental information required for the guided design and optimization of biologically active nanoscale coatings that confer predictable properties to synthetic carriers.

Many of these applications require patterns of specific proteins that allow subsequent two-dimensionally controlled cell attachment. The ideal technique would allow the deposition of specific protein patterns in areas where cell attachment is required, with complete prevention of unspecific protein adsorption in areas where cells are not supposed to attach. In our study, collagen I was used as an example for an extracellular matrix protein known to support the attachment of bovine corneal epithelial cells. An allylamine plasma polymer was deposited on a silicon wafer substrate, followed by grafting of poly(ethylene oxide). Two-dimensional control over the surface chemistry was achieved using a 248 nm excimer laser. Results obtained by XPS and AFM show that the combination of extremely low-fouling surfaces with excimer laser ablation can be used effectively for the production of spatially controlled protein patterns with a resolution of less than 1 mum. Furthermore, it was shown that bovine corneal epithelial cell attachment followed exactly the created protein patterns.

It is not observed any photoinduced formation of red shifted species at 660 nm for both types, of films as it is observed for corresponding pigments in water suspension.

Comparing materials under equivalent flow conditions, S. aureus attach to stainless steel and titanium with equal strength and more strongly than to Thermanox. For fibroblasts, detachment strength from all materials was similar. Fibroblast detachment strength from these biomaterials substantially decreases with time at equal flow rates and increases with flow rate at equal exposure times. Detachment strength is very similar for 3T3 and L929 fibroblasts on Thermanox for equivalent flow rate/time combinations, though enhanced adhesion of 3T3 cells was often noted for metals.

Photopolymerizations may provide many advantages for fabricating new biomaterials for the TMJ and may address some of the notable differences between the TMJ and other articulations. Specifically, the feasibility of trans-tissue (i.e. through the skin) photopolymerizations may yield less-invasive surgical procedures. Also, novel 3-dimensional photoprocessing techniques may be used to fabricate patient-specific alloplastic devices for improved compliance and efficacy. Finally, the mild conditions necessary for photopolymerizations make the reaction ideal for encapsulating cells with the potential to create constructs for tissue engineering, which may be beneficial for disk replacement therapies.

The surfaces of different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene have been characterized-including during the glass transition and when mechanically stretched. Copolymers that have hard and soft segments with different glass transition temperatures show phase separation, an effect of hydrogen bonding between the hard and soft segments, that influences their adhesive and friction properties. AFM and SFG show that low surface energy additives migrate to the surface and alter the surface mechanical properties. Polymers, where the chemical nature of the end groups is different from the backbone, show surface segregation of the hydrophobic part of the chain in air and the hydrophilic part in water. Likewise, in miscible polymer blends, surface segregation of the more hydrophobic component in air and the more hydrophilic component in water is observed.

The Escherichia coli (MC1061 and JM109) strains, used as negative controls, adhered poorly to FN immobilized on microtiter wells (adherence indices of 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 0.03 +/- 0.01 10(5) CFU/well, respectively). Two P. aeruginosa strains (NK125502 and ER82483) were highly adherent to FN (adherence indices of 3.22 +/- 0.75 10(5) and 3.08 +/- 1.42 10(5) CFU/well, respectively), the two others (ER98513 and ER92581) adhered less efficiently (adherence indices of 0.91 +/- 0.05 10(5) and 0.45 +/- 0.23 10(5) CFU/well, respectively). The two P. fluorescens strains (MFO and ER74508) were highly adherent to fibronectin (adherence indices of 7.06 +/- 1.00 10(5) and 2.08 +/- 0.67 10(5) CFU/well, respectively). Cefsulodin was the only antimicrobial agent tested that decreased the FN adherence of the majority of the strains: decrease in adherence highly significant (p < 0.01) for the P. fluorescens MFO strain, significant (p < 0.05) for the P. aeruginosa NK125502, ER98513 and the P. fluorescens ER74508 strains, and not significant for the P: aeruginosa ER92581 strain. The effects of chloramphenicol and polymyxin B on the adherence of Pseudomonas were strain dependent. Gentamicin had no statistically significant effect on bacterial adherence. We conclude that, in addition to its antibacterial activity, cefsulodin could be effective in preventing the adherence of fluorescent Pseudomonas to FN, an important property in the presence of injured epithelium and coated biomaterials.

In this regard amino functional groups play a key role. They provide an excellent basis for subsequent modifications with specific biomolecules. It would be of great value to get an amino functionalization independent of the specific material in use. The paper reports on an investigation concerning the feasibility of such an universal plasma functionalization procedure, Two different downstream microwave plasma sources were taken to apply a procedure, which was developed for high-grade modification of polystyrene (PS), to a number of other polymers including polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polyethylenenaphthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene, (PE), (PMMA) and fluorinated polymers. In many cases, very similar results were obtained. At maximum of 5% of the surface were covered by nitrogen functional groups. In some cases, about 50% of total nitrogen functional groups,were amino groups. The results suggest that a downstream ammonia plasma treatment indeed is a fairly universal method for high performance amino functionalization or polymeric biomaterials.","Inst Niedertemp Plasmaphys, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Schroder, K (reprint author), Inst Niedertemp Plasmaphys, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",,"Meyer-Plath, Asmus/E-4573-2011","Meyer-Plath, Asmus/0000-0001-9037-7706",,,,17,69,69,2,19,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 BERLIN, GERMANY",0863-1042,,,CONTRIB PLASM PHYS,Contrib.

Since not all species of a given analyte have the same detrimental impact on the environment, new analytical devices and techniques are required to distinguish between the different species of a pollutant or different groups of pollutants. This paper describes analytical techniques based on biomaterials that are toxically sensitive to pollutants. This approach permits the biomonitoring of certain compounds by looking at their toxic properties. Although these techniques are based on a sound analytical strategy, their applications are limited because most of the interactions between the biological material and the analyte are irreversible. Additionally, the immobilised biological material has a limited stability. Several biomonitoring strategies based on electrochemical biosensing are discussed here and how to recover the bioactivity of biosensing system, both in discrete and automated procedures, is also reviewed.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Quim, Grup Sensors & Biosensors, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain","Alegret, S (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Quim, Grup Sensors & Biosensors, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.",salegret@gsb.uab.es,,,,,,68,10,10,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Absolute controls had laparotomy only, controls had mesenteric window wounding, test groups had the insertion of either a thread of collagen, polyglactin 910, polyglycolic acid salt, silk or of a titanium clip. We considered the percentage area of the mesenteric window covered by neovessels. After 7 days, negligible angiogenesis was found in absolute controls, significant angiogenesis in controls, collagen, polyglactin 910 and polyglycolic acid salt treated rats, without differences between treatments. A significant increase of angiogenesis in comparison to the control group was found in rats treated with silk and titanium. Ultramicroscopy of the neovessels showed specific changes of their architecture in titanium-treated rats. In conclusion, angiogenesis during wound healing is differently influenced by the suture material used, Silk and titanium stimulated angiogenesis in a different way. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG.

The model is used to clarify and relate the impact of different structural changes, such as collagen fiber debonding and collagen fiber weakening, to changes in macro-level tissue mechanical properties. The model will ultimately serve as a guide for the development of key experiments for fatigue damage assessment of novel chemical treatment technologies.

We report on composite materials of polyesters (polyglycolide and polylactide) with bone-like amorphous carbonated calcium phosphate that exhibit variable porosities (from compact to 80 vol%). The mechanical properties show the expected decrease with increasing porosity but are still in a sufficient range. Enhanced degradation at 70 degreesC was used to study the bulk erosion behavior. The erosion rate was higher for macroporous polyglycolide (400 mum pore diameter), compact polyglycolide and lower for microporous polyglycolide (<1 mum pore diameter) and poly-L-lactide.

Two generic properties of Nitinol, thermally induced shape recovery and superelasticity, are successfully employed for medical uses. However, several aspects of the alloys' short and long term efficacy have yet to be comprehensively determined, especially parameters relating to surface and corrosion performance, The present review surveys studies carried out internationally over about the past 10 years aiming at an improved understanding of Nitinol's surface, corrosion, and biocompatibility features. A critical survey is given of the surface condition of alloys modified using various advanced techniques, oxidised in air-water-steam mixtures, and passivated using chemical-electrochemical procedures, Surface parameters and their importance to the improvement of Nitinol's corrosion resistance and biological performance are discussed on the basis of XPS, Auger, SEM, and BSEM studies. In vivo and in vitro corrosion studies using potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, and scratch tests on as cast alloys, wire, and actual devices are surveyed. The effects of stress, strain, heat treatment, microstructure, precipitates, and alloy composition on corrosion are evaluated and compared with data for stainless steels, cobalt base alloys, and titanium. Release of nickel, observed in vitro and in vivo, is also surveyed. Biocompatibility aspects are briefly discussed with emphasis on their possible correlation with surface condition.","Iowa State Univ, Inst Phys Res & Technol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Shabalovskaya, SA (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Inst Phys Res & Technol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,138,71,75,2,26,MANEY PUBLISHING,LEEDS,"HUDSON RD, LEEDS LS9 7DL, ENGLAND",0950-6608,,,INT MATER REV,Int.

For same components the higher surface roughness is preferred to increase the adherence and anchorage between the implant and the bone. In this work sandblasting prior to the oxidation is used to increase the surface roughness of the oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) FeCrAl alloy. The effect of sandblasting on its oxidation and corrosion behaviour is studied. As a comparison, polished samples are also studied. The alloy treated at 1 100 degreesC generates a dense alpha -alumina layer which thickness increases with increasing exposure time, being the values somewhat lower for the sandblasted samples. Impedance diagrams obtained for sandblasted samples preoxidised for 1 and 3 h show impedance values at the lowest frequency two orders of magnitude lower than those for polished samples. This decrease in the impedance value can be attributed to the presence of paths or fine cracks in the alumina layer that communicate the aggressive medium with the metallic substrate. Spallation of the alumina layer in preoxidised sandblasted samples has been detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for treatment times of 10 and 100 h. Despite this loss of the scale integrity, the corrosion behaviour is good.","CSIC, CENIM, Ctr Nacl Invest Met, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Garcia-Alonso, MC (reprint author), CSIC, CENIM, Ctr Nacl Invest Met, Avda Gregorio Amo 8, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",escudero@cenim.csic.es,"Garcia-Alonso, Maria Cristina/K-3779-2014; Gonzalez Carrasco, Jose Luis/A-7971-2008; Escudero, Maria Lorenza/L-7113-2014","Garcia-Alonso, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-0275-4626; Escudero, Maria Lorenza/0000-0002-2181-448X; Gonzalez-Carrasco, Jose Luis/0000-0003-2004-4505",,,,29,3,3,1,6,IRON STEEL INST JAPAN KEIDANREN KAIKAN,TOKYO,"TEKKO KAIKAN-5F, 3-2-10, NIHONBASHI-KAYABACHO, TOKYO, CHUO-KU 103-0025, JAPAN",0915-1559,1347-5460,,ISIJ INT,ISIJ Int.,,2001.0,41,1,,,,,56,62,,10.2355/isijinternational.41.56,,,,7,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,396FF,WOS:000166625100008,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Surfactants available commercially vary widely in composition and biophysical properties. The present paper studies the ultrastructure of three exogenous surfactants used for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome, namely, Survanta(TM), ALEC(TM) and Exosurf Neonatal(TM) with respect to their ability to form liposomes using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy. Liposomal organisation is more obvious in Exosurf than in Survanta and is most pronounced in ALEC. ALEC forms closed regular liposomes with an onionring-like internal bilayer arrangement. Survanta forms open membranous structures with wavy ribbon-like membranes. The complex membrane-like structures seen with Survanta may be due to the interaction of lipids with surfactant-specific proteins present in this surfactant which is derived from natural lung extracts and might indicate superior spreading at the lipid-water interface. Artificial protein-free surfactants (ALEC and Exosurf) did not appear to form these open membranous structures. Further study of the ultrastructure of possible biomaterials as surfactants could help in the development of new, improved artificial protein-free surfactants with open membranous structures that might facilitate spreading at the air-liquid interface of lungs.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Mumbai 400076, India",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0885-3282,,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

AMPAC, a semiempirical computer program that provides quantum mechanical information for chemical structures, was applied to three series of reference chemicals. a set of methacrylates. a set of aromatic and a set of aliphatic epoxy compounds. QSAR models were developed using this chemical information together with mutagenicity data (Salmonella TA100, Ames Test). CODESSA. a QSAR program that calculates quantum chemical descriptor from information generated by AMPAC and statistically matches these descriptors with observed biological properties was used. QSARs were developed which had r(2) values exceeding 0.90 for each study series. These QSARs were used to accurately predict the mutagenicity of BISGMA, a monomer commonly used in dentistry, and two epoxy monomers with developing use in dentistry, GY-281 and UVR-6105. The Q-QSAR quantum mechanical descriptors correctly predicted the level of mutagenicity for all three compounds. The descriptors in the correlation equation painted to components of structure that may contribute to mutagenesis. The QSARs also provided 'dose windows' for testing mutagenicity, circumventing the need for extensive dose exploration in the laboratory.

For long-term testing of new biomaterials as artificial basement membrane substitutes, it is important to simulate this fluid gradient. Individually-selected biomaterials can be placed in tissue carriers and in gradient containers, where different media are superfused. Epithelia growing on the tissue carriers form a physiological barrier during the whole culture period. Frequently however, pressure differences between the luminal and basal compartments occur. This is caused by a unilateral accumulation of gas bubbles in the container compartments resulting in tissue damage. Consequently, the occurence of gas bubbles has to be minimized. Air bubbles in the perfusion culture medium preferentially acumulate at sites where different materials come into contact. The first development is new screw caps for media bottles, specifically designed to allow fluid contact with only the tube and not the cap material. The second development is the separation of remaining gas bubbles from the liquid phase in the medium using newly-developed gas expander modules. By the application of these new tools, the yield of embryonic renal collecting duct epithelia with intact barrier function on a fragile natural support material can be significantly increased compared to earlier experiments.","Univ Regensburg, Dept Anat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany","Minuth, WW (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Anat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",,,,,,,25,11,11,0,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Much effort has been devoted to develop new materials that do not activate or deteriorate the complement system. The present work is aimed at revealing the mode of reactions of anionic poly(2-acrylamido 2-methylpropane sulfonate) grafted on polystyrene bead (PAMPS-g-bead) with serum complement. Complement activity assay, determination of complement proteins levels, and immunoblot analysis were carried out for sera pretreated with PAMPS-g-beads. The results clearly showed that, when PAMPS-g-bends were incubated with serum, those beads adsorbed several complement proteins, i.e. C1q, factor D, factor P, C6, and C8, but the generation of activation fragments of complement components was not observed. Especially, factor D was most effectively removed from serum, resulting in potential inhibition of the alternative pathway. A larger amount of PAMPS-g-beads was needed to decrease the serum CH50 level. That may be caused by removal of C6. Although some polyanions, such as dextran sulfate, were reported to activate the complement system, the obtained results indicate that the PAMPS-g-bead is not an activator of the complement pathway, but acts as an adsorbent of complement components. One possible clinical application of the PAMPS-g-beads is adsorption of serum factor D by extracorporeal treatment of patients with renal failure with a high level of factor D, because the increased quantity of factor D in serum may cause consistent activation of the alternative pathway.","Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; Osaka Prefectural Coll Hlth Sci, Osaka 5838555, Japan; Suzuka Univ Med Sci, Suzuka, Mie 5100293, Japan","Iwata, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Sakyo Ku, 53 Kawahara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",,,,,,,26,7,7,1,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The surface properties of artificial biomaterials have been thought as the key factors which mediate the interactions between the biological environment and biomaterial itself, In this study, the sulfonation was directly performed on the chitosan membrane surface. The chitosan membrane was surface-sulfonated by reactions with sulfur-pyridine trioxide complex (SO3/pyridine) in H2O solution and N,N-sulfur-dimethylformamide trioxide complex (SO3/DMF) in DMF. Blood compatibility was evaluated by an in vitro platelet adhesion assay. The surface reaction Of SO3/pyridine in aqueous acid medium yields N,O-sulfated chitosan with cationic NH3+ groups, After neutralization, this surface has been shown to induce a low degree of platelet adhesion and activation. When the surface-sulfonation is performed in an aqueous alkaline medium, although the degree of sulfonation is lower than the samples above, the N-sulfated chitosan significantly reduced the adhesion and activation of platelets. For the acidic SO3/DMF reaction system, N,O-sulfated chitosan was obtained with a high extent of sulfonation and cationic NH3+ groups. On this surface 3 fully spread platelets and some platelet aggregates were found instead. This may be attributed to the ionic interactions between the platelets membrane surface and the cationic groups on the modified chitosan membrane.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan","Lin, JC (reprint author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,"Lin, Jui-Che/C-8230-2012","Lin, Jui-Che/0000-0003-4436-655X",,,,44,18,19,0,12,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The contact involved adding heparinized whole blood to small diameter tubes that were connected to two arms extending from a rocking platform. For all surfaces (polyethylene, polypropylene, Silastic (TM), PVA hydrogel) tested there was strong evidence of platelet activation in the bulk blood: platelet-derived microparticles, procoagulant platelet membranes and soluble P-selectin levels. Flow cytometric quantification of microparticles (MPs) was highly sensitive and entailed the direct determination of microparticle concentrations as opposed to the traditional quantification of microparticle percentages (relative to total number of MPs and platelets). Whole blood contact with polypropylene surfaces led to the greatest drops in bulk platelet counts and also to the lowest increases in microparticle concentrations. Flow cytometry was also used to assess procoagulant levels (annexin V binding) within a light scatter region known to contain platelets and some large microparticles. All surfaces were noted to generate a significant procoagulant population that was, based on forward light scatter, mostly very small platelets or large microparticles. In contrast, most of the P-selectin positive platelets were averaged sized. Lastly, all surfaces generated soluble P-selectin levels that were approximately double the level (25 ng ml(-1)) noted in the resting whole blood samples. In addition to our previous reports, these findings support the observation that there is strong evidence of platelet activation in the bulk that we anticipate will ultimately lead to more relevant in vitro testing of the compatibility of platelets towards materials.","Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5G 2M1, Canada","Gemmell, CH (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5G 2M1, Canada.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL24020],,,21,31,31,0,8,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Monocyte and macrophage interactions with biomaterial surfaces are thought to be mediated by adsorbed adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen and fibronectin. Non-fouling surfaces that minimize protein adsorption may therefore minimize monocyte adhesion, activation, and the foreign body response. Radio-frequency glow discharge plasma deposition (RF-GDPD) of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tetraglyme) was used to produce polyethylene oxide (PEO)-like coatings on a fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) surface. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and static time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were used to characterize the surface chemistry of tetraglyme coating. Fibrinogen adsorption to the tetraglyme surface was measured with I-125-labeled fibrinogen and ToF-SIMS. Adsorption of fibrinogen to plasma deposited tetraglyme was less than 10 ng cm(-2), a 20-fold decrease compared to untreated FEP or tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Monocyte adhesion to plasma deposited tetraglyme was significantly lower than adhesion to FEP or TCPS. In addition, when the surfaces were preadsorbed with fibrinogen, fibronectin, or blood plasma, monocyte adhesion to plasma deposited tetraglyme after 2 h or 1 day was much lower than adhesion to FEP. RF-GDPD tetraglyme coating provides a promising approach to make non-fouling biomaterials that can inhibit non-specific material-host interactions and reduce the foreign body response.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,51,66,70,0,11,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Depending on the initial oligomer chemistry and the resultant polymer hydrophobicity, protein adsorption and osteoblast function varied significantly between the various lactic acid based polymer chemistries. Results were compared to control polymers of tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and 50: 50 poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA).

IR and SEM analysis of the outer erosion and inner intact zone revealed that the outer zone degraded more rapidly than the inner zone. Such results were similar to that in vitro. All the studied poly(ester-anhydrides) produced mild inflammatory reactions and tissue encapsulation by layers of fibroblastic cells in vivo. Observation of liver and kidney tissue by light microscopy suggested the hydrolytic products of the studied poly(ester-anhydrides) had no harmful effects on the normal tissue/organs.

In this study, the effects of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) treatment on acellularized ovine carotid arteries were studied under two different pH conditions: (i) pH controlled at an optimal value of 5.5; and (ii) a simpler, but industrially significant, uncontrolled pH system. A multimode approach was employed involving biochemical assays, thermomechanical, tensile, and shear mechanical testing, and irt vitro enzyme degradation analyses. EDC treatment decreased the hoop tangent modulus of acellular matrix (ACM) arterial grafts measured at 20 kPa of stress regardless of pH control. Extensibility of ACM arterial grafts measured at 20 kPa of stress was reduced after EDC treatment with pH control only. In contrast, shear stiffness of ACM arterial grafts increased to a greater degree under crosslinking without pH control (21 x compared to 14 x with pH control). Thermomechanical analyses revealed that EDC cross-linking with pH control also increased the collagen denaturation temperature of ACM arteries to a greater degree (a rise of 24.3 +/- 0.6 degreesC vs. 21.7 +/- 0.7 degreesC for no pH control), whereas cross-linking without pH control consumed a larger amount of lysine residues after 3 h of treatment. Most interestingly, both EDC treatments were equally effective in stabilizing ACM arteries against multiple degradative enzymes in vitro. The observed differences between EDC treatments under different pH conditions are attributed to differences in the location and types of the exogenous cross-links formed. The absence of pH control may have favored the formation of interfibrillar or intermolecular cross-links in collagen as well as involvement of other extracellular matrix components (proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans), Furthermore, it may be emphasized that the location or type of cross-links differentially affected the mechanical behavior of treated materials without affecting the increase in resistance to enzymatic degradation.

Osteoblasts seem to participate directly in this phenomenon. This paper investigates in vitro cellular response to the wear particles from the metal substrate and ceramic covering (alpha -alumina) of a new titanium yttrium aluminum alloy, MA 956, that has been proposed as a biomaterial because of its exceptional mechanical and electrochemical properties. The effect of different sizes (10 and 80 mum) of MA 956 and alpha -alumina particles on osteoblast function was studied in primary human bone cell cultures. Cells were harvested from trabecular bone fragments obtained during knee arthroplasty. Osteoblastic cell response to the particles was measured by assaying C-terminal type I procollagen (PICP), alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin secretion, with and without 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation, in the cell-conditioned medium. Both sizes of MA 956 and alpha -alumina particles decreased PICP secretion in nonstimulated osteoblastic cells, but this secretion was not affected in the cultures stimulated with 1.25(OH)(2)D-3. Only the 10 mum alpha -alumina particles inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in 1.25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated and nonstimulated cultures. The rise in osteocalcin levels after 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation was lower in the presence of the 10 mum MA 956 particles than in the presence of alpha -alumina particles. Although both materials seem to ha ve directly affected in vitro osteoblastic cell function, the increase in osteocalcin levels after 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation was lower after exposure to MA 956 particles than the increase observed after exposure to alpha -alumina particles. Therefore, it does not seem that osteocalcin stimulated bone resorption, suggesting that MA 956 would be less likely to provoke osteolysis.

Two photocrosslinkable polysaccharides composed of alginate and hyaluronan are described that upon photolysis form soft, flexible, and viscoelastic hydrogels. The degree of methacrylate modification and thus covalent affects mechanical properties such as swelling, compression, and creep compliance. Significant swelling is observed in aqueous solution; these hydrogels can swell up to 14 times their dry weight. Both hydrogels exhibit low phase angles and I G* I values indicative of viscoelastic materials. The hyaluronan based hydrogel is stronger and more resilient than the corresponding alginate gel. SEM and AFM studies on both hydrogels show smooth and uniform surfaces at the macroscopic level with salient features observed only on the nanometer scale. Rapid polymerization by an optical trigger allows for controlled in situ photopolymerization in a minimally invasive manner, indicating that these hydrogels are relevant for biomedical applications such as sealing wounds and reconstructing soft tissues.

We report on the covalent decoration of silk films with integrin recognition sequences (RGD) as well as parathyroid hormone (PTH, 1-34 amino acids) and a modified PTH 1-34 (mPTH) involved in the induction of bone formation. Osteoblast-like cell (Saos-2) responses to the decorated silk films indicate that the proteins serve as suitable bone-inducing matrices. Osteoblast-like cell adhesion was significantly increased on RGD and PTH compared to plastic, mPTH, and the control peptide RAD. At 2 weeks of culture, message levels of alkaline phosphatase were similar on all substrates, but by 4 weeks, alkaline phosphatase mRNA was greatest on RGD. At 2 weeks of culture, alpha1(I) procollagen mRNA was elevated on silk, RGD, RAD, and PTH, and hardly detectable on mPTH and plastic. However, by 4 weeks RGD demonstrated the highest level compared to the other substrates. Osteocalcin message levels detected by RT-PCR were greatest on RGD at both time points. Calcification was also significantly elevated on RGD compared to the other substrates with an increase in number and size of the mineralized nodules in culture. Thus, RGD covalently decorated silk appears to stimulate osteoblast-based mineralization in vitro.

Geometry is crucially important for the:scaffold in bone and joint tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to elucidate principles of geometry of matrices in designing new scaffolds and matrices for use in reconstruction of bone and joints. Methods: More than ten biomaterials with different geometries, including a unique device of honeycomb-shaped hydroxyapatite, were combined with BMPs of recombinant (rhBMP-2) or natural bovine origin (S300 BMP cocktail) and implanted subcutaneously into LF-week-old Wistar-King rats. The implanted pellets were removed at 1-4 weeks and analyzed for bone and cartilage formation by histological and biochemical methods. Results: BMP-induced bone and cartilage induction was highly dependent on the geometric properties of the carrier. Some carriers such as porous particles or blocks of hydroxyapatite induced osteogenesis directly, without detectable chondrogenesis, whereas other carriers such as fibrous glass membrane induced cartilage exclusively. Still other carriers induced mostly cartilage followed by bone formation. Solid particles of hydroxyapatite and fibrous glass membrane with too tight a meshwork did not induce bone or cartilage. The optimal pore size for bone-forming efficacy in porous blocks of hydroxyapatite was a diameter of 300-400 mum. In straight tunnel structures with various diameters in honeycomb-shaped hydroxyapatite, tunnels with smaller diameters (90-120 mum) induced cartilage followed by bone formation, whereas those with larger diameters (350 mum) induced bone formation directly within the tunnels. Conclusions: BMP carriers were classified into three types: bone-inducing, cartilage-inducing, and cartilage-bone-inducing. From the analysis of causative factors inducing osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in the BMP system, we concluded that the geometry of the carrier is crucially important and vasculature-inducing geometry should be considered in designing effective scaffolds for bone formation. We propose a classification of geometry of the artificial extracellular matrices that is useful for designing a scaffold for tissue engineering of bone and related tissues. Clinical Relevance: Conventional requisites of the BMP carriers for clinical use have mainly concerned the affinities of carriers with cells and biomolecules and their mechanical strength. The vasculature-inducing geometry of carriers adds a new criterion in designing systems for effective bone and joint reconstruction. The geometries of porous structures-their sizes, continuity, and straightness as verified by hydroxyapatite in this study-will be applicable for other biomaterials for clinical reconstruction therapy.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Dent Sci, Dept Oral Hlth Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan","Kuboki, Y (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Dent Sci, Dept Oral Hlth Sci, Kita Ku, N-13,W-7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan.",,,,,,,31,188,207,4,34,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

In this review, we compare the osteoinductive effects of different biomaterial delivery systems that have or have not been pretreated with BMPs/OPs. In particular, we focus on the geometric induction of bone formation by sintered porous hydroxyapatite (SPHA) discs with concavities on their planar surfaces, which elicit bone formation without exogenously applied BMPs/OPs. Methods: Heterotopic bone formation was examined by bilaterally implanting 100-mg pellets of a collagenous carrier containing BMPs/OPs in the rectus abdominis muscle of the adult baboon. Orthotopic bone formation was examined by implanting 1 g of a collagenous carrier containing BMPs/OPs into two full-thickness critical-sized 25-mm-diameter defects on each side of the calvaria of adult baboons. The BMPs/OPs whose effects were examined included recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1), recombinant human transforming growth factor-pr (rhTGF-beta1), rhTGF-beta2, and porcine platelet derived transforming growth factor-beta1 (pTGF-beta1). Tissue from the rectus abdominis muscle was harvested 30 or 90 days after implantation. Tissue from the orthotopic calvarial model was examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after implantation. To demonstrate the effect of surface geometry on bone induction, hydroxyapatite powders were sintered to form solid discs with a series of concavities on the planar surfaces of the SPHA discs. The discs were either pretreated with exogenous rhOP-1 or not treated with exogenous OF-1. They were then implanted heterotopically or orthotopically into calvarial defects. Bone formation was evaluated histologically in undecalcified sections stained with Goldner's trichrome stain or 0.1% toluidine blue. Results: Naturally derived BMPs/OPs or rhOP-1 in a collagenous carrier elicit heterotopic bone formation and the complete healing of 25-mm-diameter critical-sized defects by day 90 following implantation. Binary applications of TGF-beta1 together with rhOP-1 in the collagen carrier induced massive endochondral ossicles in heterotopic sites and bone formation in calvarial defects. pTGF-beta1, rhTGF-beta1, and rhTGF-beta2 are powerful inducers of heterotopic endochondral bone formation but elicit limited bone formation in calvarial defects. SPHA discs pretreated with rhOP-1 elicited extensive bone formation in both heterotopic and orthotopic sites. However, SPHA without rhOP-1 also elicited bone formation in heterotopic and orthotopic sites and complete healing of the calvarial defects. Conclusion: We have prepared SPHA discs with concavities on their planar surfaces that induce bone formation in heterotopic or orthotopic critical-sized calvarial defects without exogenously applied BMPs/OPs. This biomaterial induces bone formation by intrinsic osteoinductivity regulated by the geometry of the substratum. The incorporation of specific biological activities into biomaterials by manipulating the geometry of the substratum, defined as geometric induction of bone formation, may make it possible to engineer morphogenetic responses for therapeutic osteogenesis in clinical contexts. Clinical Relevance: We have implemented a clinical trial using naturally derived BMPs/OPs extracted and purified from bovine bone matrices and implanted in craniofacial defects in humans. In addition, the discovery that specific geometric and surface characteristics of sintered hydroxyapatites can induce intrinsic osteoinductivity in primates paves the way for formulation and therapeutic application of porous substrata designed to obtain predictable intrinsic osteoinductivity in clinical contexts.","Univ Witwatersrand, MRC, Bone Res Unit, Sch Med, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, MRC, Bone Res Unit, Sch Med, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,60,43,46,1,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

In combination with biomaterials, these proteins can be used in a clinical setting as bone-graft substitutes to promote bone repair. Collagen from animal sources has previously been the preferred carrier material in animal experiments. More recently, synthetic biodegradable polymers have been tested as a delivery vehicle for osteoinductive agents. In earlier studies performed in our laboratory, it was found that the polylactic acid homopolymers (PLA650) and poly-D,L-lactic acid-polyethylene glycol block copolymers (PLA650-PEG200) are viscous liquids that can be used as BMP delivery systems. Methods: To obtain new PLA-PEG polymers that exhibit greater plasticity, the molecular sizes of PLA and PEG segments in the copolymer chains were increased. Plastic PLA-PEG polymers with various molecular sizes and PLA/PEG ratios were synthesized, mixed with recombinant human (rh) BMP-2, and implanted into the dorsal muscles of mice for 3 weeks to evaluate their capacity to elicit new bone formation. To compare the plastic PLA-PEG polymer with the liquid PLA650-PEG200 polymer, these two polymers were combined with rhBMP-2, implanted, and harvested after 3 weeks. Bone mineral content (BMC), bone area, and bone mineral density (BMD) of the ectopic new bone were measured by means of single energy X-ray absorptiometry (SXA). Results: All of the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 implants with 10 or 20 mug of rhBMP-2 showed new bone formation. In contrast, little or no bone formation was seen in other plastic PLA-PEG implants with rhBMP-2. Control implants that lacked rhBMP-2 did not show new bone formation. Radiographic and histologic examinations showed that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 implants with rhBMP-2 harvested 3 weeks after implantation had normal bone characteristics with hematopoietic marrow and osseous trabeculae. SXA analysis showed that the values for bone mineral content (BMC), bone area, and bone mineral density (BMD) of new bone resulting from the use of plastic PLA6,500-PEG3,000 polymers with rhBMP-2 were significantly higher than those obtained with the liquid PLA650-PEG200 polymers (p < 0.001 for each of the three values). Conclusions: These results indicate that the PLA6,500-PEG3000 block copolymer with plastic properties works effectively as a BMP delivery system. These data suggest that the total molecular size and ratio of PLA size to PEG size is an essential factor in determining the efficacy of a BMP delivery system. After implantation, it is possible that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 pellets might have absorbed tissue fluids and become swollen, resulting in bone formation that exceeded the size of the original implants. This expansion characteristic is a potentially beneficial property, given the intended practical application of the polymer in the repair of bone defects.

Biomaterials used in delivery systems also play a critical role in supporting the osteoinductive activity of BMPs, attributable to the controlled presentation of the BMPs to target cells. Despite extensive preclinical studies, the factors contributing to local rhBMP pharmacokinetics remain to be elucidated. Methods: The rhBMP pharmacokinetics were studied in a rat subcutaneous implant and in an intramuscular injection model. In situ levels of rhBMPs were quantitated with use of I-125-labeled tracers. The effects of protein structural features and the nature of the biomaterial implant were explored. Osteoinduction by biomaterial+rhBMP combinations was assessed by a semiquantitative, histology-based bone score. Results: With the use of rhBMP-2, rhBMP-4, and an N truncated rhBMP-2, the protein isoelectric point was found critical for the initial retention of rhBMPs in an implant. Osteoinduction studies carried out in parallel indicated that rhBMPs with a higher implant retention elicited more bone formation. In the clinically used collagen+rhBMP-2 device, collagen crosslinking and sterilization were most influential in rhBMP-2 retention. To increase retention at an application site, thermoreversible polymers were engineered and shown to enhance local rhBMP-2 retention, especially by injectable delivery. Conclusions: Two critical components of an osteoinductive device-namely, the biomaterial and the rhBMP-were shown to influence local protein pharmacokinetics and osteoinductive activity of the device. Designer biomaterials can provide an additional mechanism to modulate local protein pharmacokinetics. Clinical Relevance: These studies form the foundation of next-generation osteoinductive devices with improved potency at sites of desired bone regeneration and reduced side effects at other sites.","Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Biomed Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada; Genet Inst Inc, Biopharmaceut Characterizat & Anal Grp, Andover, MA 01810 USA; Genet Inst Inc, Bone Biol & Applicat Grp, Andover, MA 01810 USA; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Uludag, H (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Biomed Engn, 1098 EDC Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada.",,,,,,,23,143,148,0,7,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

But the high solubility of these materials limits their application. The addition of alumina can be used to control their solubility, but may inhibit the bonding mechanisms. In this paper, we study a bioglass in the SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5-K2O-Al2O3-MgO system. After delays of implantation from 2 to 12 months, the bioglass/bone interface is characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Bioglass dissolution can be decomposed into three steps with selective leaching. Results show that, at 2 months after implantation, the bioglass is composed of Al, Si, Ca, and P. Alumina addition increases the coating stability without inhibiting the bonding process. Complex physicochemical reactions take place at the bioglass periphery. The coating bonds to bone through a Ca-P layer on top of a pure Si-rich layer. These phenomena are associated with bioactivity properties, which occur for up to 6 months. After 12 months, the bioglass is composed of silicon, (C) 2001 Academic Press.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 02, France; Lab Phys Corpusculaire Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IN2P3, F-63177 Aubiere, France","Jallot, E (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader,BP 138, F-51685 Reims 02, France.",,,,,,,20,23,24,0,4,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0021-9797,,,J COLLOID INTERF SCI,J.

Phosphorylation was therefore envisaged as the means to enhance cellulose bioactivity. Once implanted, phosphorylated cellulose could promote the formation of calcium phosphates, having therefore closer resemblance to bone functionality and assuring a satisfactory bonding at the interface between hard tissue and biomaterial. In the present work, regenerated cellulose hydrogels were surface modified via phosphorylation. Phosphorylated materials, having varying degrees of substitution, were soaked in a Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution in order to investigate their ability to induce the formation of a calcium phosphate layer. Mineralization was assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the calcium salt of cellulose phosphates mineralized at a higher extent than materials only phosphorylated. The degree of phosphorylation influenced the extent of surface mineralization. Moderate degrees of surface phosphorylation promoted the highest extent of mineralization. This was attributed to inadequate functionality of the surface in terms of density of PO4 groups and overall surface charge, in the case of low and high phosphate contents.

However, the lack of a reproducible in vitro method that simulates clinical use makes it difficult to evaluate the lubricity of urinary catheters and other devices for urethral insertion. Therefore, this study describes a suitable method based on use of a Texture Analyzer to characterize the lubricity of such devices. The novel method was susequently applied to the evaluation of commercially-available intermittent urinary catheters. In addition, other important physicochemical properties of these catheters were examined, namely Young's modulus, degree of hydration and morphology. Catheter lubricity was quantified, using a Texture Analyzer, by measurement of the forces required for insertion and removal of the device from two model substrates, agar and mucin-coated silicone tubing. Significant differences in lubricity were identified between the commercially-available catheters, with Aquacath and Lofric exhibiting the lowest forces of insertion and removal. There were no significant differences between the extent of hydration between the catheters, with the exception of Uro-flo which exhibited the lowest hydration. Therefore, the differences in lubricity were not directly related to the extent of hydration. The forces required for insertion/removal of all catheters were markedly greater in the simulated mucin model than in the agar substrate and the former, simulated urethra model, was accepted to mimic more accurately, the in vivo situation. Significant differences were observed between the Young's Moduli of the catheter biomaterials, with Aquacath possessing the largest value. In conclusion, this study has described the use of a texture analyzer and polymeric substrates for the evaluation of biomaterial lubricity. Using these methods, Aquacath and Lofric catheters exhibited greatest lubricity. However, following additional consideration of the mechanical properties of these biomaterials, Aquacath possessed the most appropriate physicochemical properties for use in intermittent catheterization.

PEGMA macromononers of different molecular weights were used. The UV-induced graft copolymerization of PEGMA onto the plasma-pretreated NR latex films was also explored with PEGMA of different macromonomer concentrations and with different UV graft copolymerization time. The surface microstructures and compositions of the PEG-modified NR latex films were characterized by contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. In general, higher macromonomer concentration and longer UV graft copolymerization time led to a higher graft yield. Water contact angle measurements revealed that the hydrophilicity of the NR latex film surface was greatly enhanced by the grafting of the PEG chains. The NR surface with a high density of grafted PEG was very effective in reducing protein adsorption and platelet adhesion. A lower graft concentration of the high-molecular-weight PEG was more effective than a high graft concentration of the low-molecular-weight PEG in reducing protein adsorption and platelet adhesion.

The two tested biomaterials were implanted in distal femoral osseous defects in rabbits. Qualitative and quantitative histological evaluation was performed three and eight weeks after implantation to investigate bone colonization and ceramic biodegradation associated with the two bone substitutes. Both biomaterials expressed osteoconduction properties and supported the apposition of a well-mineralized lamellar newly-formed bone. Bone colonization occurred much earlier and faster for IBS than for MBCP implants, although the respective rates of newly-formed bone after eight weeks of implantation did not differ significantly. For both biomaterials, ceramic resorption occurred regularly throughout the implantation period, though to a greater extent with IBS than with MBCP implants. The associated polymer in IBS produced intergranular spaces allowing body fluids to reach each BCP ceramic granule immediately after implantation, which may have favored osteoblastic activity, new bone formation and ceramic resorption. This completely interconnected open macroporosity could account for the earlier and more satisfactory bone substitution achieved with IBS.

This study, therefore, examined the effects of oropharyngeal atmospheric conditions (5% v/v carbon dioxide) and the presence of a salivary conditioning film on both the surface properties and adherence of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis to PVC and silicone. Furthermore, the effects of the salivary conditioning film on the surface properties of these biomaterials are reported. Growth of the three Candida spp. in an atmosphere containing 5% v/v CO2 significantly increased their cell surface hydrophobicity and reduced the zeta potential of C. albicans and C. krusei yet increased the zeta potential of C. tropicalis (p <0.05). Furthermore, growth in 5% v/v CO2 decreased the adherence of C. tropicalis and C. albicans to both PVC and silicone, however, increased adherence of C. krusei (p <0.05). Pre-treatment of the microorganisms with pooled human saliva significantly decreased their cell surface hydrophobicity and increased their adherence to either biomaterial in comparison to yeast cells that had been pre-treated with PBS (p <0.05). Saliva treatment of the microorganisms had no consistent effect on microbial zeta potential. Interestingly, adherence of the three, saliva-treated Candida spp. to saliva-treated silicone and PVC was significantly lower than whenever the microorganisms and biomaterials had been treated with PBS (p <0.05). Treatment of silicone and PVC with saliva significantly altered the surface properties, notably reducing both the advancing and receding contact angles and, additionally, the microrugosity. These effects may contribute to the decreased adherence of saliva-treated microorganisms to these biomaterials. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the effects of physiological conditions within the oral cavity on the adherence of selected Candida spp. to biomaterials employed as oropharyngeal medical devices. In particular, this study has ominously shown that these materials act as substrates for yeast colonization, highlighting the need for advancements in biomaterial design. Furthermore, it is important that physiological conditions should be employed whenever biocompatibility of oropharyngeal biomaterials is under investigation.

The combination of good mechanical properties of this material and the excellent biocompatibility, the good wear and corrosion behavior of an outer alpha -alumina layer, limiting the release of ionic species and wear debris from the bulk material into the body-fluid environment, can make this material a candidate alloy for medical applications. Isothermal oxidation at 1100 degreesC in air of the alloy has led to the formation of a fine-grained, compact and adherent alpha -alumina scale. Oxide nodules rich in Ti, Y, Cr, and Fe were found on the top of the surface. In vitro electrochemical corrosion experiments showed good protective properties of the oxide scale. Moreover, no spallation of the alumina layer was observed. This feature is significant considering that the alumina layer has to withstand very high compressive stresses resulting from both growth and thermal stresses incorporated during cooling.

The synthetic hydrogels are known as poorly adhesive surfaces. In this study we demonstrated the adsorption of albumin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and epidermal growth factor to poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) and copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and potassium salt of 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate (SPMAK). The adhesion and growth of 3T3 cells and human keratinocytes on surface of these polymers was tested without and with pretreatment of polymers with heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor. The adhesion of mixture of human granulocytes and monocytes to these surfaces was also tested. The strips of both polymers were subcutaneously and intracerebrally implanted into the rat and the extent of foreign body reaction and brain biocompatibility was evaluated. The results showed the extensive adsorption of basic fibroblast growth factor and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor to copolymer containing SPMAK. However the adhesion (and growth) of cells to this type of copolymers was very low. Preadsorption of human plasma to pHEMA clearly stimulated the leukocyte adhesion in contrary to copolymer containing SPMAK. The extent of foreign-body reaction was significantly higher against the pHEMA compared to tested copolymer p(HEMA-co-SPMAK). In conclusion, the tested copolymer was a poorly adhesive substrate that is only poorly recognized by the non-specific immunity, although the adsorption of basic growth factors to this substrate is highly significant. Both polymers were well tolerated by the brain tissue. The phenotype of surrounding neurons was more close to the control neurons in the brain tissue surrounding the p(HEMA-co-SPMAK) implants.

In this work biomimetic coatings consisting either of collagen type I (for the gingiva region) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) or mineralized collagen (for the bone interface) have been developed as suitable surfaces regarding the interfaces. Additionally, using these biomimetic coatings as a matrix, adhesion peptides were bound to further increase the specificity of titanium implant surfaces. To enhance cell attachment in the gingiva region, a linear adhesion peptide developed from a laminin sequence (TWYKIAFQRNRK) was bound to collagen, whereas for the bone interface, a cyclic RGD peptide was bound to HAP and mineralized collagen using adequate anchor systems. The biological potential of these coatings deduced from cell attachment experiments with HaCaT human keratinocytes and MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts showed the best results for collagen and laminin sequence coating for the gingiva region and mineralized collagen and RGD peptide coatings for regions with bone contact. Our concept opens promising approaches to improve the biological integration of dental implants.

Complement activation is known to occur and induce unspecific inflammation around the biomaterials. Human vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu), two potent inhibitors of complement, can be bound by CoNS. With a hypothesis whether binding of Vn or Clu influences complement activation, two measurements were determined. For Vn, complement activation was measured with a mouse anti-activated human C9 antibody. In the presence of Vn-binding strain, Staphylococcus hemolyticus SM13I, complement activation on a surface pre-coated with Vn occurred as it did in the absence of Vn pre-coating. For S. epidermidis 3380, which does not express binding of Vn, complement activation on a Vn-presented surface was significantly decreased. For Clu, erythrocytes lysis was measured to reflect the end product of complement activation (membrane attack complex). The complement-induced hemolysis increased when human serum was pre-incubated with Clu-binding strains, S. epidermidis J9P. The enhancement of hemolysis by J9P decreased when serum was supplemented by exogenous Clu. The data imply that interaction between CoNS and Vn or Clu interferes with one of their physiological functions, complement inhibition.

To overcome these problems, we are developing a ""composite enterocystoplasty"" procedure to replace the epithelium of the bowel with autologous in vitro-propagated normal urothelial cells. The aims of this study were to evaluate synthetic biomaterials as delivery vehicles for the cultured urothelial cells and provide support during transfer and cell adherence to the de-epithelialized bowel wall. The surgical compliance of 12 biomaterials was evaluated, along with their ability to support urothelial cell attachment. Transfer of urothelial cells onto biomaterials as single cell suspensions or intact cell sheets was investigated. Seeding of a single cell suspension on to non-woven mesh resulted in poor cell attachment. Seeding onto woven mesh was more efficient, but the most effective transfer method involved producing an intact cell sheet that could be combined with woven, knitted and non-woven biomaterials. Transfer of the cell sheet : mesh complexes onto a de-epithelialized bladder stroma produced a stratified epithelium incorporating the strands of the mesh and expressing urothelial-associated antigens after 48 h in organ culture. Thus, we have developed and evaluated a suitable transfer method for in vitro propagated urothelial cells to be used in ""composite enterocystoplasty"".

However, the precise effects of therapeutic US on tissue healing processes are not clearly understood, although they are likely to involve changes in key cellular functions. The present study has therefore examined the effects of several US intensity levels on the activity of two bone-associated proteins, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteopontin (OP) in a human cell line, MG63, using RT-PCR. ALP showed progressively higher expression with increasing US intensities, whereas OP responded differently, showing down-regulation at 120 mW/cm(2), the lowest US exposure. OP expression was considerably less affected overall compared with the relative response of ALP to the same US doses. The results show that there is a differential response to therapeutic levels of US, since ALP and OP clearly exhibited gene-specific response profiles. These findings suggest that modifying the parameters of US exposure could be used to improve repair and regeneration processes and enhance the clinical efficacy of implanted biomaterials for tissue engineering.

The Cavendish Laboratory's Multiple Impact Jet Apparatus (MIJA) is able to simulate high velocity rain impact accurately and reproducibly under laboratory conditions using a series of discrete, carefully controlled water jets. Traditionally, quantitative erosion data in the form of Damage Threshold Velocity (DTV) curves are obtained, particularly for ceramic materials and glasses. These curves enable direct comparison of material strength, and can be sensitive enough to distinguish different preparation and polishing processes. However, current research into nanocomposites for the aerospace industry has prompted a reassessment of damage criteria. One of the emerging areas of interest in materials for aerospace applications is mimicking natural structures such as abalone nacre with a view to creating them synthetically for use in environmentally tough environments. This paper presents high speed liquid impact, and related data, on contrasting, natural structures - cross-lamellar and nacreous structures. The different mechanisms of high speed liquid impact will be described and how these mechanisms affect structure in different ways. Identifying potential failure mechanisms that are likely to be encountered under these conditions, and how to test for them will be of key importance as synthetic mimics will initially be expensive and probably small-scale.","Cavendish Lab, PCS, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Kennedy, CF (reprint author), Cavendish Lab, PCS, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,SCIENCE PRESS,MONMOUTH JUNCTION,"2031 US HIGHWAY 130 STE F, MONMOUTH JUNCTION, NJ 08852-3014 USA",,,1-880132-79-6,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,26,31,,,,,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Mechanics,BU28J,WOS:000175560700005,,,,,2019-02-25

These biocompatible porous titanium foams with a porosity of 80% and pore size between 200500 mum are expected to be used as biomaterial candidate for bone implants because its open-cellular structure permits the ingrowths of new-bone tissues and the transport of the body fluids.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Struct & Engn Mat, Kita Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4628510, Japan","Wen, CE (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Struct & Engn Mat, Kita Ku, 1-1 Hirate Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4628510, Japan.",,"Chino, Yasumasa/L-9782-2018","Chino, Yasumasa/0000-0002-0725-8237",,,,10,0,0,0,1,SCIENCE PRESS,MONMOUTH JUNCTION,"2031 US HIGHWAY 130 STE F, MONMOUTH JUNCTION, NJ 08852-3014 USA",,,1-880132-79-6,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,552,556,,,,,,5,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Mechanics,BU28J,WOS:000175560700129,,,,,2019-02-25

A 20-channel implant of the second generation type for mobilisation of paraplegics and an 8-channel implant of the third generation type for cardiac assist have been tested in animal studies. A device of completely new design for direct stimulation of denervated muscles is being tested in animal studies. There is a limited choice of technologically suitable biocompatible and bioresistant materials for implants. The physical design has to be anatomically shaped without corners or edges. Electrical conductors carrying direct current (D.C.) have to be placed inside a hermetic metal case. The established sealing materials, silicone rubber and epoxy resin, do not provide hermeticity and should only embed DC-free components. For electrical connections outside the hermetic metal case welding is preferable to soldering; conductive adhesives should be avoided. it is advisable to use a hydrophobic oxide ceramic core for telemetry antenna coils embedded in sealing polymer. Cleaning of all components before sealing in resin is of the utmost importance as well as avoidance of rapid temperature changes during the curing process. (C) 2001 IPEM.

Implants of ALCAP and HA were implanted into 10 adult male rats subcutaneously (S/C) and intraperitoneally (I/P). At 90 days post-implantation, the animals were euthanized, and the ceramic devices, the fibrous tissue, and vital organs were harvested. Evaluation of routine stained sections (5 mum, hematoxylin & eosin) of the fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the HA and ALCAP ceramics revealed the following: 1) all the ceramic devices had fibrous connective tissue capsules of slightly varying degrees of thickness at the time of sacrifice, depending on the site of implantation and type of material, and 2) there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the numbers and types of cellular components with respect to implantation site. The number of macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts, degree of vascularity, and thickness of the fibrous tissue matrix was found to be statistically different between the SIC implanted ceramic groups.

When blood comes into contact with these so-called biomaterials, an inappropriate inflammatory response, which can be life-threatening in some patients, may develop. The reason for this inappropriate activation of host defence mechanisms is not entirely clear, however a number of strategies have evolved over the years to minimize this unwanted sequelae of CPB. These strategies include surface coating of the materials of the circuit, using new materials thought to improve biocompatibility, and using a number of pharmacological interventions designed to suppress the inflammatory response. Recently, there has been some evidence which indicates that the plasticizer employed in the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing of the CPB circuit may play a part in the development of the inflammatory response. The work described in this paper tends to support this thesis. These studies showed that by washing the plasticizer from the surface of the PVC tubing, the biocompatibility, as reflected in the upregulation of CID11b on the surface of neutrophils, was enhanced. Furthermore, the use of non-plasticized substitutes for PVC had a similar effect. The benefit from removing the plasticizer was similar to that gained from surface coating with heparin, one of the conventional approaches to reducing the inflammatory response to CPB.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London W12 0NN, England","Gourlay, T (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, Hammersmith Hosp Campus,Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",,,,,,,31,22,24,0,2,"ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC",LONDON,"338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON NW1 3BH, ENGLAND",0267-6591,,,PERFUSION-UK,Perfusion-UK,,2001.0,16,5,,,,,381,390,,10.1177/026765910101600508,,,,10,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,471BB,WOS:000170906000007,11565893.0,,,,2019-02-25

Materials such as stainless-steel, titanium and vitalium alloys have been the used more frequently, particularly in maxillo-facial implants for head & neck oncological patients. When radiotherapy treatments are recommended, two factors must be taken into consideration, in the treatment protocol: beam attenuation and scattering in the prosthesis material. In most cases the target volume for irradiation is an heterogeneous medium with soft biological tissue and metallic biomaterial. Although some work has been done in this filed, the influence of the prostheses during the irradiation process is still an open question. The main goal of this study is to develop some experimental work in order to understand, and quantify the influence of attenuation of radiation beam and scattering effects, in the dose delivered to the target volume and surrounding tissues. From the experimental data analysis, conclusions about benefits and risks that arise during radiotherapy treatments in those conditions are drawn. The first part of this study involved the characterization of the implant composition, using nuclear techniques. Afterwards, dosimetric studies were performed in an acrylic phantom in order to evaluate the perturbation caused by the prosthesis in the dose distribution in the target tissues surrounding the implant.","Inst Portugues Oncol Francisco Gentil, Dept Radioterapia, Lisbon, Portugal; EST&ST, Escola Super Technol Saude, Lisbon, Portugal; Inst Tecnol & Nucl, Sacavem, Portugal",,,"Alves, Eduardo/K-2481-2013","Alves, Eduardo/0000-0003-0633-8937",,,,37,0,0,0,2,ISTITUTI EDITORIALI E POLGRAFICI INTERNAZIONALI,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",1120-1797,,,PHYS MEDICA,Phys.

The evolution of the material structure was followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The degradation solutions were monitored with anionic chromatography (HPAE-PAD), colorimetric methods, and Fourier transformed infra-red spectrophotomety (FT-IR) in order to quantify the amount of plasticisers and sugars. SEVA-C micrographs presented an increase in the surface porosity as a function of immersion time.

They are also critical in polymer-supported heterogeneous catalysis. This article reviews recent progress in experimental and simulation methods for generating, characterizing, and modeling polymer micro- and nano-particles in a number of polymer and polymer blend systems. A description of the use of gas atomization (of melts) and microdroplet (solution) approaches to generation and characterization of spherical polymer powders and microparticles represents their unique applications, giving the non-specialist reader a comprehensive overview. Using novel instrumentation developed for probing single fluorescent molecules in submicrometer droplets, it is demonstrated that polymer particles of nearly arbitrary size and composition can be made with uniform size dispersion. This interesting finding is ascribed to new dynamic behavior, which emerges when polymers are confined in a small droplet of solution the size of a molecule or molecular aggregates. Solvent evaporation takes place on a time scale short enough to frustrate phase separation, producing dry pure polymer or polymer blend microparticles that have tunable properties and that are homogeneous within molecular dimensions. In addition, it shows how a number of optical methodologies such as Fraunhofer diffraction can be used to probe polymer particles immobilized on two-dimensional substrates or levitated in space using a three-dimensional quadrupole (Paul) trap. Unlike conventional methods such as electron-beam microscopy, the optical diffraction methods provide a unique look inside a polymer particle in a measurement time scale of a few milliseconds, making it attractive to in-line production applications. In particular, it shows that it is possible to use computational neural networks, extensive classical trajectory calculations (i.e., classical molecular dynamics methods) in conjunction with experiments to gain deeper insights into the structure and properties of the polymer microparticles. Overall, it is possible to use the new understanding of phase separation to produce a number of useful, scientifically interesting homogeneous polymer blends from bulk-immiscible components in solution. Additionally, this new knowledge provides useful guidelines for future experimental studies and theory development of polymer and polymer blend micro- and nano-particles, which are not widely studied.","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem & Analyt Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Otaigbe, JU (reprint author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,"Suter, Ulrich/H-8900-2013; Sumpter, Bobby/C-9459-2013","Suter, Ulrich/0000-0001-7467-7346; Sumpter, Bobby/0000-0001-6341-0355",,,,239,20,20,3,58,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,,,2001.0,154,,,,,,1,86,,,,,,86,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,BS45B,WOS:000169892100001,,,,,2019-02-25

These results are in good agreement with those in titanium materials immersed in Hanks' solution.","Natl Inst Mat Sci, Biomat Res Team, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hanawa, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Mat Sci, Biomat Res Team, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"AOBA ARAMAKI, SENDAI, 980, JAPAN",,,4-88903-404-8,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,187,188,,,,,,2,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BV26R,WOS:000178391600046,,,,,2019-02-25

In this study, change in this GJIC function of cells contacting with various microspheres prepared from biomaterials was estimated using different methods. It was observed that microspheres pre-coated before test cell adhesion inhibited the function more than those added after cell adhesion. In addition, the inhibition levels were affected by amounts, diameter, composition and time period of interaction of microspheres as well as cell type used in the study. These findings suggest that not only the way for cells to recognize the microspheres but also characteristics of the microspheres are important factors affecting the GJIC function. Interaction of microspheres with osteoblasts resulted in inhibition of their differentiation, indicating microspheres are probable to disturb both cell differentiation and the GJIC function of the cells. These findings suggest the possibility that GJIC function can be used as an index that gives information of biocompatibility of many kinds of materials even in the forms of particles.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Nakaoka, R (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"AOBA ARAMAKI, SENDAI, 980, JAPAN",,,4-88903-404-8,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,189,191,,,,,,3,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BV26R,WOS:000178391600047,,,,,2019-02-25

The testing was conducted in air at room temperature under conditions of frequency, f, =10, stress rate, R, =0.1, and a normal clamping pressure of about 30MP, using dogbone-shaped specimens and bridge-type pads with flat feet. Fretting greatly reduces the fatigue life and strength for both alloys under the normal stress of 30MPa. The fretting-fatigue strengths of the alloys are dramatically lower than their plain-fatigue strength. Under the participation of the fretting, the fatigue strengths of Ti-6Al4V ELI and Ti-6Al-7Nb are reduced respectively to be 350 MPa and 300 MPa from 700 MPa and 650 MPa, and that of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr is decreased to be 150 MPa from 380 MPa. The fretting scar consists intrinsically of fretted delaminations. Relatively, the delaminated degree of the beta alloy is not as heavy as that of the alpha+beta alloys. The fretting-fatigue cracking of the two alpha+beta titanium alloys happen near the stick/slip boundary, where a tensile surface stress concentration exists due to the static traction blocking the deformation of this region, but the pure beta alloy cracks near the edge of the contact (EOC) where the amplitude of the micro slip and the traction are maximum and hence the worn degree is also believed to be maximum. In the alpha+beta alloys surface cracks concentrate at-edges of every delamination in the fretted areas, but in the beta alloy cracks are found mainly near the EOC. The angle of the crack propagation to the specimen surface and the fracture features of fretting fatigue are apparently different from those of plain fatigue for the alpha+beta titanium alloys, and the fretting-induced feature on the fracture pattern of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr is not remarkable. The dramatic reduction of the fatigue strength and life of the alpha+beta alloys and the beta alloy under fretting is explained.","Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Nagoya 4648650, Japan","Fukui, H (reprint author), Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Nagoya 4648650, Japan.",,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"AOBA ARAMAKI, SENDAI, 980, JAPAN",,,4-88903-404-8,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,205,208,,,,,,4,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BV26R,WOS:000178391600051,,,,,2019-02-25

Recently, a new 0 type titanium alloy, Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, composed of non-toxic elements was designed and developed for biomedical applications. Fretting fatigue failure is highly possible to occur for biomedical instruments in vivo. Under fretting fatigue conditions, fatigue crack tends to initiate much faster than that under plain fatigue conditions, and initiates, for example, at friction area between stem and bone cement in artificial hip joints. Fretting and plain fatigue characteristics of the new alloy were investigated with relating microstructure in comparison with those of conventional biomedical alpha+beta titanium alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb. Fretting and plain fatigue limits in air, sigma(wf) and sigma(wp), of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr conducted with solution treatment are around 200 MPa and 400 MPa, respectively. The ratio of fretting fatigue to plain fatigue limit, sigma(wf)/sigma(wp), of the new alloy is obviously greater than those of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb. The fretting fatigue strength of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr conducted with solution treatment in Ringer's solution is nearly equal to that in air in high cycle fatigue region because the frictional force decreases and fretting fatigue crack initiation is accelerated due to the formation of corrosion pits in Ringer's solution.","Toyohashi Univ Technol, Dept Prod Syst Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan","Akahori, T (reprint author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, Dept Prod Syst Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan.",,,,,,,6,3,3,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"AOBA ARAMAKI, SENDAI, 980, JAPAN",,,4-88903-404-8,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,209,212,,,,,,4,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BV26R,WOS:000178391600052,,,,,2019-02-25

After that the compact was immersed in aqueous solution of CaO. 2) The powders were mixed with CaO particles, and sintered by SPS. 3) The powders were immersed in aqueous solution of CaO. The powders with the surface modification were sintered by SPS. Because of adsorption of calcium phosphate on the surface of the calcium-modified particles, the compacts were immersed in Hanks' solution. The amount of precipitation of the calcium phosphate through the compacts was measured and compared with the difference between the sintering methods. The porous compact, which was composed of titanium powder particles covered with calcium phosphate, could adsorb large amount of proteins.

In order to treat this natural variability, statistical techniques need to be applied to model thermal process operations in foods and biological products. Stochastic approaches can be used to incorporate the probabilistic nature of the properties of food and biological products as well as thermal processes into the mathematical formulations. This work developed and implemented a stochastic perturbation-based finite element approach for thermal process operations and provided outputs in terms of meaningful statistics as mean temperature values and variances.

Higher temperature TSDC spectra (250 to 350 K) provided the alpha relaxation peaks associated with the glass transition temperature. The direct signal analysis (DSA) method allowed the decomposition of the complex peaks into elementary processes.

The changes observed in the low and high temperature polarization with the number of backbone methylene groups were interpreted as a combination of flexibility and entanglement phenomena.","Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Fis, Caracas, Venezuela; Univ London, Sch Pharm, London, England; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem, Piscataway, NJ USA","Suarez, N (reprint author), Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Fis, Caracas, Venezuela.",,,,,,,13,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK,, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-0150,,,RADIAT EFF DEFECT S,Radiat.

This ESR peak intensity in DAp with collagen (c-DAp) decreased in an increase in the amount of collagen added into Ca(H2PO4)(2)H2O (MCP) electrolytic solution, because dangling H+ of HPO42- binds to the carboxyl group of collagen due to the hydrogen bond. The ESR signal intensities at near g = 2 in DAp, c-DAp, and stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HAp) after X ray irradiation, were proportional to the absorbed dose in the range from 6 to 380 Gy. These ESR signal intensities decreased when the X ray-irradiated DAp, c-DAp, and HAp was suspended in the simulated body fluid. This fact suggests that the surface layer contained high density of ESR active species in DAp, c-DAp. and HAp dissolved in the simulated body fluid. Therefore, with thr dosemeter utilising such biomaterials as tooth and bone, sufficient care must be paid to the effect of body fluid.","Niigata Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, Niigata 9502181, Japan; Niigata Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Niigata 9502181, Japan","Ohta, M (reprint author), Niigata Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, 8050 Ikarashi 2 No Cho, Niigata 9502181, Japan.",,,,,,,10,6,6,0,1,NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY PUBL,ASHFORD,"PO BOX 7, ASHFORD TN23 1YW, KENT, ENGLAND",0144-8420,,,RADIAT PROT DOSIM,Radiat.

The fretting-fatigue limits of the alloys are dramatically lower than their plain-fatigue limits. The contact areas are fretted heavily, and every scar consists of a stick region in the middle and two slip regions beside. Lots of surface cracks exist in the fretted areas. The dramatic reduction of fatigue life is ascribed to the increased stress intensity factor of the crack in early stage due to the cooperative action of alternating bulk stress, frictional force and normal stress under fretting condition. The fracture features and the angle of the crack propagation to the specimen surface of fretting fatigue are different from those of plain fatigue.","Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648650, Japan","Fukui, H (reprint author), Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Chikusa Ku, 1-100 Kusumoto Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648650, Japan.",,,,,,,11,1,1,0,5,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-487-9,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,107,114,,,,,,8,"Materials Science, Biomaterials",Materials Science,BS16A,WOS:000168874700012,,,,,2019-02-25

The austenitic structure of this alloy is maintained by a high nitrogen content of approximately one percent. Besides austenitic stability, the high nitrogen content also contributes to high levels of corrosion resistance and strength. The corrosion resistance and strength properties of BioDur 108 Alloy are compared to several nickel-containing austenitic stainless alloys that have been used as biomaterials. The strength of such alloys tends to be dominated by nitrogen content, while corrosion resistance is strongly related to the combined contents of chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen. However, the quantitative effect of nitrogen variations on the corrosion resistance observed in high nitrogen alloys is significantly different than in alloys with lower nitrogen levels. In addition, the high manganese content of high nitrogen alloys affects the corrosion characteristics in certain tests, in particular the passive current density measured during potentiodynamic corrosion testing at rapid scan rates. However, it was found that the passive current densities of high nitrogen high manganese alloys quickly decay to the levels of the comparative alloys in potentiostatic current decay tests and in potentiodynamic tests at slower scan rates.","Carpenter Technol Corp, Reading, PA USA","Gebeau, RC (reprint author), Carpenter Technol Corp, Reading, PA USA.",,,,,,,15,1,2,1,1,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-487-9,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,157,164,,,,,,8,"Materials Science, Biomaterials",Materials Science,BS16A,WOS:000168874700018,,,,,2019-02-25

Within the body, gas-solid interactions become relatively less significant and solid-liquid or solid-solid interfaces dominate, providing new challenges for the surface scientist. The current paper aims to provide a timely review of the use of surface analysis and modification techniques within the biomaterials field. A broad overview of applications in a number of related areas is given with particular attention focusing on those materials commonly encountered in dentistry and oral or maxillofacial implantology. Several specific issues of current interest are discussed. The interaction between synthetic and natural solids, both in the oral environment and elsewhere in the body is important in terms of adhesion, related stresses and strains and ultimately the longevity of a dental restoration, biomedical implant, or indeed the surrounding tissue. Exposure to body fluids, of course, can also affect stability, leading to the degradation or corrosion of materials within the body. Whilst this could potentially be harmful, e.g., if cytotoxic elements are released, it may alternatively provide a route to the preferential release of beneficial substances. Furthermore, in some cases, the controlled disintegration of a biomaterial is desirable, allowing the removal of an implant, e.g., without the need for further surgery, The presence of cells in the immediate bioenvironment additionally complicates the situation. A considerable amount of current research activity is targeted at the development of coatings or surface treatments to encourage tissue growth. Lf this is to be achieved by stimulating enhanced cell productivity, determination of the relationship between cell function and surface composition is essential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cells cultured at 37 degreesC are harvested from the surfaces only by reducing temperature without trypsin due to the surface property change from relatively hydrophobic to hydrophilic, depending on temperature. Confluent cells are harvested as a single contiguous cell sheet. The harvested cell sheets are subjected to several applications such as cell sheet transplantation for capillary network formation and piling for the reconstruction of three-dimensional tissue architectures. By patterned grafting of smart polymers onto culture dish surfaces, novel patterned cell coculture was also achieved, which can be utilized for extracorporeal devices.

Although a periodontal connective tissue attachment offers distinct advantages, only osseointegration and fibro-osseous integration are at present clinically achievable. Recent studies indicate a periodontal regeneration-competent cell population and an appropriate biomaterial substrate both are required for periodontal connective attachment formation on biomaterial surfaces. We therefore have developed an in vitro model to characterize the effects of various biomaterial substrates on the early events of periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. Primary cultures of periodontal ligament and gingival connective tissue cells were cultured on uncoated (control) and coated (titanium- and hydroxyapatite-coated) tissue culture plastic, and the level of cell proliferation, collagen, and noncollagen protein synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity, and expression of a 42 kD cementum extracellular matrix protein were measured over 5, 7, and 9 days in culture. While all three substrates supported cell attachment, proliferation, and protein synthesis, only uncoated and titanium-coated tissue culture plastic supported expression of the cementum extracellular matrix protein after 9 days of culture. In addition, the levels of cell proliferation and collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis for cells grown on hydroxyapatite-coated surfaces lagged behind cells cultured on the control or titanium-coated surfaces at each of the three time points. These data suggest that biomaterial substrates markedly can influence the temporal sequence of extracellular matrix proteins associated with periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. In addition to surface composition (titanium versus hydroxyapatite), surface properties (e.g., topography) also may have an effect on periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. This model may be of use in designing biomaterials to support the formation of periodontal connective tissue attachment in vivo.

The experiments on the different samples are carried out using the same thermal history throughout the entire characterization process. The high-temperature current rise caused by the conductivity of the samples is studied with a simple model that utilizes an approximation of the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) relaxation time. The conductivity data is well reproduced except for temperatures well below the glass-transition temperature and for small currents. The glass-transition peak is modeled with a phenomenological expression valid near T-g, which is able to describe the glass relaxation with a minimum number of parameters. The conduction and the glass-transition relaxation are studied versus the structural changes for the different samples. It is found that the conductivity and the glass-transition temperature shift to lower temperatures as the methylene groups in the backbone increase. Furthermore, if the experimental data is presented as a function of the reduced temperature, the shape of the glass-transition relaxation for the different samples is independent of the polymer backbone length.

Optical characterization indicates a successful retention of protein conformation after encapsulation. The conformation retention is strongly correlated to both the rate of gelation and the subsequent drying speed. Using hemoglobin as a model protein, a higher colloidal solid concentration and a lower synthesis pH were found, both causing faster gelation, resulting in a better retention of conformation. Hemoglobin encapsulated in a thin film, which dries faster, also showed a better retention than in the bulk. This is attributed to the fact that when a protein is isolated, and especially when it is confined to a space close to its own dimensions, conformational changes are sterically hindered, hence the structural stability. Enzymatic activity of bovine liver catalase was also monitored and showed a remarkable improvement when encapsulated using the aqueous colloidal process, compared to using the conventional alkoxide-based process. Thus, the aqueous colloidal sol-gel process offers a promising alternative to the conventional sol-gel process for encapsulating biomolecules into transparent, porous matrices.

To design a biomedically useful polymer that is intrinsically infection-resistant, we have developed a ciprofloxacin-loaded polyurethane (PU) matrix that releases antibiotic locally at the implant surface, thereby minimizing bacterial accumulation. We report here the methods of fabrication and formulation for making such antibiotic-loaded devices, as well as evidence of their bactericidal properties. Specifically, various pore-forming agents and drug loadings were examined. An optimum formulation consisting of BIOSPAN(R) PU, poly(ethylene glycol) and ciprofloxacin offered the longest effective period of sustained release (5 days). The bactericidal efficacy of the released ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was four times that of the control PU without antibiotics. This bactericidal efficiency was due to an increase in the PA detachment from the surface. These observations suggested that the released ciprofloxacin was biologically active in preventing the bacteria from permanently adhering to the substratum, and thus decreasing the possibility of biofilm-related infection.

It is generally reported that the cytotoxicity of a chemical differs with cell lines. However, our previous study revealed a high correlation in the cytotoxicity of 43 metal salts between two murine cell Lines. If there is any generic tendency toward metal salt cytotoxicity for many kinds of cells, that information is helpful for the determination of the chemical composition of new metallic biomaterials that are expected to have lower cytotoxicity. In this study, the cytotoxicity of 12 metal salts was evaluated using four cell lines, and the results were compared, including those for two other cell lines obtained in our previous study. A metal salt concentration that reduced cell viability to 50% of that without any metal salt (IC50) was used as an index to compare the metal salt cytotoxicity between cell lines. The correlation was statistically proved by the IC(50)s of 12 metal salts among these cell Lines (p < 0.01), suggesting the existence of a generic tendency to metal salt cytotoxicity beyond cell lines. The metal salt order of toxicity from the highest was K2Cr2O7, AgNO3 VCl3, SbCl3,CuCl2,CoCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2,Cr(NO3)(3), FeCl3, TiCl4, and Al(NO3)(3).

Thus, lesions of this tissue are a pro-arthrotic factor, and up to now the conservative treatment of cartilage lesions and arthrosis does not yield satisfying results. Therefore, autologous transplantation of articular chondrocytes is being investigated in a variety of different assays. The aim of our study was to create a mechanically stable cell-matrix implant with viable and active chondrocytes which could serve to fill out articular lesions created in the knees of sheep. For this purpose, articular cartilage was collected from knee lesions, chondrocytes were liberated enzymatically and seeded in culture flasks and cultured till confluency. Cells were then trypsinized and grown on a type I/III collagen matrix (Chondro-Gide(TM) Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhusen, Switzerland) for 3, 6 and 10 days before being fixed and embedded for electron microscopy by routine methods. Scanning electron microscopy was performed after dehydration in acetone, critical point drying and sputter-coating with gold-paladium, Light microscopically, clusters of chondrocytes can be seen on the surface of the matrix with a few cells growing into the matrix. Transmission electron microscopic photographs yield a rather differentiated chondrocyte-like appearance, which is evidence of a matrix-induced redifferentiation after dedifferentiation during the growth period in the culture flasks. Scanning electron microscopic results show large, flattened chondrocytes without signs of differentiation on plastic, whereas chondrocytes grown on the Chondro-Gide(TM) sponge show a more roundish aspect wrapping firmly around the collagen fibrils, exhibiting numerous contacts with the matrix. This cell-matrix biocomposite can now serve to fill out articular cartilage lesions created in the knees of sheep.","Univ Lubeck, Inst Anat, Orthopad Klin, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; Univ Lubeck, Inst Med Mol Biol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany","Ehlers, EM (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, Inst Anat, Orthopad Klin, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.",,,,,,,9,49,49,0,3,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX NO.100 537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",0940-9602,,,ANN ANAT,Ann.

Despite widespread use of potent antibiotics, infections of artificial implants and catheters are of increasing concern. We tested whether local treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), long known as an inexpensive wound disinfectant, could prevent or reduce bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials. Methods. Two-centimeter-long pieces of polyurethane and silicone tubing were contaminated with a standardized solution of Staphylococcus epidermidis (10(5)/mL) and then rinsed and wiped with saline (0.9%) solution. Bacterial growth was assessed after incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Bacterial colonies were compared for the following treatments: wiping only with saline; wiping with 1.5%, 2%, or 3% H2O2; pretreating biomaterials with 3% H2O2 and subsequent contamination for 2 and 4 hours without treatment after contamination; and contamination of tubings I month after pretreatment with 30% H2O2. The effect of 3% H2O2 was also assessed on contamination with Escherichia coli. Results. Bacterial growth was reduced by more than 99% when the contaminated tubes were treated with 3% H2O2 compared with saline control (p < 0.001). Lower concentrations of H2O2 were less effective. The length of the contamination period had no influence on the effectiveness of H2O2 when used on polyurethane but did with silicone tubings. Pretreatment with H2O2 1 month before contamination still reduced bacterial growth rate by 90% on polyurethane and by 75% on silicone tubings. Comparable effects on bacterial growth rate were observed for staphylococci (-90%, p < 0.001) and escherichiae (-90%, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Local treatment with 3% H2O2 significantly reduced bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials even for I month after treatment. This finding might influence clinical strategies of prevention of foreign body infection.

Identically sized pins, prepared from poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), poly(DTH carbonate), and poly(DTO carbonate) were implanted transcortically in the proximal tibia and the distal femur of skeletally mature New Zealand White Rabbits. The tissue response at the bone-implant interface was characterized in terms of the absence of a fibrous capsule (direct bone apposition, indicative of a bone bonding response) or the presence of a fibrous capsule (referred to as the encapsulation response). The relative frequency of direct bone apposition versus encapsulation was recorded for each polymer throughout the entire period of the study. While all four polymers were tissue compatible, there was a correlation between the chemical structure of the pendent chain and the type of bone response observed, with poly(DTE carbonate) having the highest tendency to elicit direct bone apposition. Based on in vivo degradation data and the ability of moder polymers with carboxylate groups at their surface to chelate calcium ions, it is proposed that the ability of poly(DTE carbonate) to bond to bone is caused by the facile hydrolysis of the pendent ethyl eater groups which creates calcium ion chelation sites on the polymer surface. The incorporation of calcium chelation sites into the chemical structure of an implant material appears to be a key requirement if direct bone apposition/bone bonding is desired. This study demonstrates that very subtle changes in the chemical composition of an implant material can have significant effects on the long-term tissue response in a clinically relevant model.

In this paper, several in vitro and in vivo techniques from previously published results and current investigations are highlighted and presented to demonstrate means of delineating a part of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between biomaterials and macrophages. Complement component C3 was found critical in mediating the initial adhesion of human macrophages on medical-grade polyetherurethaneureas. From radioimmunoassay studies, the presence of a diphenolic antioxidant additive in polyetherurethaneureas increased the propensity for complement upregulation but did not affect adherent macrophage density. The subcutaneous cage-implant system was utilized to confirm the role of interleukin-4 in the fusion of adherent macrophages to form foreign body giant cells on polyurethanes in vivo. To probe the function-structural relationship of macrophage-active proteins, fibronectin was employed as a model in the formulation of synthetic oligopeptide mimetics. Peptides were grafted onto previously developed, non-cell adhesive polyethyleneglycol-based networks. The results indicate that grafted tripeptide RGD sequence supported higher adherent macrophage density than surfaces grafted with other peptides such as PHSRN and PRRAPV sequences. However, the formation of foreign body giant cells on peptide-grafted networks was highly dependent on the relative orientation between PHSRN and RGD sequences located in a single peptide.

The mechanisms by which a physiologic matrix interface on such polymers may regulate and promote cell migration under 'activated conditions' were the focus of this study. We have quantified the migration behavior of epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated epidermal keratinocytes on 50: 50 poly-D,L(lactide-glycolide) (PLGA) substrates, following exogenous and cell-derived substrate conditioning based on the model matrix proteins, collagen and fibronectin. We report that 'non-conditioned' PLGA substrates elicited poor levels of keratinocyte migration. However, keratinocyte migration was significantly enhanced upon the adsorption of type I collagen, and was only weakly enhanced with fibronectin adsorption. Molecular analysis of the mechanism of enhanced migration on collagen-PLGA substrates showed that keratinocyte migration was sensitive to cell-derived fibronectin conditioning, but not to cell-secreted collagen conditioning. Fibronectin control of cell migration on collagen-PLGA was found to be both stoichiometric and biologically specific, mediated via adhesion involving keratinocyte alpha v integrin receptors. Based on our results, we propose a unique paradigm for induction of cell migration on a non-physiologic synthetic polymer using concerted interactions between primary, polymer-instructed matrix remodeling and secondary, cell-derived matrix remodeling.

We report here a comparison of the migratory and adhesion behavior of Jurkat cells (a T lymphoblastoid cell line) on tissue culture treated and untreated polystyrene surfaces coated with Various concentrations of fibronectin. The average speed of cell locomotion showed a biphasic response to substrate adhesiveness for cells migrating on untreated polystyrene and a monotonic decrease for cells migrating on tissue culture-treated polystyrene. A modified approach to the persistent random walk model was implemented to determine the time dependence of cell migration parameters. The random motility coefficient showed significant increases with time when cells migrated on tissue culture-treated polystyrene surfaces, while it remained relatively constant for experiments with untreated polystyrene plates. Finally, a cell migration computer model was developed to verify our modified persistent random walk analysis. Simulation results suggest that our experimental data were consistent with temporally increasing random motility coefficients. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two-dimensional surfaces of poly(glycolide) (PGA), poly(L-lactide) (L-PLA), poly(D,L-lactide) (D,L-PLA), 85:15 poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (D,L-PLGA), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), 90:10 (D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (D,L-PLCL), 9:91 D,L-PLCL, 40:60 L-PLCL, 67:33 poly(glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PGTMC), and poly(dioxanone) (PDO) were made by spin-casting into uniform thin films. Adhesion kinetics were studied using TCPs and PCL films and revealed that the rate of chondrocyte adhesion began to level off after 6 h. Degree of HAC chondrocyte adhesion was studied on all the substrates after 8 h, and ranged from 47 to 145% of the attachment found on TCPS. The greatest number of chondrocytes attached to PGA and 67:33 PGTMC polymer films, and attachment to PCL and L-PLA films was statistically lower than that found on PGA (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between amount of chondrocyte attachment to the substrates and the substrates' water contact angle. Chondrocytes proliferated equally well on all the substrates resulting in equivalent cell numbers on all the substrates at both day 4 and day 7 of the culture. However, these total cell numbers were reached as a result of a 88- and 42-fold expansion on PDO and PLA, respectively, which was significantly higher than the Ii-fold expansion found on TCPS (p < 0.05). The greater fold expansion of the cells on PDO and L-PLA films may be attributed to the availability of space for cells to grow, since their numbers at the start of culture were fewer following the 8 h attachment period. This suggests that regardless of initial seeding density on these degradable polymer substrates (i.e., if some minimum number of cells are able to attach), they will eventually populate the surfaces of all these polymers given sufficient space and time.

Exposure of HMECs to either soluble collagen Type IV or soluble fibronectin prior to exposure of these cells to hydrated SIS showed only partial inhibition of HMEC attachment. We conclude that HMECs find hydrated SIS to be a suitable substrate for adherence and that dehydration of SIS adversely affects the ability of HMECs to adhere in vitro. The cause of HMEC adherence to SIS appears to be a combination of both its composition and architecture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition to acceleration of normal wound healing phenomena, endosseous implants should result in formation of a characteristic interfacial layer and bone matrix with adequate biomechanical properties. To achieve these goals, however, a better understanding of events at the interface and of the effects biomaterials have on bone and bone cells is needed. Such knowledge is essential for developing strategies to optimally control osseointegration. This paper reviews current knowledge of the bone-biomaterial interface and methods being investigated for controlling it. Morphological studies have revealed the heterogeneity of the bone-implant interface. One feature often reported, regardless of implant material, is an afibrillar interfacial zone, comparable to cement lines and laminae limitantes at natural bone interfaces. These electron-dense interfacial layers are rich in noncollagenous proteins, such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Several approaches, involving alteration of surface physicochemical, morphological, and/or biochemical properties, are being investigated in an effort to obtain a desirable bone-implant interface. Of particular interest are biochemical methods of surface modification, which immobilize molecules on biomaterials for the purpose of inducing specific cell and tissue responses or, in other words, to control the tissue-implant interface with biomolecules delivered directly to the interface. Although still in its infancy, early studies indicate the value of this methodology for controlling cell and matrix events at the bone-implant interface. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many cells on adhesive molecules will spread and form an organized actin cytoskeleton and complex transmembrane signaling regions called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions appear to function as both signaling and stabilizing components of normal adherent cell activity. To better understand adhesion formations between cells and their underlying substrata, we have designed, developed, and utilized a novel 'cytodetachment' methodology to quantify the force required to displace attached cells. We allowed bovine articular chondrocytes to attach and spread on a substratum of either fibronectin, bovine serum albumin, or standard microscope glass. The cytodetacher was then employed to displace the cells from the substratum. Our results demonstrate that a significantly greater force is required to detach cells from fibronectin versus the two other substrata, suggesting that a cell's actin cytoskeleton and perhaps focal adhesions contribute significantly to its mechanical adhesiveness. The cytodetacher allows us to directly measure the force required for cell detachment from a substratum and to indirectly determine the ability of different substrata to support cell adhesion.

Activation of the intracellular small molecular weight GTPase, RhoA, has recently been shown to play an essential role in controlling initiation of key integrin-mediated events in surface adhesion and proliferation. RhoA is interconvertible between an active, membrane-bound form and an inactive, cytosolic RhoGDI-bound form in response to integrin stimulation. This study reports the use of self-assembled functionalized organic alkylthiol monolayers (SAMs) as well-defined cell culture substrates to investigate the relationships between surface chemistry, RhoA activation and subsequent cell morphological and molecular level signal transduction responses in cells attaching to derivatized SAMs. Well-controlled alkylthiol surface chemistries were used to monitor and modulate the activation state of RhoA in attaching cells. Activation states were determined indirectly by fractionating cell lysates into membrane and cytosolic fractions by ultracentrifugation. Western blots were then performed, showing RhoA localization to be surface chemistry-dependent. RhoGDI levels and its intracellular localization were also shown to be surface-chemistry dependent. Cells cultured on -CH3, terminated SAMs, which normally exhibit a low-growth phenotype, were transfected with a constitutively active mutant form of RhoA. Subsequent cell morphological changes were observed on SAM surfaces by fluorescence microscopy. Results support surface chemistry influences on the activation state of RhoA mediated by adsorbed proteins and distinct changes in adherent cell morphology resulting from modulation of this activation state.

Of particular importance is the smoothness of the surface and good adhesion of the coatings to the substrate. We have investigated carbon films which were synthesized by Radio Frequency Plasma Chemical Vapour Deposition (RF-PCVD). The specimens obtained have been rested to show their structure and their biological, mechanical and chemical resistance.

Upon gradual heating the enzyme in solution precipitates at 64 degrees C, whereas the encapsulated enzyme does not; it unfolds, with the nominal melting temperature of 51 +/- 3 degrees C. Even at 74.0 degrees C, the encapsulated enzyme is only similar to 77% unfolded, but it does not refold upon cooling. Upon treatment with guanidinium chloride, the degree of enzyme unfolding is 100% in solution but only similar to 83% within the silica matrix. Again, the enzyme does not refold upon removal of the denaturing agent from the glass. The glass matrix constrains the motions of the encapsulated protein molecules and prevents both their full unfolding and refolding. The former may be taken for ""stabilization"", the later for ""destabilization"" of the native conformation. Evidently, the effect of the glass on the encapsulated protein cannot be described in these general terms. The encapsulated enzyme obeys the Michaelis-Menten kinetic law as it catalyzes hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. The apparent Michaelis constant (K'(M)) is practically the same in the glass and in solution, but the apparent turnover number (k'(cat)) and specific activity for the encapsulated enzyme are only 1-2% of these values for the enzyme in solution. Because the substrate diffuses slowly into silica pores, most of the catalysis is due to the enzyme embedded near the surfaces of the glass monolith. Effect of encapsulation on structure and activity of proteins should be studied in quantitative detail before protein-doped glasses can be used as reliable biosensors, heterogeneous catalysts, and composite biomaterials.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50010 USA","Kostic, NM (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",,"Badjic, Jovica/H-9134-2013",,,,,42,81,81,0,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Ten specimens of each type (open and closed) of the three brands of elastic chains were included in the study (total of 60). All specimens were subjected to (a) optical transmission microscopy utilizing phase contrast and polarized light modes, (b) micro MIR FT-IR spectroscopy, and (c) scanning electron microscopy and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. Stretched elastomers demonstrated a honeycomb pattern of filament detachment corresponding to strained areas. The chains possessing a well-differentiated inter-modular link presented higher strain concentration gradients located in the link. Phase contrast imaging revealed that the stress adsorption mechanism of these materials involved macromolecular chain orientation and elongation co-axially to the applied load. The specimens retrieved after 24 hours had acquired a proteinaceous film rich in alcohol groups with minimal evidence of phosphate mineralization, while the 3-week retrieved specimens presented precipitation of Ca- and P-forming calcium phosphates. The high protein content of the biofilm organized on the surface of these materials, as well as the calcification pattern found, were similar to a non-specific mechanism of film adsorption of biomaterials exposed to body fluids. The results have clinical implications for aspects of retraction control through sliding mechanics with the use of elastomeric ligatures, and the potential detrimental effects on dental and periodontal tissues such as decalcification and gingival inflammation, respectively. In addition, the experimental protocols adopted for the in vitro study of the force decay of elastomerics should be modified to include parameters pertinent to adsorption phenomena and calcification processes documented to occur in vivo.","Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester M15 6FH, Lancs, England; Res Ctr Biomat, Athens, Greece","Watts, DC (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester M15 6FH, Lancs, England.",,"Eliades, Theodore/E-4959-2017","Eliades, Theodore/0000-0003-2313-4979; Watts, David/0000-0002-9105-2775",,,,22,51,56,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0141-5387,1460-2210,,EUR J ORTHODONT,Eur.

In practice, engineering strains are often used to calculate Poisson's ratio in place of the mathematically correct true strains with only very small differences resulting in the case of many engineering materials. The engineering strain definition is often used even in the inelastic region, for example, in metals during plastic yielding. However, for highly nonlinear elastic materials, such as many biomaterials, smart materials and microstructured materials, this convenient extension may be misleading, and it becomes advantageous to define a strain-varying Poisson's function. This is analogous to the use of a tangent modulus for stiffness. An important recent application of such a Poisson's function is that of auxetic materials that demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio and are often highly strain dependent. In this paper, the importance of the use of a Poisson's function in appropriate circumstances is demonstrated.

The use of the monomer 2,5-diiodo-8-quinolyl methacrylate (IHQM), which shows adequate polymerization and radio-opacity properties, is proposed as a new X-ray opaque, methacrylate iodine-containing agent. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of this new radio-opaque agent on the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cements. The addition of the iodine-containing methacrylate provides a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength, fracture toughness and ductility, with respect to the barium sulphate-containing cement. This effect can be attributed to the fact that the use of a radio-opaque monomer eliminates the porosity associated with the barium sulfate particles, which show no adhesion to the matrix. However, some reinforcing effect must also be attributed to the iodine-containing monomer, since the tensile and fracture toughness values reached are even higher than those shown by the radiolucent cement.

Initial adhesion was measured using phosphate-buffered saline and subsequent surface growth of the adhering bacteria using nutrient broth as growth medium. Initial adhesion was twice as fast on the positively charged methacrylate than on the negatively charged copolymer. Surface growth, however, was absent on the positively charged copolymer, while on the negatively charged methacrylate the number of bacteria increased exponentially during surface growth with a generation time of 32 min.

Consequently, they may find a range of applications in the biomaterials field. This work evaluated the influence of HA fillers and of blowing agents (used to produce porous architectures) over the viscoelastic properties of SEVA-C polymers, as seen by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), in order to speculate on their performances when withstanding cyclic loading in the body. The composite materials presented a promising performance under dynamic mechanical solicitation conditions. Two relaxations were found being attributed to the starch and EVOH phases. The EVOH relaxation process may be very useful in vivo improving the implants performance under cyclic loading. DMA results also showed that it is possible to produce SEVA-C compact surface/porous core architectures with a mechanical performance similar to that of SEVA-C dense materials. This may allow for the use of these materials as bone replacements or scaffolds that must withstand loads when implanted.

A major problem in the measurement of protein adsorption kinetics in such systems is that the protein has to diffuse through a boundary layer to reach the surface. The thickness of such a boundary layer can be reduced by shearing the fluid phase. In the classical TIRF adsorption chamber only a unidirectional flow of buffer through the chamber is possible. In such a chamber the shear rates and shear stresses vary across the cross section and only low shear rates are obtainable. Therefore based on a rheological system for studying fluid shear stress on cultured cells a TIRF-chamber was constructed which allowed the installment of a rotating cone (max. rate: 1200 rpm) and plate viscometer-type variable shear device. In this case a flow field can be set up in which the shear rates and shear stresses are approximately constant. Cone angles (alpha) between 1.0-2.5 degrees allowed shear rates (gamma) between 0 and 7200 s(-1). The TIRF-rheometer can be employed in two different modes in the form of: (a) a closed system (no fluid flow through the rheometer chamber), (b) an open system with continuous buffer flow through the chamber. The flow conditions were checked by observing the dissolution of a small spot of dried Coomassie blue as a function of the shear rate and time. A significant secondary flow was found with all cone angles and was dependent on the square root of the shear rate. Ink injection studies demonstrate that mixing times in the chamber below two seconds are obtainable. The TIRF Rheometer thus provides a means for studying the shear dependence of the adsorption of blood proteins and the generation of thin to ultra thin boundary layers for the measurement of protein adsorption kinetics relevant to biomaterials.","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol Chem, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Munster, Inst Physiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Jennissen, HP (reprint author), Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol Chem, Hufelandstr 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,44,9,9,0,1,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Treatment options for full thickness cartilage defects are discussed in this paper. Poor biomechanical characteristics of the reparative fibrocartilage promoted by ""traditional resurfacing techniques"" provide only moderate clinical outcome in the treatment of such lesions. During the last decade several new efforts have been expressed to provide a hyaline or hyaline-like gliding surface for a full thickness defected area on the weight bearing surface. Among several surgical procedures, autologous osteochondral transplantation methods, including osteochondral mosaicplasty, chondrocyte transplantation, periosteal and perichondrial resurfacement and allograft transplantation are the favoured ""new methods"". Experimental background, operative techniques and clinical results of these new procedures are detailed in this overview. According to the early and medium term experiences of these methods it seems that a hyaline or hyaline-like resurfacement of the defected area can provide a more durable gliding surface and a better clinical outcome than the so called ""traditional resurfacing techniques"". Autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty - as an easy, one-step procedure, providing a relatively quick rehabilitation - can be an alternative in the treatment of small and medium sized lesions. Excellent clinical outcome, low costs of the treatment and short rehabilitation time represent the main advantages of this method. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be a promising option in the treatment of larger full thickness defects but requires relatively expensive two-step procedure and longer rehabilitation period. Both of the above mentioned techniques have femoral, tibial, patellofemoral and talar applications as well. According to the present recommendations transplantation of osteochondral allografts can be indicated at massive osteochondral lesions. There are less experiences with the clinical use of periosteal and perichondrial resurfacing techniques and biomaterials. Beside the promising early and medium term results of these methods the authors express that a successful treatment of the full-thickness cartilage damages of the weight bearing surfaces depends not only the way of the cartilage repair but on the treatment of the underlying cause as well. According to this statement for an effective treatment of full thickness defects on the weight bearing surfaces requires careful patient selection, complex operative plan and well organized treatment course.","Hop Uzsoki, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary","Hangody, L (reprint author), Hop Uzsoki, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Mexikoi Str 62, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary.",hangody@mail.matavnet.hu,,,,,,57,17,18,0,5,MASSON EDITEUR,MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9,"21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

High levels of soluble triple helical homotrimeric [(alpha 1)(3)] type I procollagen were detected (up to 8 mg/ml) exclusively in the milk of six out of 9 lines of lactating transgenic mice. The transgene-derived human procollagen chains underwent efficient assembly into a triple helical structure. Although proline or lysine hydroxylation has never been described for any milk protein, procollagen was detected with these post-translational modifications. The procollagen was stable in mil; minimal degradation was observed.

Therefore, preclinical data should include materials science and engineering, biology, biochemistry, medicine, host reactions and their evaluation, the resting of biomaterials, and the degradation of materials in a biological environment.","Yonsei Univ, Dept Med Engn, Coll Med, Seoul 120752, South Korea","Suh, H (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Med Engn, Coll Med, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",,,,,,,25,4,5,0,1,YONSEI UNIV COLLEGE MEDICINE,SEOUL,"C/O KYUN0-IL IM, M.D., PH.D, SHINCHON DONG 134, SEODAEMOON KU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

It is experimentally proved that a liquid-liquid phase separation is responsible for this peculiar behaviour. Based on transmission electron microscopy observations of glasses and glass-ceramics, a novel growth mechanism is proposed for cabbage-shaped mica crystal aggregates in machinable mica glass-ceramics. In this model, crystallization takes place along isocompositional lines at or not far from the surface of the liquid-liquid phase separation droplets. Due to high growth rates, diffusion has only little impact on the crystal growth. Finally, experimental reasons for earlier misinterpretations are discussed. (C) 1999 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

Ingrowth and organization of fibrovascular tissue inside polymer scaffolds lead to the occlusion of the regenerated blood vessel. In order to provide regulatory mechanisms to control the development of an inner capsule, endothelialization of these materials is necessary. To achieve this, we employed a novel ammonia plasma technique to surface modified PLLA substrates. Human endothelial cell (HUVEC) and rabbit microvascular endothelial cell (RbMVEC) growth was studied on modified PLLA and control PLLA. Our studies show that modified PLLA and fibronectin (Fn)-coated modified PLLA exhibited statistically significant improvement in HUVEC and RbMVEC growth (P < 0.001) when compared to PLLA and Fn-coated PLLA. Therefore, ammonia plasma treatment gives us the unique capability of modifying prosthetic biomaterials of various constructs with the eventual transplantation of mammalian cells to be used in tissue engineering or as biological implants.

However, if the ligand molecule(s) are grafted on to an insoluble matrix the resulting ligand(s)-containing product becomes useful for separations applications related to metal recovery or remediation. It was discovered that biomolecules containing a primary amino group, secondary amino group, or hydroxyl group could be grafted into a polyurethane polymeric network via in situ polymerization reactions. With carboxyl groups, grafted material showed goon selectivity among a group of divalent metal cations, and a uranium-binding capacity of more than 10 mg/g of polymer. The material can be regenerated by sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate solution and reused. Data from a stirred-tank reactor showed fast uranium-binding kinetics, and breakthrough-elution studies with a packed-column reactor indicated promising process behavior.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Reeves, M (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",,,"Hu, Michael/0000-0001-8461-9684",,,,62,9,9,1,12,AMER INST CHEMICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0001-1541,,,AICHE J,AICHE J.,NOV,1999.0,45,11,,,,,2333,2345,,10.1002/aic.690451109,,,,13,"Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,254PD,WOS:000083620600008,,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of incorporation of this monomer to the self-curing resins, on the curing parameters, swelling behaviour and mechanical properties was studied. The incorporation of the radiopaque compound 2,5-diiodo-8-hydroxyquinoline to the solid phase was also carried out for comparative experiments. A decrease in the peak temperature and an increase in the setting time was observed with the addition of the radiopaque monomer, however, the curing parameters did not appreciably change with the addition of the radiopaque compound to the solid phase. Swelling of the modified cements was in the same range as that of the radiolucent cement; however, the diffusion coefficients calculated according to the Fick's law were higher for the iodine-containing materials. The addition of 5 wt% of the iodine-containing methacrylate provided a significant increase in the tensile properties with respect to either control radiolucent formulations or BaSO4-containing formulations. Biocompatibility of the modified cements was studied by implantation of rods of the cements into rats and histological analysis of the surrounding tissue. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Protein adsorption on latex particles applied as model for intravenous drug carriers was analysed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The particles were incubated in citrated plasma, serum and heat-inactivated serum, respectively. Incubation in the various media resulted in clear differences in the protein adsorption patterns. Two characteristic protein spots were determined to be enriched on the 2-DE gels only after incubation of the particles in serum. Employing N-terminal microsequencing these protein spots were identified to be fragments of the complement protein C3. Enrichment of these particular spots was most likely a result of complement activation by the particles. Mechanism of C3 binding to the particle surface and subsequent inactivation by cleavage are discussed in order to explain the results. It could be demonstrated that 2-DE analysis provides the possibility to distinguish between adsorption and covalent attachment of C3 to particulate surfaces. The findings indicate that complement activation was caused by covalent binding of the C3 component C3b to the particles' surface. The influence of the incubation medium on the in vitro protein adsorption of particulate drug carriers has to be considered when a correlation between the protein adsorption pattern and the in vivo behaviour of the particles is approached.

In our work, three series of polyurethane/liquid crystal composite membranes based on three different kinds of liquid crystal compounds [N-(-4-methyoxybenzylidene)-4'-heptylaniline, 4-pentyl-4'-nitrile-biphenyl and cholesteryl oleyl carbonate] were prepared by casting on glass plates from a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of polymer and liquid crystal at room temperature. In our opinion, the formation of liquid crystal phase on the composite membrane surface is the basic requirement for getting better biomaterial. The result of this work is in accordance with our opinion. The effect of liquid crystal content on the formation of liquid crystal phase was identified by the observation of optical polarization microscopy (OPM). The results showed that the content of liquid crystal in composite membrane must be more than 30% (wt) in order to form liquid crystal phase on the composite membrane surface. The blood-compatibility of the composite membranes was assessed from SEM observation of the platelet's adhesion to membrane's surface, blood clotting time and haemolysis ratio. The observation of platelet's adhesion showed that the platelets gathered together on the pure polyurethane films, but the amount of platelets which were adherent on the surface covered by the liquid crystal phase was fewer than that of pure polyurethane film when platelet-rich plasma was allowed to be in contact with the membranes for Ih at room temperature. The determination of blood clotting time and haemolysis ratio showed that these polyurethane/liquid crystal composite membranes, in which the content of liquid crystal was more than 30% (wt), appear to be beneficial in improving the blood compatibility and reducing the thrombogenicity.

Forty four cavities were prepared in the upper lumbar vertebrae of 11 sheep using a biopsy trocar via a posterior-lateral extracanal percutaneous route and the location was monitored by radiology with a brilliance amplifier. The cavities were 3 mm in diameter. The histological study was performed on 15 cavities which were left empty to give reference data for the model. Histological and histomorphometry results showed that 67% of the surface area of the empty cavities was still empty 3 months after their preparation. Thus, the natural regenerative capacity of vertebral trabecular bone is limited. We performed preliminary percutaneous injections of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and nacre powder to assess whether this bone-defect model would be suitable for further studies on bone repair. Cavities were successfully filled with nacre powder (21 cavities) or PMMA (8 cavities) while monitoring the process by interventional radiology.

The light-induced binding and dissociation of the biomaterials to and from the electrodes, respectively, are electronically transduced. Two systems,including the photostimulated binding and dissociation of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and of anti-DNP antibody to and from functionalized surfaces, are discussed. The application of the systems as optobioelectronic devices and reversible immunosensors is addressed. A mixed monolayer consisting of pyridine and nitrospiropyran (1a) photoisomerizable units assembled on a Au-electrode acts as a command interface for the light-controlled association and dissociation of Cyt c to and from the monolayer. Cyt c binds to the pyridine/1a-monolayer electrode, resulting in electrical contact between the redox protein and the electrode. Photoisomerization of the mixed monolayer to the pyridine/protonated merocyanine state (Ib) results in the electrostatic repulsion of Cyt c and its dissociation from the electrode support. This blocks the electrical contact between Cyt c and the electrode. By the cyclic photoisomerization of the mixed monolayer between the la and Ib states, reversible ""ON""-""OFF"" amperometric transduction of the affinity interactions between the redox protein and the interface is accomplished. Coupling of the photostimulated electrical contact between Cyt c and the electrode surface to the Cyt c-mediated bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of O-2 by cytochrome oxidase provides a means to amplify the transduced electronic signal. A photoisomerizable thiolated dinitrospiropyran (2a) monolayer, assembled on solid supports, acts as a light-active antigen interface that enables the photocontrolled binding and dissociation of anti-dinitrophenyl antibody (DNP-Ab) to and from the interface. The dinitrospiropyran (2a) layer acts as an antigen for the DNP-Ab, whereas the protonated dinitromerocyanine (2b) lacks antigen features for the DNP-Ab. By reversible photoisomerization of the monolayer between the 2a and 2b states, cyclic binding and dissociation of DNP-Ab to and from the monolayer interface is accomplished. The association and dissociation of the DNP-Ab to and from the 2a- and 2b-monolayer states are electronically transduced, using amperometric, Faradaic impedance and microgravimetric, quartz crystal microbalance analyses. The photostimulated binding of an antibody to a photoisomerizable antigen monolayer provides a novel method to design reversible immunosensor devices.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Willner, I (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",,,,,,,52,17,17,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",8756-7938,,,BIOTECHNOL PROGR,Biotechnol.

Functionally, craniosynostosis may be defined as the premature conversion of the dynamic region of growth and resorption between two adjacent bones of the cranium into a static region of bony union. Molecular analysis has blurred the traditional categories of nonsyndromic and syndromic synostosis to some extent, but, in general, the distinctions between the two groups still hold true. The complexity of the congenital anomalies may be limited with the former, whereas the latter usually requires reoperations and correction of the facial skeleton, This article briefly outlines the characteristic deformities produced from nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, Various approaches to surgical correction of the deformities are described. Finally, new biomaterials that are used in the correction of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis are reviewed.","Scottish Rite Childrens Med Ctr, Ctr Craniofacial Disorders, Atlanta, GA USA; Childrens Hosp & Reg Med Ctr, Div Neurol Surg, Seattle, WA USA; Childrens Hosp & Reg Med Ctr, Div Craniofacial Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Seattle, WA USA","Williams, JK (reprint author), 975 Johnson Ferry Rd NE,Suite 500, Atlanta, GA 30342 USA.",,,,,,,94,13,13,0,2,ALLIANCE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP DIVISION ALLEN PRESS,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",1545-1569,1055-6656,,CLEFT PALATE-CRAN J,Cleft Palate-Craniofac.

Ten UCLA abutments were cast in each of 4 alloys: Type ill gold, ceramometal gold, commercially pure grade I titanium, and titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V); 10 ceramic abutments and 30 sterile Branemark System implants were also used. Five abutments of each material and 5 implants were incubated individually in rat bone marrow culture, as were 5 of each abutment attached to an implant; bone marrow cultures not containing test samples were used as controls. Following 17 days of culture, the solution potentials of individual abutments (except ceramic), the implant, and the implant-abutment couples were measured in the test medium. One dish of each group of 5 was then stained for bone nodule mineralization; the remainder were quantified by area for alkaline phosphatase staining. Statistical analysis of measured in vitro potentials showed that the uncoupled samples formed 2 groups, and coupled samples formed 3 groups. Analysis of variance for alkaline phosphatase-positive area values showed no significant differences between coupled or uncoupled groups and the control. Normal cell differentiation and morphology, as well as a lack of zones of inhibition, were observed. Bone nodule mineralization was evident in all groups. It was concluded that the presence of these commonly used implant abutment biomaterials coupled to titanium endosseous dental implants had no adverse effects on the in vitro capacity of preosteoblasts in marrow to differentiate and to form mineralized bone nodules, despite measured differences in solution potentials.","Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Prosthodont, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Natl Def Med Ctr, Canadian Forces Dent Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Halifax, NS, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Appl Oral Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Univ Maryland, Sch Dent, Adv Educ Program Prosthodont, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Taylor, JC (reprint author), 532 Montreal Rd,Suite 214, Ottawa, ON K1K 4R4, Canada.",,,,,,,57,6,6,0,5,QUINTESSENCE PUBL CO INC,CAROL STREAM,"551 NORTH KIMBERLY DR, CAROL STREAM, IL 60188-1881 USA",0882-2786,,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Anorganic bovine bone (Bio-Oss) has been reported to be osteoconductive, and no inflammatory responses have been observed with the use of this biomaterial. One of the main questions pertaining to Bio-Oss concerns its biodegradation and substitution by host bone. Some investigators have observed rapid replacement by host bone, while other researchers observed slow resorptive activity or no resorption at all. The aim of the present study was to conduct a long-term histologic analysis of retrieved specimens in humans where Bio-Oss was used in sinus augmentation procedures. Specimens were retrieved from 20 patients after varying peri ods from 6 months to 4 years and were processed to obtain thin ground sections. Bio-Oss particles were surrounded for the most part by mature, compact bone. In some Haversian canals it was possible to observe small capillaries, mesenchymal cells, and osteoblasts in conjunction with new bone. No gaps were present at the interface between the Bio-Oss particles and newly formed bone, in specimens retrieved after 18 months and 4 years, it was also possible to observe the presence of osteoclasts in the process of resorbing the Bio-Oss particles and neighboring newly formed bone. Bio-Oss appears to be highly biocompatible and osteoconductive, is slowly resorbed in humans, and can be used with success as a bone substitute in maxillary sinus augmentation procedures.","Univ G dAnnunzio, Sch Dent, Chieti, Italy; Univ Padua, Sch Dent, Padua, Italy; UCL Eastman Dent Inst Oral Hlth Care Sci, London, England","Piattelli, A (reprint author), Via F Sciucchi 63, I-66100 Chieti, Italy.",apiattelli@unich.it,"Orsini, Giovanna/B-5470-2016; Scarano, Antonio/F-6961-2017","Orsini, Giovanna/0000-0002-2641-0695; Scarano, Antonio/0000-0003-1374-6146; favero, gian antonio/0000-0002-9126-2393",,,,34,301,314,0,30,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Silanes on different PEG molecules formed covalent bonds by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation. Addition of monosilylated PEG resulted in the incorporation of dangling PEG chains, which increased the swelling ratio of the hydrogels slightly. PEG hydrogels in microspheres were prepared by emulsifying aqueous silylated PEG solution in oil followed by curing. Crosslinked PF127 hydrogels displayed inverse thermosensitivity. The previously swollen PF127 hydrogels shrank immediately at high temperatures (e.g., 60 degrees C), but the welling of shrunken hydrogels at low temperature (e.g., 5 degrees C) took much longer. The release of fluorescein from the PF127 hydrogels was dependent on the temperature of the environment. The release of fluorescein from the PF127 hydrogels was faster at 45 degrees C than at 5 degrees C. This was most likely due to shrinking of the hydrogels leading to squeezing of the incorporated fluorescein. The ability of hydrogel formation by simple sol-gel transition of silylated PEG can be used to prepare new drug delivery systems and biomaterials.","Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Park, K (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,18,2,2,1,10,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0883-9115,,,J BIOACT COMPAT POL,J.

Al though poly(NVP) is capable of absorbing relatively large amounts of water, it is not prone to hydrolysis. Yet intraocular degradation of several crosslinked poly(NVP) hydrogels has been reported recently, but some ambiguity remains about the exact mechanism of degradation of these materials. To date there is no biomaterial that combines the excellent intraocular biocompatibility on the one hand and controlled kinetics of degradation on the other hand. We attempted to design and prepare such materials through the chemical synthesis of a novel dimethacrylate crosslinker molecule. The essential feature of this molecule is that its core contains two carbonate groups, which are evidently susceptible to hydrolytic scission. We studied a series of 3-dimensional networks of poly(NVP), which were crosslinked by this molecule. This approach offers several advantages: the hydrolysis of the carbonate groups in the crosslinks leads to liberation of poly(NVP) and/or oligo(NVP) chains that can probably be cleared from the eye via phagocytosis; hydrolysis generates two alcohols and CO2 (i.e., there is no catalytic burst effect); when these materials are implanted in dry form, swelling and degradation will progress from the exterior of the material toward its interior. Therefore, these materials can be designed such that surface degradation rather than bulk degradation occurs; the hydrolysis rate can be controlled via the crosslink density or through synthesis of other crosslink molecules with either more (>2) or less (1) carbonate groups or alternatively with one or more other labile groups. We report on the chemical synthesis of the crosslinker molecule, as well, as the preparation and degradation of a series of poly(NVP)-based hydrogels in vitro and in vivo (rabbit eyes). We found that these materials indeed displayed excellent biocompatibility in the rabbit eye. Further, the experiments confirmed that degradation occurs without the burst effect. The results are in line with the idea that the rate of intraocular swelling and degradation depends on the crosslink density, but this is only a preliminary conclusion that must be strengthened by much more experimental work. Nonetheless, we foresee several applications of these or related materials in ophthalmology, for example, as biodegradable matrix materials for controlled drug delivery of ganciclovir in the vitreous body.

This study was performed to evaluate the inflammatory cell recruitment, distribution, and ex vivo metabolic activation of surfaces with different plasma protein adsorption and complement activation properties in vitro. The implants were (1) pure gold (reference), (2) albumin-precoated (3) IgG-precoated gold, and (4) 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol [mercaptoglycerol (MG)] and (5) glutathione (GSH) immobilized to gold. The implant disks were inserted subcutaneously in rats for 24 h, and the number of inflammatory cells that were recruited to the implant adjacent to the surrounding fluid phase (exudate) and the surfaces were quantified by DNA measurements. The oxidative burst was analyzed ex vivo using spontaneous and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated, luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). The in vitro surface-induced anti-rat C3 binding was evaluated by ellipsometry and antibody techniques after plasma incubations for 1 and 30 min. The ellipsometric results showed that immobilized mercaptoglycerol and IgG-coated, but not the immobilized glutathione or the reference Au, bound anti-C3. The in vivo results revealed that the largest amount of cells was associated with the IgG-coated surfaces, followed by immobilized GSH and MG, albumin-coated, and gold surfaces, respectively. No spontaneous es vivo luminol-enhanced CL was recorded from the cells irrespective of surface functionality or localization. A downregulation of surface-associated and exudate leukocyte CL was observed ex vivo, irrespective of surface functionality. The results do not indicate a clear relationship between the degree of complement activation in vitro and leukocyte recruitment and adhesion in vivo for differently functionalized surfaces.

Crosslinking at pH 9.0 (BD90) or with successive epoxy and carbodiimide steps (BD45EN) resulted in a large increase in the shrinkage temperature (T-s) in combination with a clear reduction in amines. Crosslinking at pH 4.5 (BD45) increased the T-s of the material but hardly reduced the number of amines. Acylation (BD45HAc) showed the largest reduction in amines in combination with the lowest T-s. An evaluation of the implants showed that BD45, BD90, and BD45EN were biocompatible. A high influx of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages was observed for BD45HAc, but this subsided at day 5. At week 6 the BD45 had completely degraded and BD45HAc was remarkably reduced in size, while BD45EN showed a clear size reduction of the outer DSC bundles; BD90 showed none of these features. This agreed with the observed degree of macrophage accumulation and giant cell formation. None of the materials calcified. For the purpose of soft tissue replacement, BD90 was defined as the material of choice because it combined biocompatibility, low cellular ingrowth, low biodegradation, and the absence of calcification with fibroblast ingrowth and new collagen formation.

Setting: Central Hospital, Vaasa, and institute of Dentistry and Turku Center for Biomaterials, University of Turku, Finland. Methods: Rabbit corneal tissue cultures were set up on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), heparin-surface-modified (HSM) PMMA, silicone, acrylate, and hydrogel IOLs for 1 week. The tissue consisted of intact epithelium and half the thickness of the corneal stroma, which was placed against the IOL. The growth of the epithelium was examined by light microscopy to evaluate the attachment of the corneal explant to the IOL surface. Results: All tissue samples grew well under the culture conditions. When grown on PMMA, HSM PMMA, silicone, and hydrogel, the tissue did not attach to the IOL or the epithelium grew around the explant, suggesting that the attachment of the st,oma to the IOL was poor or nonexistent. Some explants on acrylate IOLs attached directly to the IOL surface with no epithelial ingrowth between the stroma and the IOL. Conclusions: This tissue culture method can be used to examine the behavior of corneal tissue in contact with different IOL materials. The results suggest that the acrylate IOL may have bioactive properties. This, with the lens optic's square edge, may hinder lens epithelial cell proliferation and thus prevent PCO.

In order to improve the mechanical properties and reliability of HAp based composites, the addition of selected polymers is highly recommended, The main objective of this work is to study the microstructural characteristics of HAp/poly-L-lactide (PLLA) composites obtained by cold or hot processing. The composites were prepared from a mixture of a chloroform solution of poly-L-lactide with granulated HAp. After elimination of chloroform by vacuum evaporation, dense compacts were obtained by cold or hot pressing. The pressing pressure ranged from 98.10 to 294.3 MPa for both cold and hot pressing, The hot pressing was performed in the temperature region 293-457 K for a time period of 15-60 min. Depending on the PLLA amount and the pressing procedure it is possible to obtain highly porous or nearly fully dense composites, The scanning electron microscopy examination of fracture as well as of free surfaces revealed that the final porosity and wetting are affected to a great extent by the synthesis conditions and amount of polymer added. An increase in temperature to 457 K for a longer period of time results in fully dense compacts, The formation of a nearly continuous polymer network that leads to the hardening of HAp has also been observed. However, it should be pointed out that some layers of HAp may be free of polymer film since PLLA penetrates more deeply into the porous HAp.","Serbian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Tech Sci, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Fac Technol & Met Belgrade, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Univ Nis, Univ Ctr Electron Microscopy, YU-18000 Nish, Yugoslavia; Univ Nis, Fac Elect Engn, YU-18000 Nish, Yugoslavia","Uskokovic, DP (reprint author), Serbian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Tech Sci, K Mihajlova 35-4, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia.",,"Ignjatovic, Nenad/C-4489-2008; Uskokovic, Dragan/B-4129-2008","Ignjatovic, Nenad/0000-0002-5749-094X; Uskokovic, Dragan/0000-0002-0421-4968",,,,13,42,42,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-2720,,,J MICROSC-OXFORD,J.

Because endotoxin has many of the same effects as have been reported for wear particles, we hypothesized that adherent endotoxin may be responsible for the biological responses induced by wear particles. We demonstrated the presence of significant levels of adherent endotoxin on commonly used preparations of titanium particles as well as on titanium and titanium-alloy implant surfaces. In contrast, supernatants obtained by centrifugation of particle suspensions contained approximately 1% as much endotoxin as did the particles. Therefore, it is erroneous to assume that particles do not contain endotoxin on the basis of data that it cannot be detected in their supernatants or filtrates. These results emphasize the importance of considering the potential role of adherent endotoxin when examining the in vitro effects of wear particles and the in vivo performance of orthopaedic implants. We also developed a protocol that removed more than 99.94% of the adherent endotoxin from the titanium particles without detectably affecting their size or shape. The removal of adherent endotoxin will allow comparison of the biological responses induced by particles with or without adherent endotoxin.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Greenfield, EM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR07505, AR43769]",,,54,137,140,1,8,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

For this purpose, (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid (H-AMPB-OH) and (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid (H-APB-OH) were synthesized and used to cyclize a bis-cysteinyl-octapeptide giving monocyclic derivatives in which additional conformational restriction could be introduced by conversion to bicyclic structures with a disulphide bridge. While synthesis with H-AMPB-OH proceeded smoothly on a chlorotrityl-resin with Fmoc/tBu chemistry, the poor nucleophilicity of the arylamino group of H-APB-OH required special chemistry for satisfactory incorporation into the peptide chain. Additional difficulties were encountered in the reductive cleavage of the S-tert-butylthio group from the cysteine residues since concomitant reduction of the azobenzene moiety took place at competing rates. This difficulty was eventually bypassed by using the S-trityl protection. Side-chain cyclization of the APE-peptide proved to be difficult, suggesting that restricted conformational freedom was already present in the monocyclic form, a fact that was fully confirmed by NMR structural analysis. Conversely, the methylene spacer in the AMPB moiety introduced sufficient flexibility for facile and quantitative side-chain cyclization to the bicyclic form. Both of the monocyclic peptides and both of the bicyclic peptides are photoresponsive molecules which undergo cis/trans isomerization reversibly.

Identification of the chemiluminescence agent from the whey fraction indicated the participation of lipoxygenase in the emission. The reactivity of lipoxygenase with peroxides in the gallic acid solidus hydroperoxide system was in the order of methylethyl hydroperoxide (MEK-OOH, 4800 cps) > tert-butyl hydroperoxide (terr-BuOOH, 607 cps) > hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 455 cps) > cumene hydroperoxide (cumene-OOH, 261 cps). Emission maxima for H2O2 and cumene-OOH were 670 nm, and emission maxima for MEK-OOH and tert-BuOOH were at 510 nm. The photon intensity from the gallic acid lipoxygenase system corresponded to the linoleic acid hydroperoxide value. A high correlation of photon intensity with hydroperoxide, including linoleic hydroperoxide was useful as a simple and sensitive method for the direct detection of hydroperoxides in biomaterials.

However, the use of synthetic materials is limited to grafts larger than 5-6 mm because of the frequency of occlusion observed with smaller-diameter prosthetics. An alternative to synthetic materials would be a biomaterial that could be used in the design of a tissue-engineered graft. We demonstrate that a small-diameter (4 mm) graft constructed from a collagen biomaterial derived from the submucosa of the small intestine and type I bovine collagen has the potential to integrate into the host tissue and provide a scaffold for remodeling into a functional blood vessel. The results obtained using a rabbit arterial bypass model have shown excellent hemostasis and patency. Furthermore, within three months after implantation, the collagen grafts were remodeled into cellularized vessels that exhibited physiological activity in response to vasoactive agents.","Organogenesis Inc, Canton, MA 02021 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; KGB Associates Inc, Charleston, SC 29401 USA","Sullivan, S (reprint author), Organogenesis Inc, Canton, MA 02021 USA.",,,,,,,39,213,230,3,34,NATURE AMERICA INC,NEW YORK,"345 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1707 USA",1087-0156,,,NAT BIOTECHNOL,Nat.

The possibility of inhibiting the initial adhesion of neutrophils to biomaterials has been studied extensively, but the problem remains unsolved. In this study, we investigated the effect of HK adsorption on polyurethane, a widely used component of extracorporeal and intracorporeal devices. HK and HKa were allowed to adsorb on 4 different charged polyurethanes: noncharged (PU), cationic (NR4), anionic (SO3), and zwitterionic (GPC) polyurethanes. The effect of kininogen adsorption on neutrophil adhesion, the surface density of the adsorbed kininogen, and the exposure of HK domains 3 and 5 (D-3 and D-5H) which are responsible for the binding of HK to the neutrophil integrin alpha(m)beta(2) or Mac-1, were examined. On PU, NR4, and SO3, kininogen adsorption reached 80% of monolayer coverage when 100 pmol/mL or higher concentration of protein solutions were used. The NR4 surface adsorbed the most kininogen along with a high exposure of D-3 and D-5H. The availability of D-3 and D5H allowed neutrophils to bind to the surface via the Mac-1 receptor; thus, on the NR4 surface, adsorbed kininogens lost their antiadhesive property, which resulted in a high degree of neutrophil adhesion. Increasing Mac-1 expression by exposure to fMLP increased the neutrophil adhesion on this surface. In contrast, exposure of D-3 and D-5H on SO3 was significantly less, because HK binds to anionic surfaces with similar protein sequences used for cell binding. This low binding site exposure preserved the antiadhesive property of HK. GPC was resistant to neutrophil adhesion even in the absence of adsorbed kininogens because of its phosphorylcholine moiety. Thus, both SO3 coupled with kininogen (or kininogen peptides) and GPC have the potential to markedly reduce neutrophil adhesion to biomaterial devices.

However, before these PPy-coated materials can be investigated for their capacity to generate endothelialized luminal surfaces, they must first be studied for their innocuousness in a living environment. The specific goal of the present study was to investigate the in vivo interactions of PPy-coated and noncoated woven polyester materials implanted subcutaneously in rats for prescheduled periods of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days. The in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times were computed for a small area of muscle tissue adjacent to the implants. A correlation was concurrently attempted with blood monocyte activation studies as well as histological observations of the tissue-material interface. The progressive pattern of the slower transversal relaxation time (T-2s) values revealed a more persistent tissue reaction for the most conductive PPy-coated materials and a shorter acute tissue response as the surface resistivity increased. Similarly, the blood monocyte activation studies indicated that the thickness of the PPy coating, which correlated with the conductivity, was directly related to tissue response. Furthermore, both the MR and biological studies showed that the PPy-coated material with a high surface resistivity displayed the lowest tissue reaction over the entire period of implantation. The results obtained from the blood monocyte activation studies and histological observations correlate well with the noninvasive MR measurements of the body's healing process. The conductive materials with high surface resistivities must be further investigated. Finally, the noninvasive nature of MR relaxometry reveals its outstanding potential for future in vivo investigations of the body's tissue interactions with polymers and nonferromagnetic biomaterials.","Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Quebec Biomat Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Rheumatol & Immunol Res Ctr, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,52,19,20,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

One hydroxyapatite ceramic (S-HA), macroporous implants with rough pore walls containing abundant micropores, was made by Sichuan Union University (Chengdu, China); the other hydroxyapatite ceramic (J-HA), porous implants with smooth macropore walls composed of regularly aligned crystal grains, was provided by Mitsubishi Ceramic Int. (Japan). Different tissue response was detected histologically and microradiographically after the ceramic samples had been implanted in dorsal muscles of dogs for 3 and 6 months. Bone formation was found in S-HA at 3 months, which increased at 6 months. In contrast, no bone formation was detected in J-HA at both 3 and 6 months. These results indicate that with the special architecture, calcium phosphate ceramic can induce bone formation in soft tissue. As both materials were very similar in their chemical and crystallographic structures, but varied in their microstructures, the latter seem to be an important factor affecting the osteoinductive capacity of calcium phosphate ceramics. These data suggest that, by controlling the preparation of calcium phosphate ceramic, bone substitutes with intrinsic osteoinductive property can be developed from calcium phosphates.

However, contraction or detachment of the capsule can lead to complications. Biocompatibility of biomaterials may be improved by the application of proteins regulating the differentiation or activation of(myo)fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, differentiating from fibroblasts can be identified by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SM actin). We investigated the influence of proliferation and quiescence on the differentiation of porcine dermal cells and whether transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in the differentiation of proliferating cells. Porcine cells were used because pigs increasingly function as in vivo models while little is known of the characteristics of their cells. Serum-free cultured, quiescent fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, while proliferating fibroblasts cultured in the presence of serum containing TGF-beta, formed alpha-SM actin-negative cell clusters. After reaching confluency, these clusters started to expressing alpha-SM actin. Moreover, these proliferating cells produced TGF-beta from day 4 onwards while bFGF did not. Differentiation into myofibroblasts was inhibited by bFGF and to an even greater extent by antibodies to TGF-beta. Further, two theories concerning the role of the myofibroblast in tissue contraction in view of two biomaterial application will be discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The reliability of the estimation by fluorescence image analysis was validated by comparison with visual counting and with results obtained by an electronic particle counter. In this way it was possible to demonstrate that the adhesive properties of bone cells are dependent on the type of substrate-enstatite (MgO, SiO2, CaO-P2O5-Al2O3), Thermanox(R) (modified polyethyleneterephthalate), or glass. In contrast, the spread of the cell cytoplasm, labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and measured by image analysis, does not vary significantly according to the substrate. The characterisation by SKIZ tessellation of the spatial cell arrangement shows that the bone cells have a random organisation on Thermanox(R) and glass, whereas they form aggregates on enstatite.

The new approach essentially rests upon photochemical immobilisation of the highly biocompatible polymer poly(N-vinylpyrrolidinone) (poly(NVP)) onto the biomaterial's surface. One of the key steps in the surface modification procedure is the preparation of a copolymer of NVP and the photoreactive building block 4-[4'-azidobenzoyl]-oxo-n-butylmethacrylate (1). This copolymer is first dissolved in a volatile solvent, then sprayed onto the biomaterial's surface, and subsequently immobilised via irradiation with ultraviolet light. The paper describes: (i) preparation of 1, (ii) preparation of the copolymer (NVP + 1), (iii) physico-chemical characterisation of the modified surfaces, and (iv) results of two in vitro haemocompatibility assays (i.e. thrombin generation and adhesion of blood platelets from recalcified human platelet-rich plasma). Furthermore, the surface modification was performed with a microporous polyurethane vascular graft (Chronoflex (R)), which is already in clinical use. The in vitro experiments revealed that significant improvement of the haemocompatibility of polyurethanes can be achieved through this method. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The most frequent causes are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Several studies have been devoted to identify adhesion mechanisms for these bacteria. Slime in particular has been extensively investigated. Recently, in Staphylococcus aureus species, considerable attention has been given to the host protein receptors that have been shown in in vitro assays to serve as substrates for bacterial adhesion. Collagen-rich tissues, as bone and cartilage, that are the preferential sites of staphylococcal infections, are also the tissues that harbour orthopaedic implants. These can be easily coated in vivo by collagen and thus become prone to adhesion of Staphylococci strains which carry the collagen adhesin gene (cna). In this study the frequency of cna was determined within a collection of 35 Staphylococcus aureus strains from orthopaedic prosthesis infections by a PCR method. Also the collagen-binding ability and slime forming capacity was evaluated. 29% of the strains were cna-positive and also able to bind collagen in vitro. 83% of the strains were slime forming. The results indicate that in the examined bacterial population slime-positive strains predominate over the cna-positive strains, with a striking association of the two adhesion mechanisms in cna-positive strains.

Results show that use of two instruments, MacroCut, Leica, Germany, and the Bioimaging Analyzer with IF, Fuji Photo Film, was essential to produce macroautoradiographs for QWBA data. The remaining problems include the process for freezing the animal carcass and the process for freeze-drying or lyophilizing the frozen sections of the biomaterials.

Catheter thrombogenicity was evaluated in humans during angiographic procedures by their tendency to become occluded. Characterization of catheters was achieved using roughness measurements, FTIR with ATR, DSC and ESCA. The catheters were 5 commercially available catheters, made mainly of polyethylene, Pebaux(R) or polyamide sterilized and ready for clinical use. Thirty-one patients due to have an angiographic procedure and with normal blood and hemodynamic parameters were included in the study. The 50 cm catheter test sample was inserted through an introducer into the femoral artery at the beginning of an angiographic procedure. The outcoming blood flow rate (BFR) was continuously monitored by a special computerized device for 15 min or until the total amount of blood reached 30 ml. The angiographic procedure was then normally resurned. DSC and FTIR showed results consistent with the expected composition of catheters. ESCA results showed very high Si/C ratios and could not be explained in all instances. Occlusion of the catheters occurred in 44 % of the cases and the average time to obtain occlusion was 8.5 min (3-15 min). Values of the decrease rate of BFR in ml/min(2) allowed separate of the catheters into 3 groups of low, medium and high thrombogenicity. However, occlusion occurred at least one time for each type of catheter. Blood volume and BFR curves vs. time allowed the determination of 3 main types of thrombotic behavior: type I shows no significant reduction of BFR; type II shows a progressive decrease in flow rate; type III is much less frequent and shows an abrupt decrease of BFR either quickly followed by a compensatory increase and resuming of a steady flow or by abrupt occlusion. in type N curves the pattern of occlusion follows a classical diffusion model because the Peclet number is greater than I and then the classical Higble solution for diffusion could be used (33). The most thrombogenic material was the smoothest. There was no correlation between surface chemical composition and thrombogenicity. However, catheters that were based on PE appeared less thrombogenic than PA catheters in this study.","Univ Paris 11, Ctr Etud Pharmaceut, Lab Biomat & Polymers, URM 8612, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; Claude Bernard Res Fund, Lab Neuroradiol & Therapeut Angiog, Paris, France; Hop St Francois Assise, Inst Biomat Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Lab Biorheol Hydrodynam & Physiochem, Paris, France","Lautier, A (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, Ctr Etud Pharmaceut, Lab Biomat & Polymers, URM 8612, 5 Rue JB Clement, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France.",,,,,,,44,8,8,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0391-3988,1724-6040,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

As these applications involve surgical insertion of gels, the effect of cross-linking on mechanical properties is relevant. The effect of cross-linking on the gel water uptake is also relevant for the kinetics of drug release. Equally important is the influence of initial amounts of gelatin in the gelling solutions. We investigated the influence of cross-linking (with glutaraldehyde) and of gelatin content upon the equilibrium water content and tensile properties of resulting gels. A range of gels was prepared with gelatin contents of 10 to 40% wt, and cross-linked with 2.5 to 50% wt glutaraldehyde. The increase in gelatin content and degree of cross-linking reduced the water uptake of gels from about 60-65% wt to about 50% wt. The tensile characteristics were differentially affected. While the increase of cross-linking induced a decrease of toughness and elasticity and an increase of stiffness, it did not affect the ultimate strength of gels. On the contrary, the increase of gelatin content induced a definite increase of the ultimate strength but did not significantly affect the other properties.","Univ Western Australia, Dept Biomat & Polymer Res, Lions Eye Inst, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Ctr Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",,,"Lou, Xia/A-7333-2010","Lou, Xia/0000-0002-4052-8200",,,,23,32,34,3,18,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0885-3282,,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

As there is no effective method currently available to prevent such biomaterials from calcifying, a practical solution is to use only materials with a relatively high resistance to calcification, to extend ventricular durability and ensure a longer functional life for the manufactured device. In the present study, an in vitro calcification protocol was used to determine the relative resistance to calcification of six different polyurethanes, namely, Carbothane(R) PC3570A, Chronoflex(R) AR, Corethane(R) 80A, Corethane(R) 55D, Tecoflex(R) EG80A, and Tecothane(R) TT1074A, The results demonstrated that all sis polyurethanes did become calcified during the 60-day incubation period in the calcification solution, The degree of calcification was found to be associated,vith the surface chemistry of the particular polyurethane, with the Tecothane TT1074A exhibiting the highest level. The Corethane 80A and 55D polymers showed a relatively low propensity to calcify. These two membranes can, therefore, be considered as the most appropriate materials for the fabrication of ventricles for a totally implantable artificial heart. In addition, since the calcification occurred primarily at the surface of the membranes, without affecting the bulk microphase structure, the issue of modifying the surface chemistry to reduce the incidence of calcification is discussed.

Macrophages phagocytose orthopedic debris and release the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2. In addition, other immunologic-agents, such as interferon-gamma, are present in tissues harvested from the bone-implant interface of failed orthopedic implants. The present study examined the effects of interferon-gamma on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particle-challenged monocyte/macrophages in vitro. The effects of interferon-gamma were determined by measuring interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release by primary human monocyte/macrophages following exposure to PMMA particles. Exposure of the monocyte/macrophages to PMMA particles resulted in a dose-dependent release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at 48 h. The interleukin-6 release in response to PMMA particle challenge was stimulated by 76% and 127% in the presence of 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL of interferon-gamma, respectively. Interferon-gamma challenge alone did not alter interleukin-6 release relative to controls. In contrast to interleukin-6, interferon-gamma challenge stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha release in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of particles, addition of 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL of interferon-gamma resulted in 17% and 171% increases in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, respectively, relative to cultures challenged solely with particles. Blocking antibody to IFN-gamma inhibited the effect of IFN-gamma on particle-induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release. The data presented in this study demonstrate that the immunologic modulator interferon-gamma exacerbates monocyte/macrophage release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to PMMA particle challenge in vitro.

Polymyxin B (PMB) is a polypeptidic antibiotic which undergoes thermodamage above 60 degrees C. The dynamic compaction method was developed to consolidate the drug load on CaP powder without external heating. Two projectile velocities (50 and 25 m/s) were used here to achieve powder consolidation. Among the different techniques used to associate therapeutic agents with CaP, wet adsorption was performed before the dynamic compaction process. The PMB release profile was measured by a capillary electrophoresis technique, CaP crystallography was studied by x-ray diffraction, and Cap physicochemical analysis was performed by infrared spectroscopy. The biological activities of PMB-loaded compacted CaP were determined by the effect of the antibiotic and monocyte/macroyhage degradation on compact surfaces. PMB release began after 2-3 days of incubation for blocks compacted at 25 m/s velocity and on day 5 for those compacted at 50 m/s velocity, a discrepancy was noted between the amounts of PMB released (0.5-2.1 mg) and the amounts initially compacted (2-8 mg) with CaP powder. The biological activities (antibacterial activity and inhibited lipopolysaccharide effects on monocyte/ macrophage CaP degradation) of PMB released from compacted calcium-deficient apatite were unaltered. Thus, dynamic compaction allows PMB to be used with Cap ceramics without any loss in its integrity and biological effects.

These biomaterials were obtained by associating a biphasic calcium-phosphate (BCP) ceramic mineral phase with a 3% aqueous solution of a cellulosic polymer (hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose). Both materials were injected for periods of 2, 3, 8, or 12 weeks into bone defects at the distal end of rabbit femurs. Quantitative results on new bone formation, BCP resorption, and staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity were studied for statistical purposes. Measurements with scanning electron microscopy and image analysis showed that the final rates of newly formed bone were similar for both tested IBS after 12 weeks of implantation. Bone colonization occurred more extensively during early implantation times for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500. For the latter, BCP degradation occurred regularly throughout the implantation period, whereas it was very intensive during the first 2 weeks for IBS 40-80. Positive TRAP-stained degradation cells were significantly more numerous for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500 regardless of implantation time. With the granulometry of either mineral phase, both tested IBS supported extensive bone colonization, which was greater than that previously reported for an equivalent block of macroporous DCP. The resorption-bone substitution process seemed to occur earlier and faster for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500. Both tested IBS expressed similar biological efficiency, with conserved in vivo bioactivity and bone-filling ability.

To find new synthetic absorbable polymers with plastic nature that can be used as BMP-carrier materials, six types of poly-D,L-lactic acid-polyethylene glycol block copolymer (PLA-PEG) with various molecular weights of PLA and PEG were synthesized. These were PLA6,500-PEG3,000 (P-1), PLA11,500-PEG3,000 (P-2), PLA17,500-PEG3,000 (P-3), PLA6,500-PEG1,000 (P-4), PLA15,000-PEG8,000 (P-5), and PLA8,500-PEG1,000 (P-6). Fifty milligrams of these polymers was mixed with 0 mu g (control) or 5, 10, or 20 mu g of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2). These pellets were implanted into the dorsal muscle pouches of 144 mice (six pellets consisting of the same polymer and dose of rhBMP-2 for a specific group). Three weeks aft-er surgery, the pellets were harvested and examined by radiographic and histological methods. All P-1 pellets with 10 or 20 mu g of rhBMP-2 showed bone formation with hematopoietic marrow and bony trabeculae, as did one third of those with 5 mu g of rhBMP-2. The incidence of new bone formation with P-2 pellets or that of P-5 pellets was lower than that of P-1 pellets. No bone was formed in any other type of pellet. These results indicated that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 polymer with plastic properties was found to work well as a BMP carrier.

Endothelial cell cultures represent a valuable tool not just in haemocompatibility testing, but also in the concept of designing hybrid organs. In the past endothelial cells (EC) have frequently been used in cytotoxicity testing of materials, especially polymers, used in blood-contacting implants, as well as for investigating seeding technologies for vascular prostheses. At present the exponential development both in theory and practice of cell and molecular biology of the endothelium offers great promise in the biomaterial field. Up until now this EC research field has mostly been non-biomaterial orientated. Nevertheless, the relevance for biomaterial research is apparent. Four aspects will be concisely reviewed under the headings inflammation, with special reference to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and cytokines, angiogenesis, focusing on the healing response, signal transduction, presenting examples from cytokine- and metal ion-induced up-regulation of genes coding for CAMs, and, finally, endothelial functionality, with emphasis on the principal characteristics of the physiological endothelial phenotype. Finally, the application of these fields to three foci of biomaterial research will be discussed, emphasizing the role of EC culture techniques in controlling the host response to biomaterials (microvascular EC), controlling EC functionality (promoting positive effects and down-regulating negative effects), and tissue engineering (integration of EC into hybrid organs/biosensors). The need for more co-culture and three-dimensional models will be stressed and data from the authors' laboratory presented to illustrate these principles.

In an attempt to understand some of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of the control of cell differentiation in the presence of two different materials, Chronoflex (CH) and plasma treated Chronoflex coated with Hyaluronan (CH-HA), we used primary cultures of human myogenic cells, a model that encompasses cell proliferation, migration, fusion, and differentiation dependent gene activation. By testing both the material samples on the growth of human myoblasts in primary cultures, we demonstrated that both CH and CH-HA substrates were able to support the cell growth since they did not affect cell count and DNA synthesis. On the contrary, the degree of myoblast differentiation, assessed as a function of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity on living cells, was completely different on the two biomaterials. Indeed, the amount of CPK increased on CH-HA cultured cells as a result of myotube formation, while CH grown myoblasts remained unfused and displayed no increase on the CPK activity even after 12 days culture. Moreover, the expression level of MyoD and myogenin mRNA, both related to myogenic cell differentiation, appeared extremely low in CH-grown cells, while they were rapidly induced in CH-HA cultured myoblasts.

In this paper, several in vitro and in vivo techniques are presented to demonstrate means of delineating a part of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between biomaterial and macrophage adhesion and phenotypic development. The following conclusions were reached: (1) using radioimmunoassay, complement component C3 was found to be critical in mediating human macrophage adhesion on polyurethanes. (2) The presence of a diphenolic antioxidant additive in polyurethanes increased the propensity for complement upregulation but did not affect adherent macrophage density. (3) The subcutaneous cage-implant system was utilized to delineate interleukin-4 participation in the fusion of adherent macrophages to form foreign body giant cells in vivo in mice. The injection of purified interleukin-4 neutralizing antibody into the implanted cages significantly decreased the giant cell density; conversely, the giant cell density was significantly increased by the injection of recombinant interleukin-4 when compared with the controls. (4) The RGD and PHSRN amino acid sequences of the central cell binding domain and the PRRARV sequence of the C-terminal heparin binding domain of human plasma fibronectin were utilized to study the structure-functional relationship of protein in mediating macrophage behavior. Polyethyleneglycol-based networks grafted with the RGD-containing peptide supported higher adherent human macrophage density than surfaces grafted with other peptides. The formation of foreign body giant cell was highly dependent on the relative orientation between PHSRN and RGD domains located in a single peptide.

In vitro models include the use of bone explant cultures, fetal rat calvarial-derived osteoblast cells, primary stromal populations, transformed and non-transformed cell lines and immortalized osteoblast cell lines. However, these assessments are limited by the extent of osteogenic differentiation and bone formation that can be observed in vitro, species differences and phenotypic drift of cells cultured in vitro. The use of in vivo experimental systems such as the segmental/calvarial bone defect model, the subcutaneous implant model and the diffusion chamber implantation model circumvent some of these issues and, in the appropriate model, provide data on efficacy, biocompatibility and osteointegration of a biomaterial. The combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches together with the development of new cell labeling techniques, in particular the ability to genetically mark and select specific human bone cell populations provides new avenues for their potential evaluation in combination with appropriate biomaterials for clinical use. These in vitro and in vivo techniques are reviewed and those recently developed for assessment of human osteogenic cells should be applicable to many other cell systems where knowledge of specific human tissue or cell interactions with biomaterials is required.

This requires an understanding and appreciation of the biological interactions which occur in the ocular environment and their relevance with respect to the clinical complications associated with surgical implantation of devices. This paper describes the development of a series of clinically reflective in vitro assays for assessing the potential ocular compatibility of novel intraocular lens materials. Staphylococcus epidermidis attachment, fibrinogen adsorption, mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 adhesion and proliferation, primary rabbit lens cell adhesion, human peripheral blood macrophage adhesion and granulocyte activation tests were employed to evaluate two widely used intraocular biomaterials poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone, and a novel biomimetic phosphorylcholine-based coating (PC). The performance of these materials in the in vitro assays was compared to their ability to reduce postoperative inflammation in vivo in a rabbit model. The results demonstrated that the in vitro assays described here are predictive of in vivo ocular compatibility. These assays offer a more relevant means of assessing the ocular compatibility of biomaterials than those presently required by the authorities for regulatory approval of medical devices and implants.

The coatings obtained were analyzed with XPS and contact angle measurements showing hydrophilic chains of different lengths extending away from the surface. Bacterial adhesion was measured with a clinically relevant Klebsiella pneumoniae type strain and measurements reproduced 12 times. Bacterial adhesion decreased markedly with increasing hydrophilic chain length. Based upon these findings a new model for bacterial adhesion to hydrogel-coated surfaces is suggested: steric repulsion effects that increase with increasing chain length of grafted hydrophilic chains play an important role in bacterial adhesion to hydrogel-coated surfaces.

In this study, we address the use of a degradable gelatin DDS, for the combined release of therapeutic levels of both gentamicin and growth hormone (GH). An initial bolus release was observed during the first 24 h followed by a reduced, but sustained, release for both drugs up to 14 days. Bioactivity of gentamicin was demonstrated by growth inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus for over 96 h with a mean zone of inhibition of 29.4 mm (+/- 0.19) for the time period studied. Furthermore, GH was shown to have a direct effect on primary human osteoblast-like (HOB) cells, stimulating proliferation and enhancing their differentiation. Site-specific drug delivery offers the advantage of localizing a drug directly at the target site, thus minimizing systemic effects. The results of this study suggest that gelatin is a good DDS for the combined release of drugs. In addition, gelatin is both biocompatible and biodegradable, thus making it a promising DDS for the management of acute and chronic bone and tissue infection such as osteomyelitis.

The availability of appropriate biomaterial devices is essential to allow in vitro cultured cells to behave as in the original tissues in vivo. In our studies we utilized a seminatural biomaterial made up by the benzyl ester of hyaluronan to grow keratinocytes, fibroblasts and chondrocytes. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were isolated from human foreskin. Cells were separately cultured on two different hyaluronan based biomaterial devices for the first 15 days and then co-cultured for an additional period of 2 weeks. Keratinocytes gave rise to a well-differentiated epithelial layer, while fibroblasts were able to synthesize all the main extracellular molecules inside the biomaterial spaces, forming dermal-like tissues. When these two tissues were co-cultured, a skin equivalent was formed with a dermal-epidermal junction. Chondrocytes were obtained from chick-embryo sterna and cultured for 21 days inside a non-woven scaffolding made up of a hyaluronan-based biomaterial. Cells were able to organize themselves into nodules embedded in a dense metachromatic substance in which type II collagen was present. Data from this study suggest that this novel class of hyaluronan derived biomaterials is suitable for different cell culture and in vitro tissue reconstruction.

This paper discusses development of biomaterials for conductive, inductive and cell-based tissue replacement strategies. Biodegradable polymer scaffolds can be used as space-filling matrices for tissue development and barriers to migration of epithelial cells in tissue conductive approaches. Inductive approaches involve sustained delivery of bioactive factors, such as protein growth factors and DNA, to alter cell function in localized regions. Factors can be released from highly porous polymer scaffolds to allow factor delivery and tissue development to occur in concert. Cell-based approaches involve seeding of cells onto polymeric scaffolds in vitro and subsequent transplantation of the scaffold. New scaffold materials are being developed that address specific tissue engineering design requirements, and in some cases attempt to mimic natural extracellular matrices. These strategies together offer the possibility of predictably forming specific tissue structures, and may provide solutions to problems such as periodontal ligament detachment, alveolar bone resorption and furcation defects.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Mooney, DJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, 2300 Hayward St,3074 HH Dow Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Murphy, William/I-4096-2014",,,,,50,84,88,1,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0022-3484,,,J PERIODONTAL RES,J.

Also, freeze dried hides were examined by DR FTIR in order to detect the presence and structure of collagen-chromium complexes. Comparisons of HATR and DR FTIR show that the expected chemical changes in the hide can be observed. The quality of the spectra obtained is comparable to that reported by biomedical research groups.

However, in some applications it is necessary to treat ultra-fine sub-micron particles that have been purposely aggregated to increase their apparent size in order to make centrifugal separation feasible. For some time the possibility of processing of slurries containing aggregates (eg ceramics, minerals, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, biomaterials, etc) has been considered doubtful since it was presumed that shear forces within the hydrocyclone would tend to render such operations ineffective by breaking up the aggregates. The complex mechanisms involved in the separation of aggregates have not allowed a clear understanding of the breakage-separation process, and no model has been available that considers the breakage and separation of particles simultaneously. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of processing dilute suspensions of aggregates using small diameter hydrocyclones by presenting a critical assessment of previous work, and new experimental measurements employing in-situ particle size, density and mass flow measurements for the process streams coupled with robust data reconciliation procedures. A model to describe the breakage-separation phenomenon is proposed and tested. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cells growing from 4 days after subculture (DAS) to 9 DAS and from 16 DAS to 19 DAS showed a diauxic growth, and then growth rapidly decreased with further culturing. The AsA content slowly increased to 19 DAS, reached a maximum at 21 DAS (ca 120 mu g/g dry cell mt), and then rapidly decreased with further culturing. GLDase and ASO activity were well correlated with the cell growth curve, showing a maximum at 19 DAS, whereas APX activity showed a good correlation with the changes in AsA content, showing a maximum at 21 DAS, The total ascorbate contents (reduced form, AsA, and oxidized form, dehydroascorbate, DHA) were markedly enhanced at 10 DAS when L-galactose and L-galactono-1,4-lactone (25 mM) were added to SH medium supplemented with 20 g/l sucrose at 9 DAS, by 5.5 and 6.8 times, respectively.

In addition, 2D macromolecular ordering is of fundamental interest in the areas of phase behavior and complex fluids. Our work involves the growth of 2D streptavidin crystals to examine protein self-assembly at an interface. Streptavidin molecules bound to a biotinylated lipid monolayer self-assemble into ordered arrangements, creating 2D crystals with distinct macroscopic morphologies and lattice configurations. In this paper, we highlight previous work examining the effects of intermolecular interactions on molecular organization and macroscopic properties in ordered protein arrays. We also describe our recent progress using streptavidin mutants to study specific protein-protein interactions and their effects on crystal properties. We show that specific changes in intermolecular interactions give alternate morphological, crystallographic, and thermodynamic properties in ordered monolayers. We introduce an additional growth direction in a crystal with oblique P1 symmetry by engineering extra hydrogen bonds. These extra interactions kinetically trap the crystal in a less-ordered paracrystalline state; however, a solid-solid phase transition to the more-ordered, thermodynamically favored form occurs over time. Removal of this interaction enables molecules to directly form the more-ordered P1 configuration. The introduction of repulsive forces at this site inhibits P1-crystal formation such that crystals with P2 symmetry grow at conditions normally resulting in P1 crystals. Our results confirm that macrosopic and microscopic changes in 2D crystalline properties can be elicited by selectively altering specific intermolecular interactions. Such specific engineered alterations are useful in producing desired crystals and to further our understanding of protein interactions and assembly.","Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gast, AP (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,89,19,19,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5647,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

This model combines the effects of cells (macrophages), transition metal ions (Fe2+), and polymer stress to promote material biodegradation. The cell and material effects of DEX, either in solution or incorporated into a polyetherurethane matrix (DEX/PEU), were monitored. Cell morphology and hydroperoxide formation in the polymer during cell culturing were characterized. After a subsequent treatment with FeCl2 the development of environmental stress cracking in the polymer was evaluated. We attempted to duplicate the biodegradation of PEU in terms of environmental stress cracking (ESC). Our results support the direct involvement of macrophages in polyetherurethane oxidation, probably by inducing hydroperoxide formation in the polymer structure. Under the influence of stress or strain, polymers with sufficient hydroperoxides degrade in the presence of Fe2+ metal ions in a manner that closely resembles the stress cracking that is observed in vivo. By contrast, polymers treated with either agents that inhibit cell activation and/or the oxidative burst, or with cells with no oxidative burst did not show signs of the biodegradative process. We demonstrated a reduction in hydroperoxide formation and no later ESC development in macrophage-cultured PEU in the presence of DEX in solution or in DEX-loaded PEU. We believe the prevention of initial polymer oxidation by reducing the cell's potential to produce oxidative stress at the tissue-biomaterial interface can directly inhibit the ESC degradation of chronically implanted polymers. The in vitro macrophage-Fe-stress system is a valuable tool for reliable assessment and cost-effective evaluation of biomaterials.

Using a rotating disk system, we investigated Staphylococcus epidermidis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to a polyetherurethane urea (PEUU-A') under shear stress (0-17.5 dynes/cm(2)) for time periods up to 6 h. In addition, the superoxide (SO) release capacity of PMNs after transient exposure to PEUU-A' under shear stress was determined. Bacterial adhesion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed a linear shear dependence, decreasing with increasing shear stress. Overall adhesion in PBS decreased with time. However, bacterial adhesion in 25% human serum was similar for all time points up to 360 min. Adhesion was observed at all shear levels, displaying no shear dependence. In contrast, PMN adhesion demonstrated a strong shear dependence similarly for times up to 240 min, decreasing sharply with increasing shear stress. Although PMNs preexposed to shear stress showed a slightly diminished SO release response compared to fresh cells for all stimuli, it was not statistically significant regardless of the stimulus. We conclude that circulating leukocytes are unable to adhere in regions of high shear which may contain adherent bacteria. In addition, exposure to PEUU-A' and shear stress (in the range 0-18 dynes/cm(2)) is insufficient to cause a depression in the oxidative response of PMNs.

In many cases it is not sufficient to just have the three-dimensional structure of a protein in H2O or in the crystalline state. Often information on the structural properties of a protein is required in the presence of organic solvents, detergent micelles, phospholipid membranes and so on. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been identified as one of the few techniques that can be applied for structural characterisation of proteins in such environments. Here we discuss how this technique is being used to obtain information on protein structure and stability in both aqueous and non-aqueous media.

The changes in molecular weights and thermal properties of PDLLA were studied as a function of the superoxide ion concentration, hydrolysis time, and hydrolysis temperature. The superoxide ion induced fragmentation of PDLLA yielded a mixture of various species with different chain length. A combined size exclusion chromatography (SEC) method with a chemical tagging by phenyl isocyanate revealed that the structure of the oligomer species with the lowest molecular weight formed in the superoxide ion induced degradation mixture was linear. The significant reduction in T-g was consistent with the significant reduction in the molecular weight; of PDLLA, The linear low molecular fragments (dimers and trimers) in the reaction mixture could act as an internal plasticizers to enhance the T-g reduction by increasing the free volume of chain ends. The relationship of T-g with molecular weight of PDLLA followed the general theory of Fox-Flory. The mechanism of simple hydrolysis of ester by superoxide ion proposed by Forrester et al. was modified to interpret the data obtained from the synthetic biodegradable polymers.

Posterolateral lumbar transverse process fusion using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 carried by sintered bovine bone and Type I collagen complex was compared with fusion achieved using autogenous bone graft or sintered bovine bone alone. Objectives. This study examined the efficacy of sintered bovine bone coated with Type I collagen as a carrier of rhBMP-2 for lumbar intertransverse process arthrodesis. Summary of Background Data. Posterolateral intertransverse process arthrodesis using osteoinductive growth factors is performed experimentally in the lumbar spine. The previous studies revealed the efficacy of osteoinductive factors applied to carriers having no bony structures, such as collagen sheet or polylactic acid polymer, for the spinal fusion. However, in their studies, a large amount of osteoinductive proteins have been applied for the spinal fusion. We used the sintered bovine bone ""True Bone Ceramics"" (TBC; Koken Co., Tokyo, Japan) coated with type I collagen as the carrier. True Bone Ceramics is the only biomaterial possessing a natural trabecular structure and an organized crystal of bone minerals. Methods. Twenty-two adult rabbits underwent bilateral lumbar intertransverse process arthrodesis at L4-L5. The animals were divided into four groups and had materials implanted as follows: autologous bone group, grafted autologous corticocancellous bone harvested from the posterior iliac crest; implanted TBC group; TBC collagen group, implanted TBC coated with Type I collagen infiltrating into the porous space; and BMP group, implanted sintered bovine bone coated with Type I collagen infiltrated with 100 mu g of rhBMP-2. Spinal fusion was evaluated by radiographic analysis, manual palpation, biomechanical testing, and histologic examination 6 weeks after surgery. Results. Two rabbits were killed because of infection and lumbar plexus palsy. Radiographs of the BMP group showed a homogeneous fusion mass at the intertransverse area, and stability was confirmed by dynamic radiographs at 3 and 6 weeks after surgery. In the BMP group, a bony mass in the intertransverse a rea was more prominent than in the other groups. The BMP group had a higher fusion rate based on manual palpation than the-other groups, and BMP fusions showed significantly higher tensile strength and stiffer fusion. The histologic findings in the BMP group demonstrated membranous bone and endochondral bone formations between the transverse process and the fusion mass.

Conclusions.

Previous studies focused on hexafluoroethane (C2F6, HFE) and tetrafluoroethylene (C2F4, TFE) as the monomer precursor have shown such surfaces to exhibit unique protein binding capabilities. In this study, slow, surface directed deposition of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6, HFP) films is shown to confer surface functional group presentation that promotes high protein retention. The surface chemistry is controllable over a range of values, and C3F6 films prepared by RF-glow discharge are smooth, homogeneous, and defect free. Surface patterns of the fluoropolymer can be created by direct or photolithographic techniques. Scanning probe microscopic analysis indicates a surface modulus in the range of 1.2 < E-HFP < 5.5 GPa. These results are discussed in terms of the applicability of C3F6 films for coating biomaterials. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

To understand the conformation change under different forces, Glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergilius Niger was used as a protein model. Eight glycolipids(1,2-o-dialkyl-3-o-beta-D-glycosylglycerols and alkyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside) were used as the matrixes for this investigation. It was observed that the GOD can penetrate into neutral glycolipid monolayer and change its conformation in favor of the alpha-helix formation. Moreover, GOD strongly adsorbed to the positive charged glycolipid monolayer and change its conformation in favor of the beta-sheet formation. Enzymatic activity measurements showed that the more the alpha-helix conformation content is in the GOD, the higher activity the GOD will be. This fact suggested a new way to mediate the conformation of protein in organized molecular assemblies, and provided a new thinking for the preparation of biomimetic film and biosensor.

At pH values > 8.0, epoxide groups of BDDGE will react with amine groups of collagen. The effects of BDDGE concentration, pH, time, and temperature were studied. Utilization of a 4-wt % BDDGE instead of 1-wt % resulted in a faster reaction. Whereas similar values of shrinkage temperature were obtained, fewer primary amine groups bad reacted at a lower BDDGE concentration, which implies that the crosslinking reaction had a higher efficacy. An:increase in pH from 8.5 to 10.5 resulted in a faster reaction but reduced crosslink efficacy. Furthermore, an increase in reaction temperature accelerated the reaction without changing the crosslink efficacy. Crosslinking under acidic conditions (pH < 6.0) evoked a reaction between epoxide groups and carboxylic acid groups of collagen. Additional studies showed that no oligomeric crosslinks could be formed. However, hydrolysis of the epoxide groups played a role in the crosslink mechanism especially under acidic reaction conditions. The macroscopic properties of these materials were dependent on the crosslinking method. Whereas a flexible and soft tissue was found if crosslinking was performed at pH < 6.0, a stiff sponge was obtained under alkaline conditions. Reaction of DSC with a monofunctional compound (glycidyl isopropyl ether) led to comparable trends in reaction rate and in similar macroscopical differences in materials as observed with BDDGE.

Design: Five-year retrospective review of clinical cases with at least 2-year follow-up. Patients: A cohort of 60 consecutive private patients with complaints of malar hypoplasia or facial asymmetry. Setting: A plastic surgery clinic. Intervention: Silastic midfacial malar implants were fitted in each patient. Most underwent implantation via the canine fossa approach and in conjunction with another facial plastic procedure. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective patient satisfaction, photographic grading using a visual analog scale, and complications. Results: Of the 60 patients, 51 (85.0%) reported an excellent result after at least a 2-year follow-up. Ten patients (16.7%) had some form of undesirable sequelae; however, only 4 (3.4%) of 118 implants had to be revised. Photographically, all 60 patients graded postoperative improvement. Conclusions: Findings support the contention that the Silastic midfacial malar implant is a safe and effective alloplastic alternative to treat malar hypoplasia and facial asymmetry. The complication and revision rates are acceptable. Relative technical ease of insertion makes malar augmentation an excellent adjunct for rhytidectomy and rhinoplasty.","Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Div Facial Plast Surg, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; McCollough Plast Surg Clin PA, Birmingham, AL USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Lexington, KY USA","Metzinger, SE (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, 2020 Gravier St,Suite A, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",,,,,,,15,21,21,0,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0886-4470,,,ARCH OTOLARYNGOL,Arch.

The distribution of the specific proteins adsorbed on the membrane surface was also determined by a gold-colloid immunoassay. Albumin, gamma-globulin and fibrinogen were observed on every membrane surface after contact with plasma. However, in the case of the blended membrane, the density of the adsorbed proteins decreased compared with that of original PSf membrane. That is, the MPC polymer blended in the membrane could function as a protein-adsorption-resistant additive. The number of platelets adhered on the PSf membrane was reduced, and change in the morphology of adherent platelets was also suppressed by the modification with the MPC polymer.

The properties of glass polyalkenoate cements based on the generic glass composition (6 + X)SiO2 . (4 - X)Al(2)O(3)1.5P(2)O(5) . 4CaOCaF(2) with varying aluminium to silicon ratio were studied. Setting and working times of the cement pastes, compressive strength, un-notched fracture strength, Young's modulus, fracture toughness and toughness were evaluated for the cements. In contrast to previous studies the aluminium to silicon ratio was not found to influence the cement properties significantly. The high phosphorus content of the glasses studied is thought to reduce the influence of the aluminium to silicon ratio of the glass, as a result of phosphorus locally charge balancing four coordinate aluminium ions in the glass network, as well as providing an additional mechanism of degradation in the form of hydrolysable phosphorus-oxygen bonds.

Bioglass(R) discs were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to preform a calcium phosphate surface layer and subsequently immersed in blank, bovine serum albumin (BSA)- and rM179-containing supersaturated calcification solutions (SCSB, SCSBSA and SCSrM179), respectively. Calcium phosphate layers formed on all the treated samples and were characterized to be apatite by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transmission infrared spectrophotometry. Under scanning electron microscopy, plate-shaped crystals (similar to 50 nm thick and 300-600 nm across) were observed on the samples after PBS incubation. The crystals grown from SCSB were of the typical plate shape except for an increased thickness, while needle-shaped crystals (200-300 nm long and 50-70 nm thick) were precipitated on the SCSBSA-immersed samples. Interestingly, it was found that the crystals deposited on the SCSrM179-immersed samples adopted an elongated, curved shape (similar to 500 nm long and similar to 120 nm thick). Further TEM observations showed that the crystals generated by the SCSrM179 immersion appeared to be composed of bundles of lengthwise crystals (15-20 nm thick) orientated parallel to one another, much alike the long and thin crystals observed in the very early stage of enamel formation. The significant modulation by the rM179 protein of apatite crystal growth is quite different from the overall inhibition observed by BSA and most likely is relevant to the specific function of the amelogenin matrix in controlling enamel crystal growth in vivo.

The materials have two characteristic features: a phase composition which is a mixture of calcium hydroxyapatite and a silicon stabilized tricalcium phosphate, and a microporous morphology based on inter-connected particles (0.2-1 mu m in diameter). X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and light scattering experiments indicate that the characteristic phase composition arises during sintering through substitution reactions where silicon enters the calcium phosphate lattice under conditions of high chemical reactivity. The crystallographic features are linked through the glaserite form of the apatite structure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods: Resins contained one of the epoxies: diglycidyl ether Bisphenol A (GY-6004); 3,4-epoxycyclohexanemethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (UVR-6105); vinyl cyclohexane dioxide (ERL-4206) or the three-epoxy mixture (Epoxy-M). The SOC was t/t-2,3,8,9-di(tetramethylene)-1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane (SOC). The polyols were polytetrahydrofuran (p-THF-250) and polycaprolactone triol (TONE-301). The photoinitiator (4-octylphenyl)phenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate and camphorquinone were used for light curing the resins. Four types of resins (epoxy, SOC/epoxy, polyol/epoxy and SOC/polyol/epoxy) were evaluated for cytotoxicity as solids in the agar diffusion assay and as aqueous extracts in the MTT assay using L929 cells. Results: In agar diffusion analysis, ERL-4206 and UVR-6105 resins were severely cytotoxic (+ + +), but the addition of SOC changed them to non-cytotoxic (-). Addition of 1-3% SOC changed Epoxy-M from mild (+) to non-cytotoxic. Adding SOC changed GY-6004 from moderate (+ +) to mild (-) cytotoxicity. Generally, addition of SOC did not change cytotoxicity when added to polyol/epoxy combinations. Either polyol produced resins with reduced cytotoxicity when added to UVR-6105, but the opposite occurred when added to Epoxy-M resins. In MTT analysis, percent cell survival from 100 mu l resin extracts were statistically compared (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Epoxy-M and GY-6004 resin extracts were significantly less cytotoxic than UVR-6105 and ERL-4206 resin extracts were. Overall, the SOC component reduced the cytotoxicity of all SOC/epoxy combinations, except SOC/ERL-4206, which was significantly more cytotoxic than ERL-4206 resin extract. This may be the result of cell fixative effects observed for SOC/ERL-4206 in agar diffusion analysis. Addition of SOC produced significantly less cytotoxic SOC/polyol/Epoxy-M resins when compared to its non-SOC counterpart. The contrary result was obtained with SOC/polyol/UVR-6105 resin combinations. Consistent with agar diffusion results, adding polyol significantly decreased cytotoxicity of UVR-6105 resins. The cytotoxicity of these resins may be related to the 50% cytotoxicity (TC50) of their components as leachates. The TC50 values of the individual components were compared to BISGMA. Polyols, epoxy monomers, SOC monomer and camphorquinone were significantly(p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than BISGMA. Significance: Addition of SOCs and polyols in the formulation of epoxy-based resins may contribute to development of biocompatible dental composites. (C) 1999 Academy of Dental Materials.

Human gingival fibroblasts were obtained from tissue biopsies of five donors and were cultivated up to 5 weeks under three-dimensional culture conditions. The cells displayed an elongated, spindle-like or stellate morphology resembling the in vivo situation. Collagen type I revealed thick fiber bundles, and collagens type Zn and V were distributed as fine fibrils or small bundles throughout the culture system. Frequently, the fibers were oriented parallel to the long axis of the cells, Type VI collagen formed thin fibers and revealed a reticular pattern. In histological sections the cultured cells exhibited a morphology clearly different from that of cells cultured in monolayers, Their shape and spatial distribution resembled that of cells in tissue biopsies more closely The culture system presented here promotes a dynamic model for performing studies for instance on the interactions of cultured cells with extracellular matrix molecules, on the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes or on the interactions with biomaterials, thus providing qualitative and quantitative information.","Med Univ Hannover, Dept Conservat Dent & Periodontol, Sch Med, D-30623 Hannover, Germany; Med Univ Hannover, Ctr Anat, D-30623 Hannover, Germany","Hillmann, G (reprint author), Med Univ Hannover, Dept Conservat Dent & Periodontol, Sch Med, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,43,22,29,1,4,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0021-9533,,,J CELL SCI,J.

The scope of the symposium extended from current reconstructive techniques for the facial skeleton, including autogenous bone and biomaterials, to potential application of new techniques in molecular biology that may enable the body's own tissues to be engineered to provide bone and cartilage to reconstruct the facial skeleton. The authors review the presentations and relevant literature on biomaterials in the face. The following topics are reviewed: current reconstructive techniques using autogenous bone grafts, methyl methacrylate cranioplasty, demineralized bone, and hydroxyapatite; biomaterials used for rigid fixation, including metallic and bioabsorbable implants; biomaterials used for facial augmentation, including porous polyethylene, hard-tissue replacement, and ceramic biomaterials; biofilm, or a layered polysaccharide matrix secreted by bacteria on the surface of implants; and potential means of inducing bone formation by directing the body's own tissues through cytokine interaction, gene transfer, and tissue engineering.","Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Plast Surg, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Plast Surg, New Haven, CT USA","Gosain, AK (reprint author), Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Plast Surg, 9200 W Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",,,,,,,48,62,65,2,16,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1049-2275,1536-3732,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

A new method for in vitro calcification is employed, in parallel with an in vivo (subcutaneous animal) model. The nature of crystal phases grown by both methods on porcine bioprosthetic heart valves was investigated. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and stoichiometric chemical analysis were used as tools for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the calcification process. Photomicrographs from leaflets calcified early in vitro (24-48 h) and in vivo (5-10 days) confirmed that calcification initiated in the central region of the tissue, mainly in fibrosa, and extended with time (after 28 and 56 days) in vivo towards the outer surface of the tissue. SEM micrographs from tissue sections of early in vivo and in vitro calcified leaflets showed coexistence of different sizes (1-30 mu m) of crystal phases in contact with tissue fibers. EDS analysis confirmed that the deposits were calcium phosphate salts. Chemical analysis of samples calcified in vivo for longer time periods, showed that the content of the salts was mainly calcium and phosphate with a Ca/P molar ratio 1.78 and 1.94 after 28 and 56 days, respectively. These results suggested that the calcification process is followed by a sequential hydrolytic transformation of CaHPO4. 2H(2)O (DCPD) to Ca4H(PO4)(3). 2.5H(2)O (OCP) and to Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH (HAP). Calcium phosphate crystal phases grown in vitro under controlled conditions and at constant super-saturation provide a successful simulation of the calcification process in the animal model and may be applied in screening new biomaterials with respect to their potential for calcification.

The aim of the study was to investigate the features of titanium oxide and titanium nitride layers produced on titanium alloy by plasma nitriding and oxidizing under glow discharge conditions and their biocompatibility in in vitro tests. The plasma nitriding and oxidizing techniques essentially improved the properties of titanium alloys. Their microstructure and the results of hardness, wear and corrosion resistance tests are presented. In the investigations of the, cellular responses of human fibroblast cells to these layers, three aspects were considered: the number of growing cells, their morphological features and their biological corrosion resistance. Nitriding and oxidizing under glow discharge conditions have provided new possibilities of producing non-toxic, human fibroblast-compatible surface layers on parts made of titanium alloys with sophisticated shapes, Uniform surface layers having a controlled microstructure and phase composition can contribute to the opening of a wider application range of titanium alloys as biomaterials.

Ultraviolet light irradiation under sequential charge of vinyl monomers, such as acrylic acid (AA), n-butyl methacrylate (BMA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] acrylamide (DMAPAAm), or styrene (ST), produced block-grafted surfaces, in which different polymer blocks were sequentially formed on polyST (PST) partially derivatized with N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate groups. Examination of a cross-sectional view under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed a bilayered structure of the PST-b-PDMAAm block-graft copolymer. Three different AB-type block-graft-copolymerized surfaces were prepared for biomedical applications, where block A was the bottom layer and block B the top layer: (1) For heparin immobilization, a polyPDMAPAAm (PDMAPAAm) (A)-polyDMAAm (PDMAAm) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block A layer contained ionically immobilized heparin and the block: B layer functioned as a protective layer to suppress protein adsorption and cell adhesion. (2) For protein immobilization, a PDMAAm (A)-polyAA(PAA) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block B layer covalently fixed the protein and the block A layer functioned as a protective layer to prevent contact of the protein with the substrate. (3) For a drug-releasing surface, a PDMAAm (A)-polyBMA (PBMA) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block A layer contained the drug and the block B layer functioned as a barrier to regulate drug release. These macromolecularly designed surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the immobilization of heparin and protein was visualized by light microscopy, after staining with toluidine blue (for heparin), and fluorescence microscopy (for protein).","Natl Cardiovasc Ctr, Res Inst, Dept Bioengn, Suita, Osaka 5658565, Japan","Matsuda, T (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maedashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.",,,,,,,36,57,59,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,AUG 17,1999.0,15,17,,,,,5560,5566,,10.1021/la981581x,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,228EV,WOS:000082124900022,,,,,2019-02-25

Viability was determined before and after freeze-drying and after heat treatment (100 min at 70 degrees C). Freeze-drying with trehalose, PVP, maltose or 1.8-kDa maltodextrin, and mixtures of maltodextrin/ trehalose increased viability in comparison with controls. The 3.6-kDa maltodextrin was ineffective at protecting the cells during freeze-drying. The glass transition temperature (T-g), which depends on moisture content, was indicated as a possible factor to determine the stability of labile materials. Protective effects of the excipients during thermal treatment were analysed in relation to the physical changes (collapse or structural shrinkage) which were dependent on the T-g of the systems. The presence of a certain amount of amorphous disaccharides during freeze-drying and heating was found to be a critical factor for ensuring cell viability, which was protected even in rubbery (above T-g) matrices.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ind, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Quim, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Buera, MP (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ind, Ciudad Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Buera, Pilar/0000-0001-9290-7299",,,,32,58,63,1,10,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0175-7598,,,APPL MICROBIOL BIOT,Appl.

Granules of natural coral of specific diameter, between 100 and 500 mu m, having high content of calcium (> 98%) and a homogeneous surface adsorb glycosaminoglycans with different capacity. Heparin (maximum adsorption 1.29 +/- 0.10 mg/20 mg of coral, 6.45% w/w) is adsorbed more than highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate species (maximum adsorption of 0.90 +/- 0.06 mg/20 mg of coral, 4.50% w/w), chondroitin sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.72 +/- 0.06 mg/ 20 mg of coral, 3.60% w/w), dermatan sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mg/20 mg of coral, 3.50% w/w) and heparan sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.72 +/- 0.07 mg/20 mg of coral, 3.60% w/w). Hyaluronan is not adsorbed onto granules of coral. The percentage adsorption of polyanions onto coral depends mainly on their charge density, with sulfate groups being more important than carboxyl groups. This study found no evidence that iduronic acid is more important than glucuronic acid and no role of molecular mass on the adsorption of polysaccharides onto coral was found. The adsorption of glycosaminoglycans is driven by electrostatic interactions with calcium sites of coral that are dependent on pH and blocked in the presence of large amounts of salt. Due to these peculiar properties, the combination of granules of natural coral with glycosaminoglycans makes this material potentially useful in osseointegration in bone metabolism or periodontal therapy.

Because polydimethyl siloxane surfaces have good hemo- and bio-compatibility, it is generally believed that surface biocompatibility may be improved by modifying biomaterial surfaces with silicone-like properties. For this, we developed a series of polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone (PDMS-PCL) copolymers. By mixing the substrate material-polyvinyl chloride-with law concentrations (1.2 and 2.4%) of the PDMS-PCL copolymer, we generated materials with silicone-like surface properties as reflected by increased surface silicon content and surface contact angles. We assessed the biocompatibility of these surfaces in vitro and found that the addition of PDMS-PCL significantly reduced the percentages of surface-'denatured' fibrinogen, a critical element of genesis of many adverse responses to implanted biomaterials. Indeed, using an animal implantation model, we find that PDMS-PCL-blended materials triggered significantly weaker inflammatory responses than did polyvinyl chloride, the substrate control. The results from these experiments suggest that the use of PDMS-PCL additives (2.4%) in polymer blends is a useful means of camouflaging the substrate surface properties and improving the biocompatibility of biomaterials.

However, knowledge of the origins and phenotypic characteristics of these progenitors and the controlling factors that govern bone formation and remodeling to give a functional skeleton adequate for physiological needs is limited, Practical methods are currently being investigated to amplify in in vitro culture the appropriate autologous cells to aid skeletal healing and reconstruction. Recent advances in the fields of biomaterials, biomimetics, and tissue engineering have focused attention on the potentials for clinical application, Current cell therapy procedures include the use of tissue-cultured skin cells for treatment of burns and ulcers, and in orthopedics, the use of cultured cartilage cells for articular defects. As mimicry of natural tissues is the goal, a fuller understanding of the development, structures, and functions of normal tissues is necessary. Practically all tissues are capable of being repaired by tissue engineering principles. Basic requirements include a scaffold conducive to cell attachment and maintenance of cell function, together with a rich source of progenitor cells. In the latter respect, bone is a special case and there is a vast potential for regeneration from cells with stem cell characteristics. The development of osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipoblasts, myoblasts, and fibroblasts results from colonies derived from such single cells. They may thus, theoretically, be useful for regeneration of all tissues that this variety of cells comprise: bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendons, and ligaments. Also relevant to tissue reconstruction is the field of genetic engineering, which as a principal step in gene therapy would be the introduction of a functional specific human DNA into cells of a patient with a genetic disease that affects mainly a particular tissue or organ, Such a situation is pertinent to osteogenesis imperfecta, for example, where in more severely affected individuals any improvements in long bone quality would be beneficial to the patient. In conclusion, the potentials for using osteogenic stem cells and biomaterials in orthopedics for skeletal healing is immense, and work in this area is likely to expand significantly in the future, (Bone 25:5S-9S; 1999) (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Three delays (12, 24, and 52 weeks) were used. Before death, a double label of oxytetracycline and alizarine was made intravenously, The distribution of implants was randomized, histomorphometric evaluation was performed and compared with micrographic observation, and optical microscopy of stained sections was performed either under visible, ultraviolet, or polarized light, The results were compared with spontaneous healing of empty defects and with a control group of normal cancellous bone from sheeps of the same age. No significant difference has been observed between premolded and injected implants. In the sheep model, the degradation and new bone formation rates are three times slower, compared with those observed previously in rabbits. New bone formation increased from 5.9% (12 weeks) up to 11.0% (24 weeks) in the empty defect group. In the cement groups, 28.3% new bone was obtained at 12 weeks, which seemed then to level off (27.8% new bone at 24 weeks), Cement residues appear as radio-opaque cylinders on microradiographs, In all cases, a radiolucent layer was observed at the cement/bone interface at 24 weeks, Stained sections showed the formation of a fibroconnective capsule around the residual cement, which presumably slows down new bone formation. Nevertheless, quantitative bone remodeling was accelerated in the cement group; mineral apposition as well as adjusted apposition rates were higher, and the formation period as well as the mineralization of osteoid tissue vl ere faster compared with empty cavities and controls, These results point to higher osteoblast activity and better exchange with surrounding tissues in the defects filled with cement, (Bone 25:35S-39S; 1999) (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

However, apatite-copolylactic solids can he steam sterilized without deterioration. Gelatin has been used as a natural polymer to bind apatite particles. Gel exclusion chromatography reveals crosslinking of the chains by irradiation. Standard acrylic cements contain monomers sterilized by ultrafiltration because they do not tolerate irradiation. We have used ultrafiltration to prepare aqueous copolylactic solutions without polymer hydrolysis, Implantation of calcium phosphate cement modified by; copolylactic acid in a rabbit metaphyseal model defect shows progressive substitution of the biomaterial by new bone tissue. At 3 months, a mild inflammatory reaction still remains associated with the continuing resorption of the biomaterial. These results show that interesting biological properties can be obtained with products not sterilized by irradiation.

A large part of the studies has investigated PEG coatings. Nevertheless, there is still controversy about what exactly the properties and modes of action of an 'ideal' PEG coating should be. While some studies have reported no irreversible protein adsorption, other, very similar coatings appear less able to resist bioadhesion. Of great interest are results showing that PEG surfaces with very short chains are capable of rejecting proteins. As it is very difficult to obtain direct information about the microstructure of the coatings, studies typically employ plausible models to interpret observations. New analytical techniques and the direct measurement of interfacial forces between proteins and surfaces open up the possibility of improved, guided design and feedback in the optimization of surfaces intended to resist bioadhesion.

A novel function estimation method was used to extract the material functions from experimental shear data obtained at one strain rate, and the model was used to predict the material response at different strain rates. In general, experiments and predictions were in good agreement, the larger discrepancies being in the prediction of peak stresses and hysteresis in cyclic shear. In shear, Jived tissues are stiffer (mean initial shear modulus, 13 kPa versus 427 Pa), take longer to relax to steady state (mean tau(2) 4,736 s versus 1,764 s) with a slower initial relaxation rate (mean magnitude of (G) over dot(0), 1 s(-1) versus 5 s(-1)) and relax to a lesser extent than fresh tissues (mean percentage stress remaining after relaxation, 60 versus 45 percent). All differences were significant at p = 0.04 or less, except for the initial relaxation slope.

This research sought to develop a histological procedure that would retain the polymer structure. Two processing procedures, paraffin and glycol methacrylate, were tested on three in vitro groups of poly-L-lactide sponges, high cell density seeding, low cell density seeding, and a control.

These soluble macromolecular compounds, which are substituted with specific chemical functional groups, are designed to interact with living systems. By analogy with glycosaminoglycan heparin, a natural highly charged anionic polysaccharide that exerts: a variety of biological effects, vpe postulated that CMDBS compounds also possess binding sites capable of specific interactions with biological constituents, depending on the overall composition of the polymer. The synthesis and heparin-like properties of these CMDBS have been extensively investigated. Thus, it appears that dextran derivatives can mimic the action of heparin in regard to its interactions with antithrombin and serine proteases involved in blood coagulation. Other derivatives interact with various components of the immune system or with adhesive proteins such as fibronectin in modulating the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus. Because they are able to stimulate wound healing in various in vivo models, these polysaccharides may also constitute a family of tissue repair agents because of their protecting and potentiating effects with heparin binding growth factors, Moreover, dextran derivatives in contact with cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or tumoral cells can affect both cell proliferation and metabolism. IL appears that these bioactive polymers are also efficient tools to investigate the precise mechanism of action of individual biological activities by contrasting their mode of action to that of heparin, In addition to their numerous biological properties and biospecificity, functionalized dextrans are relatively simple to manufacture and exempt of donor contaminant, which make them attractive in a variety of clinical applications.

We recently demonstrated that the erythroleukemic cell line K562, which normally grows in suspension, can be induced to grow attached to a polylysine-coated solid surface in an anchorage-dependent manner. In this study, the effects of the growth of K562 cells onto polylysine were further investigated utilizing 500 MHz H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The NMR results showed that when K562 cells are grown attached to a positively-charged polylysine surface, there are alterations in lipids and energy metabolism. In particular, there was a 31% increase in phosphatidylcholine and a 15% decrease in each of its two precursors, glycerophosphatidylcholine and choline, as well as a 20% increase in CH2 lipids and a 7% decrease in CH3 lipids in treated cells compared to the controls. These results suggest that adhesive growth can induce strong variations in membrane structure, including the membrane fluidity of K562 cells. In addition, in cells attached to polylysine there was about a 10% decrease in creatine (together with phosphocreatine), a 20% increase in gamma-glutamate, a 15% increase in beta-glutamate, and a 24% decrease in lactate. This second set of results, which is closely related to energy metabolism, indicates that not only does adhesive growth induce changes in K562 cell membrane structure, but also in the utilization of energy in these cells. The data are discussed in view of the possible role played by surface charge in affecting cell structure and function in cells that come into direct contact with charged biopolymers.

A quadratic response-surface model was developed in order to study the effects of treatment time and temperature (in the range of 1000 degrees C to 1250 degrees C) on scale thickness. The obtained model adequately represents the experimental response and shows that the thickness gradients of the layer increase with the temperature for each exposure time and decrease steadily to zero as the treatment time increases. The microstructural characterization reveals that the alumina scale formed at or above 1000 degrees C consists of an alpha-alumina phase. Treatments at temperatures above 1150 degrees C give rise to an alumina scale with some defect probability. An increase in the temperature up to 1200 degrees C gives rise to the appearance of some blistering of the superficial scale. An oxidation treatment of 100 h at 1100 degrees C was found to be the best for guaranteeing the formation of a defect-free, compact, adherent, and continuous oc-alumina scale thick enough to support satisfactory wear and biological conditions.

Both were two-part epoxies cured at room temperature for 24 h, with material 1 (Ampreg 26; SP Systems Limited, Cowes, UK) postcured at 110 degrees C (T-g similar to 80 degrees C) and Material 2 (CG5052; Ciba Geigy Limited, Cambridge, UK) at 125 degrees C (T-g similar to 120 degrees C). Implantation in dead rabbit bone was performed to provide mechanical baseline levels. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and conventionally HA-coated titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) were used as control materials. In the biological study, different fluorescent dyes were used to label newly formed bone. After 6 weeks of implantation, results from mechanical pushout tests showed that the interfacial shear strength (ISS) values were significantly higher than for dead bones with each of the different implants (p < .01-.001). HA-coated material 2 showed a significantly higher ISS value than the uncoated material (p <.05) after 6 weeks' implantation. However, the ISS value for the uncoated material 2 was significantly higher than for PMMA controls (p <.05). No significant differences in the TSS values were shown between HA-coated materials 1 and 2 and Ti-6Al-4V on in vivo implantation for 6 weeks. Failure points of the pushout test from the three HA-coated materials were defined by scanning electron microscopy. Specimens implanted with both HA-coated epoxies were fractured within the HA-coatings or the bone, while with HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V cracked between the coating and metal implant. The percentage of bone in contact with the implant surface was obtained by image analysis which showed that there were no significant differences between different materials after short time implantation (up to 6 week). Longterm implantation of the HA-coated material 2 showed that the percentage of bone contact had increased from 52.8 +/- 1.1% (6 week) to 80.0 +/- 0.3% (3 months) (p <.01) and remained at 81.0 +/- 0.8% (6 months). Measurements of bone mineralization rate (BMR) showed that after 3 weeks of implantation, there were no significant differences between PMMA and uncoated materials 1 and 2. After 6 weeks, the BMRs in animals implanted with either HA-coated material 1 or 2 were significantly higher than with HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V (p <.05-.0001 in both cases), but with HA-coated material 2 was lower than with this material uncoated (p <.05-.001). No significant differences were found between the two HA-coated epoxy materials. In addition, there were always lower BMRs during the third week of implantation than other periods regardless of biomaterial implanted. The study indicated that the adhesively bonded HA-coated novel epoxy materials were superior to conventional plasma-sprayed Ti-6Al-4V implants with respect to both BMR and bone integration with the implant surfaces. Adhesively bonded HA-coated epoxy materials had similar ISS values to HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V, but the former failed within the bone and coating, while the latter showed splitting between coating and metal.

In the present study, are evaluated histologically and mechanically the effect of alumina crystallinity on the osteoconductivity and bone-bonding strength of the composite. AL-P was manufactured by fusing crushed alpha-alumina powder and quenching it. The AL-P was composed mainly of amorphous and delta-crystal phases of alumina. Its average particle size was 3.5 mu m, and it took a spherical form. Another composite (alpha ALC), filled with pure alpha-alumina powder (alpha AL-P), was used as a referential material. The proportion of powder added to each composite was 70% w/w. Mechanical testing of ABC and alpha ALC indicated that they would be strong enough for use under weight-bearing conditions. The affinity indices for ABC, determined using male Wistar rat tibiae, were significantly higher than those for alpha ALC (p < 0.0001) up to 8 weeks. Composite plates (15 x 10 x 2 mm) that had an uncured surface layer on one side were made in situ in a rectangular mold. One of the plates was implanted into the proximal metaphysis of the tibia of a male Japanese white rabbit, and the failure load was measured by a detaching test 10 weeks after implantation. The failure loads for ABC on its uncured surface [1.91 +/- 1.23 kgf (n = 8)] were significantly higher than those for alpha ALC on its uncured surface [0.35 +/- 0.33 kgf (n = 8); (p < 0.0001)], and they also were significantly higher than those for ABC on the other (cured surface) side (p < 0.0001). Histological examinations using rabbit tibiae revealed bone ingrowth into the composite only on the uncured surface of ABC. This study revealed that the amorphous phase of alumina and formation of an uncured surface layer are needed for the osteoconductive and bone-bonding ability of ABC. ABC shows promise as a basis for the development of a highly osteoconductive and mechanically strong biomaterial.

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London, United Kingdom. Methods: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (Alcon Surgical, model MC60BM) and AcrySof (Alcon Surgical, model MA60BM) IOLs were incubated in physiological concentrations of radiolabeled albumin or fibronectin at 37 degrees C for periods between 5 minutes and 1 week. The IOLs were removed and rinsed in buffered saline, and the amount of adsorbed protein was calculated by measuring the radioactivity with scintillation spectrometry. Results: The adsorption of both proteins occurred rapidly over the first 2 hours; the rate of adsorption was concentration dependent. Quantitative differences were found: PMMA lenses bound significantly greater quantities of albumin. initial fibronectin adsorption to both materials was similar, but increased adsorption to AcrySof IOLs was found at days 1 and 7. Conclusions: The differences in protein absorption to PMMA and AcrySof IOLs in vitro may contribute to the differences in the biological response to these IOLs, including the lower rates of posterior capsule opacification associated with acrylic lenses.

At pH 2.0, these biomass types were capable of sequestering up to 8.0 mu mol g(-1), 7.2 mu mol g(-1) and 3.2 mu mol g(-1), respectively. An adverse effect of increasing solution ionic strength (NaNO3) on gold biosorption was observed. Gold-loaded biomass could be eluted with 0.1 mol dm(-3) NaOH with efficiencies higher than 90% at PPI 5.0 at the Solid-to-Liquid ratio, S/L, =4 (gdm(-3)). Cyanide mass balances for the adsorption, desorption as well as for the AVR process indicated the stability of the gold-cyanide which did not dissociate either upon acidification or upon binding by biomass functional groups. Gold biosorption mainly involved anionic AuCN2- species bound by ionizable biomass functional groups carrying a positive charge when protonated. FTIR analyses indicated that the main biomass functional groups involved in gold biosorption are most probably nitrogen-containing weak base groups. The present results confirmed that waste microbial biomaterials have some potential for removing and concentrating gold from solutions where it occurs as a gold-cyanide complex.

Design: Laboratory investigation using a polyvinylchloride pipe periarticular tibia fracture model. Setting: Simulated periarticular fractures were created in an in vitro tibia fracture model. instrumented specimens and intact controls were elastically tested in a biomaterials testing system. Intervention: Groups of simulated periarticular tibia fractures were stabilized with one of six different hybrid external fixator designs. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness of each specimen was measured in compression, torsion, flexion bending, extension bending, and varus/valgus bending. Results: Fixators with multiple levels of fixation in the peri articular fragment, regardless of design, were stiffer than those with one level. Specifically, the EBI Ring Connector fixator was stiffer than all others in all modes of testing. The Ace, Synthes, Smith & Nephew Richards, and Howmedica fixators were mechanically similar. The Zimmer Torus fixator was the least stiff fixator tested. Conclusions: Fixators with multiple levels of fixation in the periarticular fragment, regardless of design, were stiffer than those with one level. The: choice of which hybrid external fixator to use should be made based not only on stiffness but also on ease of clinical application, patient comfort, customer support from the manufacturer, and cost.

While this is a simple matter when working with free weights and machines, it becomes more difficult with plyometric training, especially in the case of the upper body. Weight training is often performed at intensities approaching 100%. Plyometric training must be performed at an intensity high enough to cause adaptation in the relevant biomaterials but not at intensities so great as to prolong amortization and to compromise the use of the serial elastic component and stretch reflex. Research recommendations exist for lower-body plyometrics, such as the depth jump, that suggest an optimal range of jump heights. Nonetheless, recommendations often do not consider the subject's body mass and impact force. Training loads for upper-body plyometrics performed with medicine balls have not been quantified. This study determines the vertical impact forces of the medicine ball (MB) for the purpose of quantifying training loads of MB drills with a vertical component. Based on results of the regression analysis, the following model was developed: vertical impact force [(height{cm} x 5.58) + (mass {kg} x 59.65)] - 468.30. The regression equation, expressed in pounds, is as follows: vertical impact force = [(height {in.} x 3.19) + (mass {lb.} x 6.09)] - 105.37. The model is highly accurate, as evidenced by the high multiple R (R = 0.98) and low standard error of estimate (SEE) (37.4 N; 8.409 Ib.). Recommendations are made to employ MB training loads of approximately 30% of 1 repetition maximum of biomechanically comparable weight-training exercise.","Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; No Michigan Univ, US Olymp Educ Ctr, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; No Michigan Univ, Dept Hlth Phys Educ & Recreat, Marquette, MI 49855 USA","Ebben, WP (reprint author), Marquette Univ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",,,,,,,13,10,10,0,3,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1064-8011,,,J STRENGTH COND RES,J.

Methods: A prerequisite for guided tissue regeneration is the availability of materials with suitable physicochemical and bio-compatibility properties for the preparation of the devices. We investigated bone and peripheral nerve guided tissue regeneration, making two conduits from poly[L-lactide-co-6-caprolactone] (PLLC - peripheral nerve) and with poly [DL-lactide] (PDLLA - bone) with different features. After the polymer synthesis and chemical characterization, the conduits were evaluated in vivo in rat sciatic nerve gaps and in rabbit radius defects, Results: The results demonstrated good biocompatibility of both polymeric conduits, A good axonal regeneration and the restoration of the nerve trunk continuity, similar to that observed with autologous grafts has been obtained with PLLC conduits, that slowly degrade in about 6 months, PDLLA conduits protected the bone defect against the invasion of surrounding soft tissues; an effective bone growth bridging the defect was observed in their lumen. Conclusion: These results confirm the versatility of polylactides as biomaterials and will encourage further investigations on hard and soft tissues.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Giardino, R (reprint author), Codivilla Putti IOR Res Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,30,23,26,0,7,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1079-6061,,,J TRAUMA,J.

Bone is thereby formed without exogenous bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), well-characterized inducers of bone formation. Monolithic discs of sintered hydroxyapatite, fabricated with concavities of 800 and 1600 mu m diameter on both planar surfaces, were implanted in the rectus abdominis of the baboon (Papio ursinus). Histology on days 30 and 90 revealed de novo generation of bone exclusively within the concavities of the substratum. Porous hydroxyapatites were subsequently fabricated by impregnating polyurethane foams with slurry preparations of powdered hydroxyapatite, so that porous spaces formed by the coalescence of repetitive sequences of concavities. Artefacts were sintered in rod and disc configurations for implantation in heterotopic intramuscular sites and orthotopic calvarial sites, respectively. In four specimens, bone had formed in concavities of the substratum 30 days after implantation in the rectus abdominis. On day 90, bone morphogenesis with associated marrow had occurred in 33 specimens (41 %). Calvarial specimens showed substantial bone formation, culminating in complete penetration of bone within the porous spaces. On day 30, the immunolocalization of BMP family members (BMP-3 and OP-1/BMP-7) in cellular material at the hydroxyapatite interface suggests that the sintered ceramic may act as a solid-state matrix for adsorption of endogenously produced BMPs. These experiments demonstrate intrinsic osteoinductivity by monolythic and porous sintered hydroxyapatites implanted in heterotopic sites of adult primates, and that the geometry of the substratum profoundly regulates the expression of the osteogenic phenotype. The incorporation of specific biological activities into biomaterials achieved by manipulating the geometry of the substratum, defined as geometric induction of bone formation, will help engineer morphometric responses for therapeutic osteogenesis in clinical contexts.","Univ Witwatersrand, Bone Res Unit, MRC, Sch Med, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa; CSIR, Div Mat Sci & Technol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Bone Res Unit, MRC, Sch Med, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",177ripa@chiron.wits.ac.za,"Rohlf, F/A-8710-2008",,,,,56,114,128,0,11,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Using cell cultures the changes of cell functions induced by artificial materials may be evaluated. In screening rests the effect of biomaterials on functions common to all cell types is investigated through both continuous lines and primary cultures. In supplementary tests the effect of biomaterials on specific functions is studied, employing cells of the same type of those which will be in contact with the device in vivo. Osteoblasts, either From primary culture or an established line, are used to study the interaction with materials for bone implants. We evaluated whether dental cements affect the replication cycle of osteoblast-like cells MG63. The S phase was inhibited by the cements with a phenolic group, even though to a different extent. Mononuclear cell cultures are used to investigate the immune response, which is important in the host reaction to implant. We investigated whether the chromium ions released in a biological fluid may induce PBMC to produce cytokines involved in bone resorption. Chromium extract did not impair TNF alpha release significantly, but inhibited IL-6 release significantly in stimulated PBMC. Endothelial cell cultures are useful to the evaluation of materials for vascular grafts. We studied the influence of some types of Dacron on endothelial functions. Collagen-coated Dacron decreased significantly the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F-1 alpha. Knitted Dacron caused a significant increase of tissue factor, a significant reduction in PECAM-1 and a significant increase in ELAM-1. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Before the shape memory testing, it was necessary to determine the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the slightly crosslinked polyacrylamide as well as the mechanical properties of the composites at temperatures above T-g of a crosslinked polyacrylamide. Afterwards, the shape memory of the composite material was tested by performing a set of simple experiments based on deformation and heating of test pieces, their subsequent cooling and deformation force removing, and their repeated heating or water swelling, during which the residual elongation was measured and calculated. The composite material shaped in this way resumes its original shape if it is again heated above T-g of the crosslinked polyacrylamide or allowed to swell in distilled water. There exists a limiting concentration of hydrogel phase (approx. 30 phr), which is limited by good dispersion and good contact of hydrogel particles within the silicone matrix, under which the shape memory does not occur, and above which it exists.","Inst Chem Technol, Dept Polymers, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic","Hron, P (reprint author), Inst Chem Technol, Dept Polymers, Technicka 5, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,10,9,9,0,5,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0003-3146,,,ANGEW MAKROMOL CHEM,Angew.

The basic formulation is derived from prior work by others, with additional levels of complexity added where appropriate. It is comprised of a series of convection-diffusion-reaction equations which simulate platelet-surface and platelet-platelet adhesion, platelet activation by a weighted linear combination of agonist concentrations, agonist release and synthesis by activated platelets, platelet-phospholipid-dependent thrombin generation, and thrombin inhibition by heparin. The model requires estimation of four parameters to fit it to experimental data: shear-dependent platelet diffusivity and resting and activated platelet-surface and platelet-platelet reaction rate constants. The model is formulated to simulate a wide range of biomaterials and complex flows. In this article we present the basic model and its properties; in Part II (Sorensen et al., Ann. Biomed.

These parameters are estimated for platelet deposition onto a collagen substrate for simple parallel-plate how of whole blood in both the presence and absence of thrombin. One set of experimental results is used as a benchmark for model-fitting purposes. The ""trained"" model is then validated by applying it to additional test cases from the literature for parallel-plate Poiseuille flow over collagen at both higher and lower wall shear rates, and in the presence of various anticoagulants. The predicted values agree very well with the experimental results for the training cases, and good reproduction of deposition trends and magnitudes is obtained for the heparin, but not the citrate, validation cases.

Morphologic changes of cells that were contacted biomaterials or biomaterial extracts indicate their toxicity. However, information on cytotoxic effects is still obtained by subjective visual inspection of microscopic samples. In this article, a novel computer assisted method is introduced. The automatic analysis of digitized micrographs is achieved in several stages: segmentation, separation, classification, and measurement The segmentation of the image is provided by a new local adaptive thresholding technique, which adapts the threshold window sizes onto local gray level distribution and yields optimal window sizes. The actual threshold is obtained by maximizing interclass variances and minimizing intraclass variance. For the separation of connected cells, the binarized samples are cleaned from ""false"" markers by morphologic filtering. The subsequent separation is a two phase approach. Information levels are generated top-down by successively applying an enhanced erosion operator, which yields markers and filters noise usually evolving from multiple erosions. The converse bottom-up integration of the eroded markers is performed by successively applying an enhanced dilation operator, which reconstructs the cells and prevents merging of already separated objects. The subsequent measuring provides quantitative parameters of the distribution of size and compactness of the cells contained within the sample. The method was evaluated by L-929 fibroblasts that were in contact with 0%, 5%, and 10% concentrations of ethanol. For each concentration, 268 images of the cell populations were captured. The obtained quantitative parameters are highly correlated to the common verbal description of morphologic changes. Therefore, the proposed automatic method has several advantages compared with subjective examinations. The re suits allow an objective comparison of the quantification of phenomena; the subjective influence of the observer is eliminated; and the laboratory staff is relieved of time consuming routine work.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Med Informat, D-5100 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Physiol, D-5100 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res Biomat, D-5100 Aachen, Germany","Metzler, V (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, TZL, Inst Signalverarbeitung & Proze, Seelandstr 1A, D-23569 Lubeck, Germany.",,,,,,,27,17,28,0,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-AUG,1999.0,45,4,,,,,264,271,,10.1097/00002480-199907000-00004,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,220RQ,WOS:000081681600004,10445730.0,,,,2019-02-25

The system possesses a computerized user interface for controlling a linear displacement pulsatile pump in a controlled flow loop format to emulate in vivo cardiovascular characteristics. Evaluation of the pump system consisted of comparing its aortic pressure and flow profiles with in vivo rhesus hemodynamic waveforms in the time and frequency domains. Comparison of aortic pressure and flow data between the pump system and in vivo data showed good agreement in the time and frequency domains, however, the pump system produced a larger pulse pressure.

The new lipids were shown to be at least equivalent to MePEGA-2000-DSPE in assays designed to evaluate the effectiveness of polymers as steric barrier molecules in liposomes. Liposomes containing 1-5% of ATTA8-DSPE (octamer) showed comparable long circulation behavior relative to PEG-2000-DSPE analogues. Surprisingly, the shorter ATTA4-DSPE (tetramer) appeared to be quite effective in reducing clearance. Liver enzyme levels and systemic single dose tolerability of ATTA8-DSPE liposomes were comparable to controls, suggesting that the new materials are nontoxic. Prolonged exposure of ATTA8-DSPE liposomes to splenocytes in vitro showed no evidence of mitogenicity relative to controls or MePEGA-2000-DSPE liposomes. ATTA8-DSPE was as effective as MePEGC-2000-DSPE in preventing complement activation by cationic liposome systems. Repeat dosage in vivo regimes in ICR mice using DSPC/cholesterol liposomes, with and without 5% ATTA8-DSPE and MePEGC-2000-DSPE, showed no evidence of enhanced clearance on successive doses. Splenocytes recovered after repeat doses showed no significant evidence of mitogenicity on restimulation with liposomes. Cellular differentiation and activation marker levels in splenocytes recovered after the fourth in vivo administration were at normal levels. These results suggest that ATTAn oligomers do not induce an immune response in isolation. It was demonstrated that ATTA8-DSPE could be used to replace PEG-lipids in the formulation of doxorubicin, plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides using a variety of formulation techniques.

Cells were cultured in the presence of Laddec(R) (a highly purified bovine xenograft) and Bio-Oss(R) (natural bone mineral). Optical microscopic observations showed that osteoblasts attached on the plastic culture dishes and formed close contact with biomaterial particles. By day 5, the osteoblasts formed a confluent monolayer. A cytozymatic method showed intense alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining around and between the substrate granules of the two materials. By day 14, inverted phase microscopic observations showed that osteoblasts formed bone nodules around and between substrate particles, In addition, at this time, the Von Kossa staining was positive. Using a conventional assay, ALP specific activity was higher in the presence of Laddec(R) than in the presence of Bio-Oss(R). A quantitative morphological method using image analysis showed that the proportion of mineralized bone formed around biomaterial particles in relation to total bone was increased with Laddec(R) (15% more than with Bio-Oss(R)). Ultrastructural observations by TEM showed the presence of an electron dense collagen-free layer at the biomaterial/bone interface and a collagenous matrix deposited at the periphery, indicating the bioactivity of the biomaterials. These results indicated that Laddec(R) increased the expression of ALP in osteoblast cultures and facilitated the formation of multiple cell layers, providing a culture environment suitable for mineralization.

The protein pattern of the conditioning film of implanted nonencrusted and encrusted urological stents was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot of the desorbed species. The results obtained highlighted different electrophoresis profiles between nonencrusted and encrusted stents. Western blot showed the ubiquitous presence of albumin, while Tamm-Horsfall Protein and al-microglobulin adsorption was limited to nonencrusted devices. By an in vitro dynamic model in which, artificial urine was flowed through the lumen of control and retrieved nonencrusted stents, we demonstrated that the organic layer remarkably enhanced crystal precipitation and aggregation events on the surface.

Infections constitute one serious complication which may lead to the removal of the implant. In contrast to infections around polymer implants, infections around skin-penetrating titanium implants anchored in the temporal bone are often cured by local treatment. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common etiological agents in infections related to polymers whereas Staphylococcus aureus is considered as the main pathogen in infections around metallic implants, Microbial adhesion is a prerequisite for an infection. In the present study, the cell surface of microbes isolated from the skin around skin-penetrating titanium implants, with and without signs of infection, was characterized with respect to expression of cell surface hydrophobicity and to binding of immobilized fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen type 1 which could mediate adhesion. Expression of protein binding was similar in strains isolated from the two groups. No strain expressed a hydrophobic cell surface as determined by two-phase separation, and we conclude that the microenvironment around a titanium implant promotes expression of a hydrophilic rather than a hydrophobic cell surface which in turn makes many infections around a titanium implant curable by local treatment.

Each type of microcapsules has a membrane of different composition. Using three kinds of monomers, N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), 4-(aminomethyl)styrene (AmSt), and N,N-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide (DMAPAA), one type of aqueous copolymer having primary and tertiary amino groups was obtained. By the polymerization of three kinds of monomers, DMAAm, AmSt, and 2-[(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium-chloride (METAC), another type of aqueous copolymer having primary and quaternary ammonium groups was also obtained. Two more types of copolymers were synthesized by copolymerization of alpha-acryloxy-omega-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (a-PEG) with the above two kinds of monomer mixture. These copolymers were polymerized with terephthaloyldichloride at the water/oil interface to prepare Pour types of microcapsules containing water, i.e., poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAA-co-AmSt-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAA-co-AmSt-co -PEG-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, poly (DMAAm-co-METAC-co-AmSt-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, and poly (DMAAm-co-METAC-co-AmSt-co-PEC-alt-tefephthalic acid) microcapsules, which will be abbreviated to MC 1, MC 2, MC 3, and MC 4, respectively. It has been predicted that the microcapsule membranes are hydrophilic and soft and have two-sublayer structures from electrophoretic mobility measurements and from the analysis of the data with Ohshima's electrokinetic theory for soft particles. The outer sublayers of MC 1 and MC 2 are negatively charged and those of MC 3 and 4 are slightly positively charged. Also, the surfaces of MC 1 and MC 2 are harder than those of MC 3 and 4. By PEGylation, the surface charge density in the membranes decreases and the surface becomes softer. It has been found that the membrane of red blood cells (RBC) is also soft and is composed of two-sublayers, the outer sublayer of which is negatively charged and the inner one is positively charged. The interaction of four types of microcapsules with RBC has been studied. It was found that microcapsules with soft surfaces (MC 3 and MC 4) do not interact with RBC, even though the microcapsule surfaces are positively charged and the surface of RBC is negatively charged. On the other hand, microcapsules with negatively charged but harder surfaces (MC 1) interact with RBC to introduce hemolysis. The membrane surface of MC 2, which is obtained by PEGylation of MC 1, becomes softer than that of MC 1 so that the interaction with RBC was weakly suppressed. From these, it was concluded that the dominant factor to control the interaction between synthetic polymer surfaces and biological cell surfaces is not the surface charges carried by the polymer surfaces but the softness of the polymer surfaces.

In this study, we present a detailed morphological and functional characterization of covalently side-bound dextran layers by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS). The surface chemistry was monitored step-by-step by ellipsometric characterization of the surface loading. Dextrans of various molecular masses (10-2000 kD) were immobilized leading to surface loadings between 3 and mm(-2). The refractive indices of the covalently attached dextran layers under atmospheric conditions (n(D) = 1.51) ng mm were very close to the refractive index of a spin-coated dextran layer (n(D) = 1.52) indicating dense and homogeneous coverage achieved by the coupling chemistry. Under buffer solution, refractive indices between 1.34 and 1.365 and thicknesses between 20 and 40 nm of these dextran layers were determined. A dextran concentration in the hydrated layers of 0.05-0.21 g cm(-3) was estimated from the refractive index. The density and the thickness of the hydrated layers increased with molecular mass of the dextran. Non-specific binding was strongly reduced by the dextran layers and decreased with increasing thickness and density of the layer. Specific antibody binding to haptens immobilized in the dextran layer lead to an increase of both the density and the thickness of the layers. Time resolved detection by RIfS indicated significant decrease of protein mobility in the dextran layer. From these results we conclude that the functional properties of dextran layers with respect to protein interactions are determined by their effective pore-size, which is controlled by the number of bonds, the surface loading and the concentration of charged groups in the polymer.

Despite the large number of experimental studies, there is a lack of fundamental information on SIS anisotropic mechanical behavior and how this behavior changes postimplantation. As a first step in our study of remodeling biomaterials, we performed biaxial mechanical testing to quantify the anisotropic mechanical behavior and used small-angle Light scattering (SALS) to quantify the gross fiber structure of fresh, unimplanted SIS. Structural results indicate that SIS displays primarily a single, continuous preferred fiber direction oriented parallel to the long axis of the intestine. Occasionally, two distinct fiber populations oriented at similar to+/-280 with respect to the longitudinal axis could be distinguished. Consistent with this structure, SIS exhibited a nonlinear, anisotropic mechanical response with higher stresses along the longitudinal axis. Further, the circumferential stress-strain response was strongly affected by the maximum longitudinal strain level, but the maximum circumferential strain level only weakly affected the longitudinal stress-strain response. This asymmetric mechanical coupling suggests strong mechanical interactions on a fiber level.

These materials have application as injectable cardiovascular implants;cytotoxicity due to leachable products, as well as inflammation caused by the biomaterial itself, may ultimately affect the biocompatibility of the implant. We utilized a 7-day in vitro cytotoxicity assay to quantify cell density and cellular proliferation in the presence of copolymer films. The copolymer films exhibited slight to moderate cytotoxicity toward cultured endothelial cells, showing 20-86% viability relative to controls. Cell viability increased with an increasing weight percent of PEG or, to a lesser extent, the molecular weight of PEG. In vivo biocompatibility was assessed using a cage implantation model over a 21-day time period. This system was used to characterize the local cellular and humoral inflammatory response in the surrounding exudate, as well as the size and density of macrophages adherent to the material itself. All copolymer formulations exhibited excellent biocompatibility relative to controls with no significant differences in total leukocyte count among the different formulations. The in vivo inflammatory reaction displayed normal wound healing over 21 days as shown by a progressive decrease in both leukocyte concentration and enzymatic activity. The surface coverage of the copolymer films remained relatively constant from 7 to 21 days; There were no cells larger than 0.003 mm(2),which was previously shown to be the threshold value for foreign-body giant cells.,These data suggest that P(PF-co-EG) hydrogels have potential for use as injectable biomaterials.

They are now accepted as a prime component of signal transduction. Because focal adhesions also play an important role in cell morphology and migration, it can be argued that their presence is indicative of healthy cells. This has been the reason for several research groups to conclude that biomaterials sustaining focal adhesion assembly are biocompatible. In this study we demonstrate that cells under cytotoxic stress may still be able to retain their focal adhesions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells at passage 2 were exposed to nickel and zinc ion solutions ranging from 1 to 0.01 mM for 4 and 24 h. Cells were seeded on fibronectin precoated glass slides or in tissue culture quality 96-well plates. MTT conversion with 1 and 0.5 mM nickel and zinc was strongly depressed, indicating that these concentrations are cytotoxic. Proliferative activity was also affected by these concentrations. Cells exposed to zinc typically retracted and detached from the surface, whereas cells exposed to nickel remained on the surface without signs of retraction. Nevertheless, cells exposed to nickel were impaired to reach con fluency, which was determined by cadherin-5 expression. All these data indicate that nickel ions at a sufficient concentration influence cells in a cytotoxic way. Despite this apparent cytotoxicity, focal adhesion distribution as visualized by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin was not affected. With zinc the morphological changes were accompanied by apparent fusion of focal adhesions during retraction and finally dissolution. These data indicate that the mere presence of focal adhesions does not allow a reliable statement about the functional status of a fell. On the other hand, when focal adhesions are affected it is an excellent monitor of disturbed cell function.

This is the first report on the observation of platelets adhered to opaque biomaterials in real time under shear flow conditions. The direct observation of platelet adhesion to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) as an opaque biomaterial revealed that the kinetics of platelet adhesion to ePTFE depended greatly on shear stresses, showing that the shear stress of 5.0 dyne/cm(2) induced higher adhesiveness of platelets to ePTFE than that of either 0.1 or 15 dyne/cm(2). The observation also showed a difference in platelet adhesiveness among ePTFEs with different fibril lengths-0, 3.2, 18, and 35 mu m-indicating that ePTFEs with shorter fibril length had lower adhesiveness of platelets under a shear stress of 5.0 dyne/cm(2). It is indispensable for analyzing the phenomena of platelet adhesion to opaque biomaterials to observe in real-time rolling, adhesion, and detachment of platelets under shear stresses without disturbing shear flow conditions. The results showed that the mechanical and optical design of the system could serve this purpose.

These substitutes lack the osteogenic and osteoinductive properties of bone autograft, A direct approach would be to stimulate osteogenesis in these biomaterials by the addition of fresh bone-marrow cells (BMC). We therefore created osteoperiosteal gaps 2 cm wide in the ulna of adult rabbits and either bridged them with coral alone (CC), coral supplemented with BMC, or left them empty, Coral was chosen as a scaffold because of its good biocompatibility and resorbability, In osteoperiosteal gaps bridged with coral only, the coral was invaded chiefly by fibrous tissue. It was insufficient to produce union after two months. In defects filled with coral and BMC an increase in osteogenesis was observed and the bone surface area was significantly higher compared with defects filled with coral alone. Bony union occurred in six out of six defects filled with coral and BMC after two months. An increase in the resorption of coral was also observed, suggesting that resorbing cells or their progenitors were present in bone marrow and survived the grafting procedure. Our findings have shown that supplementation of coral with BMC increased both the resorption of material and osteogenesis in defects of a clinical significance.","Univ D Diderot, Lab Rech Orthoped, UPRES A 7052, CNRS, F-75010 Paris, France","Petite, H (reprint author), Univ D Diderot, Lab Rech Orthoped, UPRES A 7052, CNRS, 10 Ave Verdun, F-75010 Paris, France.",,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060",,,,29,39,43,2,3,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND WC2N 6ET",0301-620X,,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

We constructed a closed loop in vitro heparinized whole human blood circulation model for testing hemocompatibility of coronary stents, This model allows evaluation of human blood activation by blood-stent interaction in a well-controlled setting, Until now these interactions were studied in the highly coagulable pig coronary artery model. Methods: We evaluated activation of the coagulation system and blood components by uncoated, heparin-coated, and silicon-carbide coated tantalum stents, The effects, measured by biochemical assays, were compared with stainless-steel stents, Also the inhibitory effect on platelet activation by indomethacin equal to the oral effect of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily, was measured and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Both activation of the coagulation system and platelets were counteracted by indomethacin, suggesting an important role for platelets in activation of the coagulation system in this model. Despite platelet activation by all stents, the SiC-coated tantalum stent demonstrates a significantly lower GpIIIa receptor-mediated platelet adhesion at the stent surface (21.7 X 10(3) counts per second/mg stent weight) compared to all other stents (stainless-steel 54.0, heparin-coated 95.7 and uncoated 76.2 X 10(3) cps/mg). Also activated leukocytes demonstrated a significantly loner CD11b receptor-mediated adhesion at the SiC-coated stent (37.0 X 10(3) cps/mg) than at the stainless-steel stent (114.5 X 10(3) cps/mg). Conclusions: Data from this in, vitro circulation study show a significantly lower platelet and leukocyte adhesion at the surface of the SiC-coated tantalum stent than at the surface of stainless-steel stents or uncoated and heparin-coated tantalum stents.","Univ Groningen Hosp, Thoraxctr, Dept Cardiol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; Med Ctr, Dept Cardiol, Alkmaar, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Groningen Hosp, Trial Coordinat Ctr, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands","Monnink, SHJ (reprint author), Univ Groningen Hosp, Thoraxctr, Dept Cardiol, POB 30-001, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,39,51,55,0,3,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",1081-5589,1708-8267,,J INVEST MED,J.

Only ultra-high surface area HAp powder, prepared by the metathesis method (10Ca(NO3)(2) + 6(NH4)(2)HPO4 + 8NH(4)OH), could produce dense coatings when sintered at 875-1000 degrees C. Single EPD coatings cracked during sintering owing to the 15-18% sintering shrinkage, but the HAp did not decompose. The use of dual coatings (coat, sinter, coat, sinter) resolved the cracking problem. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) inspection revealed that the second coating filled in the ""valleys"" in the cracks of the first coating. The interfacial shear strength of the dual coatings was found, by ASTM F1044-87, to be similar to 12 MPa on a titanium substrate and similar to 22 MPa on 316L stainless steel, comparing quite favorably with the 34 MPa benchmark (the shear strength of bovine cortical bone was found to be 34 MPa). Stainless steel gave the better result since alpha-316L (20.5 mu m mK(-1)) > alpha-HAp (similar to 14 mu m mK(-1)), resulting in residual compressive stresses in the coating, whereas alpha-titanium (similar to 10.3 mu m mK(-1)) < alpha-HAp, resulting in residual tensile stresses in the coating.

We investigated the possibility of using a modified cellulosic membrane for continuous therapies, assessing the hydraulic characteristics and clearance performances of high-flux cellulose triacetate hemodiafilter (0.7 m(2)) in vitro and in vivo. The flowdynamic characteristics of the filter suggest its optimal use in veno-venous pump-drive techniques. Efficiency was excellent, with urea daily clearances as high as 50 liters or more. The high permeability and porosity of the membrane also increased the clearances of larger solutes such as creatinine and inulin.

Many studies have show that various growth factors enhance wound healing in animal models. However, growth factors are expensive and complex and their wound pharmacokinetics are unknown. The cinical trials with growth factors in the treatment of chronic wounds have produced unsuccessful results. A viable alternative to growth factors may be certain biomaterials such as hydrophilic, carbohydrate beads. Materials and Methods. Positively charged, negatively charged, or uncharged beads were applied to paired 6-cm rat incisions. The following key aspects of the wound healing process were examined: wound breaking strength and histological analysis. Results. Our data show that wounds treated with positively charged, DEAE Sephadez beads had a 46-50% (P < 0.001) increase in breaking strength over untreated control wounds. A variety of other positively charged, anion exchange materials also elicited a wound healing response, despite the fact that the positively charged chemical moieties as well as the bead matrix were different, hi conjunction with the increase in wound breaking strength, an increase in wound macrophage was observed in wounds treated with anion exchangers (P < 0.01). Negatively charged or uncharged beads showed no significant difference from the untreated controls. Conclusion. We conclude from this study that the enhancement of wound healing seen with positively charged beads is due principally to the positive charge on the beads; we postulate that the anion exchange between the positively charged beads and tissue is responsible for this enhancement.

Experimental results illustrated that the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid phase greatly influenced on the in-plane deformation condition of the solid phase. Consequently, as for the solid-fluid composite models, the compressive load dispersion by the solid-fluid phase interaction was expected.","Doshisha Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 6100321, Japan; Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd, Hydraul Excavator Dev Ctr, Akashi, Hyogo 6748686, Japan","Katayama, T (reprint author), Doshisha Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 6100321, Japan.",,,,,,,15,3,3,0,1,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"SHINANOMACHI-RENGAKAN BLDG, SHINANOMACHI 35, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 160, JAPAN",1340-8046,,,JSME INT J A-SOLID M,JSME Int.

Methods: Viscoelastic shear properties of various implantable biomaterials (Teflon, gelatin, collagen, fat, hyaluronic acid, and hyaluronic acid with fibronectin) were measured with a parallel-plate rotational rheometer, Elastic and viscous shear properties were quantified as a function of oscillation frequency (0.01-15 Hz) at 37 degrees C. Results: The shear properties of hyaluronic acid were relatively close to those of human vocal fold mucosal tissues reported previously. Hyaluronic acid at specific concentrations (0.5%-1%), with or without fibronectin, was found to exhibit viscous shear properties (viscous shear modulus and dynamic viscosity) similar to those of the average male and female vocal fold mucosa. Conclusions: According to a theory that establishes the effects of tissue shear properties on, vocal fold oscillation, phonation threshold pressure (a measure of the ease of phonation) is directly related to the viscous shear modulus of the vibrating vocal fold mucosa. Therefore, our findings suggest that hyaluronic acid, either by itself or mixed with fibronectin, may be a potentially optimal bioimplant for the surgical management of vocal fold mucosal defects and lamina propria deficiencies (e.g., scarring) from a biomechanical standpoint.","Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Denver Ctr Performing Arts, Wilbur James Gould Voice Res Ctr, Denver, CO USA","Chan, RW (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, 330 WJSHC, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",roger-chan@uiowa.edu,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [P60 DC00976],,,39,82,85,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-852X,1531-4995,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,JUL,1999.0,109,7,1,,,,1142,1149,,10.1097/00005537-199907000-00026,,,,8,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,212YC,WOS:000081244400026,10401858.0,,,,2019-02-25

Various biomaterials are used for reconstruction of the anophthalmic orbit, often with unsatisfactory long-term results. Implants have been placed between the periorbital and the orbital floor. The authors describe a new material composed of hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP) in the form of ceramic blocks, to be placed into the orbital fat as a new surgical site. Methods: Ten patients with PESS underwent surgery to compensate the volume deficit of the anophthalmic orbit. Blocks of HA-TCP were created by fragmentation of a larger piece, tailored as needed, and implanted in the orbital fat. The patients were monitored regularly with clinical and radiologic examinations to evaluate the behavior of the implants. Results: The volume of the HA-TCP was measured in 5 cases (mean, 2.95 +/- 1.08 ml). A significant reduction of enophthalmos was obtained: mean Hertel exophthalmometry measured 12.7 +/- 2.5 mm preoperatively and 14 +/- 2.4 mm postoperatively (P < 0.05). The average prosthesis volume was significantly reduced in the cases measured: 2.7 ml +/- 0.94 ml preoperatively and 1.8 +/- 0.7 ml postoperatively (p < 0.02). There was a negative correlation between the HA-TCP implant volume and postoperative prosthesis volume (correlation coefficient = -0.925; p < 0.05). According to photographic evaluation, correction of the enophthalmos and of the superior sulcus depression were obtained in 70% and 90% of cases, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging seems to demonstrate that the blocks become well integrated into the surrounding orbital tissue. Conclusion: The HA-TCP blocks correct some anomalies of PESS. Placement of the blocks directly into the orbital fat is a promising alternative to the traditional subperiosteal location.","Ctr Hosp Univ Dupuytren, Dept Ophthalmol, Limoges, France","Adenis, JP (reprint author), CHRU Dupuytren, Serv Ophtalmol, 2 Ave Martin Luther King, F-87042 Limoges, France.",,"ROBERT, Pierre-Yves/O-8597-2016",,,,,26,14,16,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0740-9303,,,OPHTHALMIC PLAST REC,Ophthalmic Plast.

The mechanism for this is unknown. During the initial phase of bone implantation the biomaterial comes into direct contact with whole blood. In this study we use a newly developed in vitro chamber model to compare different commonly used biomaterials in contact with whole blood. These materials were selected with respect to their different osteointegrating properties in order to correlate these properties with the response to whole blood. In the presence of 3 IU/ml of heparin only titanium induced macroscopic clotting. This was reflected by the generation of thrombin-antithrombin which was much increased in blood in contact with titanium compared with steel and PVC. The coagulation activation caused by titanium was triggered by the intrinsic pathway because the generation of FXIIa-AT/C1 esterase inhibitor paralleled that of thrombin-antithrombin, and both thrombin-antithrombin complex and FXIIa-AT/C1 esterase inhibitor generation were abrogated by corn trypsin inhibitor, which is a specific inhibitor of FXIIa. The binding of platelets was increased on the titanium surface compared to the other biomaterial surfaces and the state of platelet activation was much more pronounced as reflected by the levels of beta-thromboglobulin and PDGF. This study indicates that titanium is unsuitable as a biomaterial in devices which are in direct contact with blood for a prolonged period. Furthermore, PDGF and other alpha-granule proteins e. g. TGF-beta, are known to be potent promoters of osteogenesis which suggests that the pronounced thrombogenic properties of titanium might contribute to the good osteointegrating properties.","Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Mat Sci, Angstrom Lab, Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Kalmar, Dept Nat Sci, Kalmar, Sweden","Nilsson, B (reprint author), Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012; Andersson, Joakim/A-3017-2009; Nilsson Ekdahl, Kristina/B-5301-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730; Andersson, Joakim/0000-0003-2991-1927; ",,,,42,129,132,0,6,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-6245,2567-689X,,THROMB HAEMOSTASIS,Thromb.

These changes have been shown to be dependent on the biomaterials, techniques, and devices used. In this study the influence of a new cell separator (AMICUS) and storage container (PL-2410) on platelet glycoproteins was analyzed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During plateletpheresis and storage, the levels of platelet glycoproteins and binding of fibrinogen were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: During apheresis, mean channel fluorescence intensity of GD41a did not change significantly (p = 0.06). A small increase was evident in CD42b mean channel fluorescence intensity, which rose from a baseline level of 178.6 +/- 68.3 to 231.5 +/- 97.9 at the end of the procedure (p<0.05); in CD62p-positive platelets, which increased from 2.0 +/- 0.9 percent to 9.9 +/- 3.9 percent (p<0.05); in CD63-positive platelets, which increased from 1.7 +/- 0.7 percent to 7.9 +/- 2.6 percent (p<0.05); and in the binding of fibrinogen, which increased from 1.9 +/- 0.8 percent positive platelets to 10.5 +/- 2.6 percent (p<0.05). During storage, the mean channel fluorescence intensity of CD41a and C-D42b, the percentage of CD62p- and GD63-positive platelets, and the binding of fibrinogen to platelets showed no significant change. CONCLUSION: These studies show that alterations in platelet antigens and platelet activation occur to a small degree during apheresis and storage. These findings demonstrate generally good biocompatibility of this new cell separator.","Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Transfus Med Transplantat Immunol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Hemostaseol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; Baxter Res & Dev Europe, Nivelles, Belgium","Gutensohn, K (reprint author), Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Transfus Med Transplantat Immunol, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,45,6,7,0,1,AMER ASSOC BLOOD BANKS,BETHESDA,"8101 GLENBROOK RD, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2749 USA",0041-1132,,,TRANSFUSION,Transfusion,JUL,1999.0,39,7,,,,,742,747,,10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39070742.x,,,,6,Hematology,Hematology,216EK,WOS:000081428100012,10413282.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the control group the defect was closed primarily. PP, PG, and DM meshes were used to repair the defects such that the intestines were in contact with the mesh in the remaining three groups. BT was evaluated 4, 24, and 48 hours later. At 4 hours total BT increased in the PP group compared with that in the control (p = 0.0321) and DM (p = 0.0098) groups. At 24 hours the PG group had increased BT compared with the controls (p = 0.0392) and the DM group (p = 0.0274), whereas the PP group had increased BT compared with the DM group only (p = 0.0477).

These structures are primarily adapted to the variety of mechanical functions that bone fulfills. Here we review the structure-mechanical relations of one bone structural type, lamellar bone. This is the most abundant type in many mammals, including humans. A lamellar unit is composed of five sublayers. Each sublayer is an array of aligned mineralized collagen fibrils. The orientations of these arrays differ in each sublayer with respect to both collagen fibril axes and crystal layers, such that a complex rotated plywood-like structure is formed. Specific functions for lamellar bone, as opposed to the other bone types, could not be identified. It is therefore proposed that the lamellar structure is multifunctional-the ""concrete"" of the bone family of materials. Experimentally measured mechanical properties of lamellar bone demonstrate a clear-cut anisotropy with respect to the axis direction of long bones. A comparison of the elastic and ultimate properties of parallel arrays of lamellar units formed in primary bone with cylindrically shaped osteonal structures in secondary formed bone shows that most of the intrinsic mechanical properties are built into the lamellar structure. The major advantages of osteonal bone are its fracture properties. Mathematical modeling of the elastic properties based on the lamellar structure and using a rule-of-mixtures approach can closely simulate the measured mechanical properties, providing greater insight into the structure-mechanical relations of lamellar bone. a 1999 Academic Press.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mat & Interfaces, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Weiner, S (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DEO6954],,,56,379,392,3,136,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1047-8477,,,J STRUCT BIOL,J.

Peptide bond cleavage of the modified inteins generated an N-terminal cysteine and a C-terminal thioester on the same protein, These complementary reactive groups underwent intra- or intermolecular condensation to generate circular or polymeric protein species with a new peptide bond at the site of ligation, Three cyclic peptides, BBP, an organ specific localization peptide; RGD, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation; and CDR-H3/C2, which inhibits HIV-1 replication, were isolated using the two-intein system. BBP, RGD, and CDR-H3/C2 had masses of 977.1, 1119.9, and 2098.6 g/mol, respectively, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry, which agreed well with the values of 977.2, 1120.3, and 2098.3 g/mol, respectively, predicted for the cyclic species. This system was used to cyclize proteins as large as 395 amino acids. Furthermore, multimers of thioredoxin were formed upon concentration of the reactive species, indicating the potential to form novel biomaterials based on fibrous proteins.","New England Biolabs Inc, Beverly, MA 01915 USA","Xu, MQ (reprint author), New England Biolabs Inc, 32 Tozer Rd, Beverly, MA 01915 USA.",,,,,,,28,110,117,0,11,AMER SOC BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY INC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0021-9258,,,J BIOL CHEM,J.

Our study is aimed at developing technology designed to alter the outer atomic layers of a material to give the desired compatibility with the tissue while retaining the properties of the bulk substratum. Materials used in this study were titanium vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) and cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy (Co-Cr). Soda Lime glass discs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) acted as controls. A cathode of either Ti-6Al-4V or Co-Cr was used to simultaneously deposit and implant identified substrata. The attachment of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) to various materials was determined using radiolabeling or colorimetric assays. Results show that HBDC adhere preferentially to the unmodified surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-4V on glass compared to the unmodified Co-Cr surfaces and to that of the Co-Cr on glass. Depositing Ti-6Al-4V on Co-Cr gives significantly better attachment of HBDC than when depositing Co-Cr onto Ti-6Al-4V. While cellular attachment to the created surfaces reflects that of the cathodic materials, it is not identical to these materials. Ion deposition/implantation is capable of creating permanent surfaces which reflect the adhesion of source materials not bulk substrata.

Histiocytes were markedly accumulated around the particles of UHMWPE (11 mu m), Co-Cr (3.9 mu m), SUS316L (3.9 mu m), Co-Cr (0.03 mu m), and titanium alloy (0.03 mu m). Around the UHMWPE particles (99 mu m), a slight histiocytic reaction and bone formation were observed. Particles of alumina ceramics (3.9 mu m) and titanium alloy (3.5 mu m) which were in phagocytosable sizes also had few histiocytic reactions. Statistically, the material difference was more strongly related to the histiocyte reaction than to the particle size and calculated total surface area of particles.

The toxicity of forms of the individual elements released from ASTM F75 Co-Cr-Mo (Co-Cr-Mo), F138 316L stainless steel (316L), and F136 Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-6Al-4V) was first determined, and a mathematical model was developed to predict the toxicity of mixtures of these ions. Aqueous metal solutions were then mixed according to the proportions of the ions found in these alloys, and their toxicity was measured with Microtox. Mixture behavior was classified as synergistic, antagonistic, or additive by comparing measured toxicity to predicted toxicity. Since relating these tests to actual implant corrosion processes can be con founded by selective leaching, the predicted and measured toxicity of aqueous metal solutions mixed according to proportions representative of selective leaching were next determined, and the mixture behaviors were classified as before. The most toxic individual alloying elements were found to be hexavalent Cr, Ni, and Co, in that order: a finding in accord with prior biocompatibility research. Co-Cr-Mo was found to be the most toxic alloy mixture of both those combined according to alloy composition and those combined to reflect selective leaching. The Ti-6Al-4V mixtures were found to behave synergistically, while the Co-Cr-Mo and 316L mixtures behaved antagonistically. By providing insight into degradation product toxicity and elemental interaction, these experiments demonstrate the utility of employing bioluminescent bacterial assays to investigate biocompatibility of implant materials. Further studies to more closely simulate in vivo conditions, though, are required to fully gauge their potential in this regard.

The difference of the binding behavior of protein with that of the immobilized metal ions is also discussed. For the immobilized Fe(III), ITC results show that the adsorption enthalpy at a constant pH value decreased as the NaCl concentration increased and also decreased with the pH values at constant NaCl concentrations. The adsorption enthalpy become negative under higher pH values or higher salt concentrations indicating the adsorption process is partly driven by the enthalpy. The enthalpy of lysozyme with Fe(III) is higher than that with Cu(II) implying that the heat required for the dehydration of Cu(II) is lower than for the dehydration of Fe(III) and/or that the heat generated from the formation of the coordination with Cu(II) is higher than with Fe(III). In addition, the comparison of different immobilized metal ions corresponding to the equilibrium binding affinity suggests that the binding force of lysozyme with Cu(II) is higher than with Fe(III). This study presents the chemical differences between the binding affinity and the adsorption enthalpy of lysozyme interacting with the immobilized metal ions. The binding and thermodynamic data presented in this study elucidate the mechanism and process of lysozyme binding with immobilized metal ions. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristic functions provide valuable information enabling a more thorough understanding of protein adsorption at the immobilized metal ion affinity surface.

Resorption of the ceramic coatings has raised some concern about the behavior of the bone-implant interfaces after the coating disappearance. Substitution of the OH- ions by fluoride in the hydroxylapatite (HA) lattice makes the calcium phosphate more stable. We investigated the degradation rate of dental implants with 50- and 100-mu m coatings of HA, fluorapatite (FA), or fluorhydroxylapatite (FHA), The implants were inserted in dog jaws and retrieved for histological analysis after 3, 6, and 12 months. The thickness of the calcium phosphate coatings was evaluated using an image analysis device. A relative resorption index and its standard deviation were studied. HA and FA coatings (even at 100-mu m thickness) were almost totally degraded within the implantation period. In contrast, the FHA coatings did not show significant degradation during the same period. The standard deviation showed that the resorption process for FHA with thicknesses of 50 or 100 mu m was the same, Such a difference was not observed between the 50- and 100-mu m thick coatings of FA and HA.

They contain various resins that improve their mechanical properties. These modifications, however, may also affect their biocompatibility, We compared the cytotoxicity of seven biomaterials (five RM-GICs, one metal-reinforced GIC (M-GIC), and a zinc-oxyphosphate cement) using an assay of pulp cell viability in vitro (MTT assay). The most toxic materials appeared to be the M-GIC Hi-Dense and the RM-GIC Vitremer, The less toxic ones appeared to be the RM-GICs Compoglass and Photac-Fil, Attempts made to identify the factors responsible for their cytotoxicity indicated that in vitro cytotoxicity did not seem to be caused by any change in pH of the biomaterial eluates. Adsorption of biomaterial eluates on dentin powder significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of all biomaterials. The concentration of F-, Sr2+, and Al3+ (major ionic elements present in GICs) in the eluate of six glass ionomer containing biomaterials was too low to be cytotoxic, However, Cu2+ and Ag+ (present in alloys of M-GIC) were present in toxic concentrations in Hi-Dense eluates, Unpolymerized monomers leached from resins were identified by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy in biomaterial eluates, The monomers hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), and poly(acrylic) acid were identified in eluates of Vitremer, Compoglass, and Hi-Dense, respectively, After ethanol elution of HEMA and TEGDMA from Vitremer and Compoglass, respectively, the cytotoxicity of these two RM-GICs was drastically reduced.

Six different CFRCs of constant pore size (about 30 mu m) were fabricated that had 9, 12, and 17% porosity with 2-nm(3) matrix crystallites and 6, 12, and 20% at 25 nm(3). They were implanted as femoral transverse diaphyseal pins that were 1.5 mm in diameter. At 5 and 45 weeks, implant and bone histologic specimens were evaluated histologically and by a scanning electron microscope and an electron microprobe, Also, regional lymph nodes and spleens were examined. By 45 weeks, direct implant-bone contact was observed over most of the interface in most specimens, At the implant surface, there was partial replacement of CFRC with host tissue. However, the microprobe showed that the implant-bone interface was chemically abrupt with no cross-diffusion of ionic species. Besides the surface effects, there was partial filling of the implant pores with tissue, including bone organized de novo deep within, This was observed histologically and confirmed by microprobe. Lymph nodes and spleens were histologically normal, and no carbon particles were found. None of the results were influenced by porosity or matrix crystallite size over the ranges studied. In summary, these porous CFRCs are partially degraded when in contact with bone and appear substantially tissue compatible. They may be useful as scaffolds for regrowth of bone.

The swelling behavior of the hydrogels in water, alkaline, and acidic media showed a slight decrease in the equilibrium water content with the content of V in the copolymer although in all cases it was superior to an EWC > 20%. The diffusion mechanism followed a Fickian behavior in all media. The values of the diffusion coefficients were in the range 2.5-1.6 10(-7) cm(2)/s. The states of water in the hydrogels were determined by DSC. A decrease in the content of freezing water was obtained with the V content for all media, and for all compositions lower values of freezing water were obtained in acidic or basic pHs than in distilled water. The copolymeric xerogels, analyzed by contact angle measurements, deviated from those expected taking into consideration those of the homopolymers and the average fraction of the monomers in the copolymer. The polar contribution dropped with the introduction of a small content (4 wt %) of the vitamin E-containing monomer, and it reached a value similar to that of poly-V for a composition of 49 wt % of V in the copolymer. This behavior is accounted for by the segregation of the macromolecular chains of both kinds of monomers, due mainly to differences in their polarity, molecular weights, and the reactivity of both monomers. Finally, thermogravimetric analysis showed a higher thermal (antioxidant) stability of the poly-V with respect to poly-H, giving rise to a residue of 18 wt %. The V-containing copolymers also showed an improved stability (antioxidant behavior), indicating the possibility of the V unit's interfering with the oxidative process, based on free-radical species, and, therefore, with the aging process at the cellular level.

As the principal formed element in a thrombus, platelets play a major role in determining the hemocompatibility of mechanical heart valves and other high-shear-rate cardiovascular devices. Since larger animals are required to test many such devices, sheep and porcine platelet responses were compared to humans. Adhesion, spreading, and the formation of thrombilike structures were examined in vitro on pyrolytic carbon mechanical heart valve leaflets, National Institutes of Health-reference polyethylene and silicone rubber, and Formvar. Principal findings were that platelet responses are strongly dependent upon the biomaterial and the species: Porcine and human platelets spread extensively on pyrolytic carbon, formed thrombuslike structures on Formvar, and were least active on silicone rubber. Human and porcine platelets responded differently to polyethylene: Human platelets spread extensively, while porcine platelets remained pseudopodial. In contrast sheep platelets attached much less, never reached fully spread shapes, and were far less active overall. Since porcine responses were generally similar to humans, pigs may be a useful predictor of in vivo platelet-biomaterial interaction in humans. Conversely, as ovine platelets were much less active, this must be accounted for in the evaluation of cardiovascular devices tested in sheep.

We hypothesized that potential for S. aureus to cause an ocular infection would be enhanced if these bacteria are able to adhere to the biomaterials used in contact lenses. In turn, bacterial adhesion could also be influenced by other factors, such as properties of contact lenses and the absorbance of some tear components. We investigated the effect of the tear protein lysozyme on S. aureus adhesion to contact lenses and its effect on production of toxins or enzymes. Methods: Bacterial adhesion on contact lenses was determined by counting the total number of bacteria as well as viable bacteria on iysozyme-coated or non-coated lenses, and by counting bacteria grown in the presence or absence of lysozyme in the medium. Toxin and enzyme production was assessed by haemolysis and proteolysis assays. Results: Our results indicate that adhesion was significantly increased in the presence of lysozyme, both in the medium and coated onto contact lenses (P = 0.04). The presence of lysozyme did not alter the production of alpha- or beta- toxins. However; the presence of lysozyme inhibited elastase activity. Conclusion: These results indicate that lysozyme deposition on contact lenses promoted S. aureus adhesion. The tear protein lysozyme might modify elastase activity and thus modulate the production of corneal degradation resulting from the action of this enzyme.","Univ New S Wales, Cornea & Contact Lens Res Unit, Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Thakur, A (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Cornea & Contact Lens Res Unit, Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,,"willcox, mark/0000-0003-3842-7563",,,,21,20,21,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0814-9763,,,AUST NZ J OPHTHALMOL,Aust.

The resulting matrix is a three-dimensional scaffold consisting of interconnected pores with an average size of 40 mu m and a high pore volume/surface area ratio. The covalent nature of the bond between the collagen fibers and the modified hyaluronate was demonstrated by extended elution with phosphate buffered saline and by extraction in increasing ionic gradients. The fraction of covalently bound hyaluronate in the matrix ranged from 5 to 25 w%. The total hyaluronate content of the COL/HA matrix affected both the in vitro non-enzymatic and enzymatic degradation as well as the in vivo turnover. When implanted in cranial defects in rats, the COL/HA matrix demonstrated good biocompatibility and exhibited greater osteoconductive potential than matrices composed of either cross-linked collagen or cross-linked hyaluronate alone.

Because the fibrinogen bound to them is functional in the classic sense of fibrin gelation, the coated microparticles may have potential as vehicles for the targeted delivery of various molecules to sites of fibrin(ogen) deposition in vivo. So that we could assess directly this potential, we first established a method for eliciting reproducibly a focal, fibrin(ogen)-rich, inflammatory lesion in a hind footpad of mice. We then monitored the tissue distribution of fibrinogen-coated microparticles following their injection into the tail vein of mice bearing this well-defined lesion. As happens with most microparticles following their intravenous administration, liposomes and oil droplets, whether coated with fibrinogen or not, accumulate rapidly in the liver and spleen of treated animals, Indeed, in the case of oil droplets, accumulation of fibrinogen-coated microparticles in those organs and in the lungs is even greater than that of fibrinogen-free microparticles, However, as distinct from fibrinogen-free liposomes and oil droplets, fibrinogen-coated microparticles also accumulate in the inflamed hind footpad. We conclude that fibrinogen-coated liposomes and oil droplets do have potential as vehicles for delivering molecules to sites of fibrin(ogen) deposition in vivo.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA","DeAnglis, AP (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",,,,,,,49,6,6,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-4513,1470-8744,,BIOTECHNOL APPL BIOC,Biotechnol.

Methods Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation was conducted by one surgeon on 86 subjects (aged 50-89 years) with cataracts. Of these subjects, 67 completed the study. Subjects were implanted either with a foldable IOL (n = 38) or a rigid IOL (n = 29), Best corrected Snellen visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (2-28 cycles/degree) were measured approximately 2 months postoperatively. Comparisons were made between the pseudophakic groups and an additional group of 28 age-matched, normal subjects (aged 58-81 years). Non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U) as well as parametric (ANOVA and Pearson) statistics tests were used in the analysis of results. Results All pseudophakes had corrected visual acuity of 6/9 or better. There were no significant differences in visual acuity (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.61) or contrast sensitivity (ANOVA, p = 0.33) between the three groups. The mean residual refractive error of the foldable IOL group was hypermetropic in comparison with the rigid IOL group but not significant at the 99% level of probability (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in astigmatism between the groups. Conclusions Implanting a foldable acrylic IOL gave no post-operative benefit in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity to pseudophakes over a less expensive rigid PMMA IOL, within this post-operative period. This study did not provide a comparison between the two lenses regarding post-operative complications, in particular the important long-term complication of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Until and if any particular advantage of a given IOL in reduced incidence of PCO is confirmed, it appears more economical to implant the conventional rigid PMMA IOL using small-incision surgery.","Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Vis Sci, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Birmingham, Acad Unit Ophthalmol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; So Gen Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Glasgow G51 4TF, Lanark, Scotland","Afsar, AJ (reprint author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Vis Sci, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,27,18,18,1,4,ROYAL COLL OPHTHALMOLOGISTS,LONDON,"17 CORNWALL TERRACE, LONDON NW1 4QW, ENGLAND",0950-222X,,,EYE,Eye,JUN,1999.0,13,,3A,,,,329,335,,,,,,7,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,215GV,WOS:000081374300009,10624427.0,,,,2019-02-25

Indeed, such polymers, which can be synthesized through different chemical and biological routes, have cleavable ester beads in their backbone for hydrolytic degradation, stereogenic centres in the monomers units for controlling the macromolecular structure, bioassimilable or non-toxic repeating units and lateral chemical functions which can be adapted to specific requirements. The strategy for building such complex architectures, with one or several specific pendant groups, is based on the anionic ring-opening polymerization or copolymerization of the large family of malolactonic and 3-alkylmalolactonic acid esters. Because we are able to control the monomer synthesis and the polymerization step, we have been able to prepare different degradable materials for the biomedical field; such as: degradable associating networks made up by the association of random copolyesters containing a small percentage of hydrophobic moieties and beta-cyclodextrin copolymers; degradable macromolecular micelles constituted by degradable amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(beta-malic acid) as hydrophilic segments and poly(beta-alkylmalic acid alkyl esters) as hydrophobic blocks; and degradable nanoparticles made up by hydrophobic poly(beta-malic acid alkyl esters) derivatives. We have also prepared a terpolymer which exhibits growth factor-like properties in vivo. Finally, poly-(beta-malic acid) has been used as an additive in the preparation of peritoneal dialysis bags.

A finite element analysis was used to determine the stress distribution along the cavo-surface margin which results from occlusal loading of each restoration. The cyclic crack growth rate of sub-surface flaws located along the dentinal cavo-surface margin were determined utilizing the Paris law. Based on similarities in material properties and lack of fatigue property data for dental biomaterials, the cyclic fatigue crack growth parameters for engineering ceramics were used to approximate the crack growth behavior. It was found that flaws located within the dentine along the buccal and lingual margins can significantly reduce the fatigue life of restored teeth. Sub-surface cracks as short as 25 mu m were found capable of promoting tooth fracture well within 25 years from the time of restoration. Furthermore, cracks longer than 100 mu m reduced the fatigue life to less than 5 years. Consequently, sub-surface cracks introduced during cavity preparation with conventional dental burrs may serve as a principal source for premature restoration failure.

A mixed amelogenin preparation extracted from porcine developing enamel matrix (containing ""25K,"" 7.4%; ""23K,"" 10.7%; ""20K,"" 49.5%; and smaller peptides, 32.4%) was dissolved in dilute formic acid and reprecipitated by adjusting the pH to 6.8 with NaOH solution. Amelogenin gels were formed in vitro by sedimenting the precipitate in microcentrifuge tubes. The gels were fixed with Karnovsky fixative at 4 and 24 degrees C, which was found to preserve their corresponding clear (4 degrees C) and opaque (24 degrees C) states. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were employed for the microstructural characterization of the fixed clear and opaque gels. The amelogenin gel matrix was observed to possess a hierarchical structure of quasi-spherical amelogenin nanospheres and their assemblies. The nanospheres of diameters 8-20 nm assemble to form small spherical assemblies of diameters 40-70 nm that further aggregated to form large spherical assemblies of 70-300 nm in diameter. In the clear gel, most of the large assemblies are smaller than 150 nm, and the nanospheres and assemblies are uniformly dispersed, allowing an even fluid distribution among them. In the opaque gel, however, numerous spherical fluid-filled spaces ranging from 0.3 to 7 mu m in diameter were observed with the majority of the large assemblies sized 150-200 nm in diameter. These spaces presumably result from enhanced hydrophobic interactions among nanospheres and/or assemblies as the temperature increased. The high opacity of the opaque (24 degrees C) gel apparently arises from the presence of the numerous fluid-filled spaces observed compared to the low-temperature (4 degrees C) preparation. These observations suggest that the hydrophobic interactions among nanospheres and different orders of amelogenin assemblies are important in determining the structural integrity of the dental enamel matrix.

All materials were seeded with either pig/human retinal pigment epithelial cells or rabbit corneal endothelial cells and were maintained in tissue culture conditions. Upon confluency, the cell density was calculated and cell viability determined. All monolayers were stained with phalloidin-rhodamine for F-actin and antibodies to the tight junction (zonula occludens) protein, ZO(1), to demonstrate the presence of tight junctions. The final cell density of human RPE monolayers on PLLA films was 2950 cells/mm(2) (+/-185). The final cell density of pig RPE on PLLA and PLGA film was 2350 cells/mm(2) (+/-152 and 178, respectively). Rabbit corneal endothelial cells had a final cell density of 2650 cells/mm(2) (+/-164). F-actin staining revealed a circumferential ring of actin filaments in all of the cells grown on substrates. ZO1 immunohistochemistry demonstrated staining along the lateral cell borders of all cell types. The successful culture of retinal pigment epithelial and corneal endothelial monolayers on these substrates may have potential for transplanting cell monolayers in the eye to improve vision.","Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Dept Otolaryngol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Childrens Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Louisville, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",,,,,NEI NIH HHS [EY02853],,,28,59,71,0,5,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,JUN,1999.0,5,3,,,,,187,196,,10.1089/ten.1999.5.187,,,,10,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,211UC,WOS:000081179400001,10434067.0,,,,2019-02-25

With the development of new disciplines within biomaterials research such as tissue engineering and cellular therapy, information at molecular and structural levels is needed in order to conceive and design biomaterials that elicit specific, functional cell responses. In this study we determined the formation of focal adhesions and fibronectin fibrillar structures by human fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells adhered to fibronectin-precoated, smooth, and textured silicones as a function of time. Textures consisted of parallel ridges and 0.5 mu m deep grooves with a width of 2, 5, and 10 mu m. In addition, pillar and well constructs were used. Cells assembled focal adhesions within the first 24 h of adhesion. Fibronectin production and assembly resulted in a dense fibrillar network at day 6. Initial focal adhesion density and size were dictated by the presence of the texture. Topography also influenced initial fibronectin deposition, although the differences did not result in apparent differences in fibronectin networks after 6 days of incubation. Without fibronectin preadsorption, cells did not proliferate on the silicone surfaces. Cells adhered to glass removed all the preadsorbed fibronectin, whereas on silicone they did not. The present study shows that different textures initially give rise to differences in focal contact and fibronectin fibril assembly. The effects of the small, initial in vitro differences on in vivo tissue biocompatibility remains to be studied.","Univ Groningen, Dept Biomed Engn, Groningen, Netherlands; Ohio State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,,,,,,70,51,51,0,13,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-4947,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,JUN,1999.0,5,3,,,,,223,240,,,,,,18,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,211UC,WOS:000081179400004,10434070.0,,,,2019-02-25

Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells. Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues. The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems. The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly a-hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA). Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells. The pre shaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step. Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4 mm, articular joint defects of rabbits. Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix. 80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo. However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue. These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction. The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.","Dept Rheumatol Charite, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; German Rheumatism Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; German Rheumatism Res Ctr, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Dept Orthoped Charite, D-10098 Berlin, Germany","Sittinger, M (reprint author), Dept Rheumatol Charite, Tucholskystr 2, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,21,52,59,0,11,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,DARMSTADT,"PLATZ DER DEUTSCHEN EINHEIT 25, D-64293 DARMSTADT, GERMANY",0340-1855,,,Z RHEUMATOL,Z.

The presence of an amino group also makes it one of the most straightforward to functionalize. Unfortunately however, it tends to form micelles and hexagonal clusters instead of forming lamellar systems such as sheets and vesicles (liposomes), key supramolecular structures for a variety of biomedical and other technical applications. This has been overcome by synthesizing a dimeric phosphatidyl ethanolamine molecule in which the acyl chains at the 2-position of glycerol are joined at their termini by a carbon-carbon bond, thus resulting in a trans-membrane type fatty acyl linkage. Such tail-to-tail bipolar transmembrane lipids are found in the membranes of thermophilic and other extremophilic bacteria. The dimeric phosphatidyl ethanolamine readily forms very uniformly flat self-assembled lamellar supramolecular arrays and liposomes that are stable at temperatures up to 80 degrees C. The planar systems formed by the new lipid were characterized by atomic force microscopy, and the uniformity of the vesicles was observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, The thermal stability of the phospholipid and the vesicles formed was examined by NMR spectroscopy including proton T-1 measurements as a function of temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated a much greater order of the alkyl chain in the dimer than in phosphatidyl ethanolamine. This extremely stable and readily functionalizable dimeric phospholipid has potential uses in the fabrication of biomaterials, stable membrane models, and liposome drug-delivery systems.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Hollingsworth, RI (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,40,26,26,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0022-3263,,,J ORG CHEM,J.

Much work has been done on the use of a wide variety of cryoprotectant compounds for these types of processes. Chief among these compounds are the saccharides. They have been found to protect proteins during freezing and drying stresses as well as prevent membrane damage during cooling of cells. Trehalose, a naturally occurring disaccharide of glucose, has been found to be a particularly effective cryoprotectant. Although there are several prevailing structural and thermodynamic arguments as to why molecules such as trehalose act as cryoprotectants, little fundamental work has been done to corroborate or refute these hypotheses. To address this issue, our work has focused on the structural and dynamic simulation of this promising cryoprotective system. In this work, we have implemented fully flexible, all-atom models for water and trehalose and used both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics algorithms to calculate various macroscopic properties of trehalose solutions over a wide range of concentration. We have also studied the glass transition behavior at various concentrations and compared it to experimental data. We have observed the existence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which has been invoked to explain compressibility and molar volume data for concentrated solutions of trehalose. We have studied the diffusivity of water molecules in concentrated trehalose solutions and found a gradual transition from continuous motion through the matrix in more diluted systems to cavity-hopping motion in concentrated and near-glassy cases. Our diffusivity results have been analyzed in terms of the Williams-Landel-Feny equation; good agreement is found with published glass transition data.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","de Pablo, JJ (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem Engn, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,44,113,115,2,27,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5639,,,J PHYS CHEM A,J.

The effect of HA loadings and various thermal processing conditions on the crystallinity of the PEEK polymer and its composites were investigated using two different methods, i.e, density analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). From density analysis, it was observed that HA loadings did not influence the crystallinity of the composites as compared to DSC, which indicated that the crystallinity increased slightly with IIA loadings. Thermal processing parameters such as melt temperature, residence time and cooling rate was found to influence the structural characteristics of HA reinforced PEEK composites. In general, increasing the thermal processing parameter resulted in a decrease in crystallinity. A similar trend was observed for both the techniques used. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

These materials are chosen because they are widely used in the held of orthopedic surgery. Contact angles (sessile drop) and surface tension (du Nouy's ring method) are measured in standardized conditions which take into account the various parameters disturbing wetting phenomena. An original cumulative deposits method (CDM) described here permits observation of the evolution of the wettability and allows estimation of the protein adhesion rate. Two families of materials emerge according to their behavior when they are in contact with the protein solution. One set (a chromium cobalt alloy and two polyethylenes) presents no detectable adhesion. The other set (stainless steel, zirconia, alumina, virgin and nitrogen implanted titanium alloy) shows a cumulative adhesion of proteins. We propose to adopt a BSA buffered solution as a referential sensor to characterize solid surfaces.

The grafted amounts of PAAc were dependent on the grafting time, chat of PA-6 being higher than that of PE. It was confirmed that the surface of the fibers constructing the fabric was fully covered with PAAc after the 20 min reaction. The surface of the PAAc grafted fabrics was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The leakage of electrostatic charge from the fabric was determined and the dyeability was studied with methylene blue. The period of time in which the charge potential attenuated to 1/2 of the initial potential decreased drastically by grafting with PAAc.

Attachment of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may add to these characteristics and valorize collagen. In this study, porous type I collagen matrices were crosslinked using dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment and/or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), in the presence and absence of chondroitin sulphate (CS). EDC covalently attaches CS to collagen. DHT crosslinking preserved a porous matrix structure. However, attachment of CS to DHT-treated matrices using EDC, resulted in collapsed surfaces, CS located only at the matrix exterior. EDC crosslinking resulted in a partial matrix collapse. This could be prevented if crosslinking was carried out in the presence of ethanol. Matrix porosity was then preserved. The presence of CS during EDC crosslinking resulted in covalent immobilization of CS throughout the matrix. The amount of CS incorporated was increased if crosslinking was performed in the presence of ethanol. EDC-crosslinked matrices, with and without CS, had increased denaturation temperatures and decreased flee amine group contents. The susceptibility of these matrices towards degradation by proteolytic enzymes was diminished. Immobilized CS increased the water-binding capacity and decreased the denaturation temperature and tensile strength. Immobilized CS bound anti-CS antibodies and was susceptible to chondroitinase ABC digestion, demonstrating its bioavailability. The modified matrices were not cytotoxic as was established using human myoblast and fibroblast culture systems. It is concluded that the use of ethanol during EDC crosslinking offers an elegant means for the preparation of defined porous collagenous matrices containing bioavailable, covalently attached CS.

Reaction of DSC with BDDGE at pH 4.5 yielded a material (BD45) with a T-s of 64 degrees C, hardly any reduction in amine groups and a lower stability towards enzymatic degradation as compared to BD90. The tensile strength of BD45 (9.2 MPa) was substantially improved as compared to N-DSC (2.4 MPa), whereas the elongation at break was reduced from 210 to 140%. BD90 had a tensile strength of 2.6 MPa and an elongation at break of only 93%. To improve the resistance to enzymes and to retain the favorable tensile properties, BD45 was post-treated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to give BD45EN. Additional cross-linking via the formation of amide bonds took place as indicated by the T-s of 81 degrees C and the residual number of amine groups of 19 (n/1000). BD45EN was stable during exposure to both collagenase and pronase solutions. The tensile properties (tensile strength 7.2 MPa, elongation at break 100%) were comparable to those of BD45 and glutaraldehyde treated controls (G-DSC). Acylation of the residual amine groups of BD45 with acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (HAc-NHS) yielded BD45HAc with a large reduction in amine groups to 10 (n/1000) and a small reduction in T-s to 62 degrees C.

Every one of these procedures requires some period of contact with blood with several different biomaterials used in the manufacture of assist devices or implant devices. In view of the increasing importance of the biomaterials in clinical practice, it would be timely to review briefly physicochemical characterization as well as biological evaluations. Blood compatibility encompasses a variety of events associated with blood interaction with the biomaterials used in various procedures. Two separate coagulation mechanisms are involved (arterial and venous) depending upon the flow characteristics. At least three Interacting factors modulate normal hemostasis and the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events. They are the state of activation of coagulation cascade, circulating levels of thrombin and fibrinogen and relative activity of platelets. In this overview we discuss the current concepts on the role of platelets in blood-biomaterial interactions. When blood contacts a biomaterial surface a variety of blood components interact with the surface. Some of the key players in platelet activation on biomaterial surface include fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Currently available antiplatelet drugs effectively block aggregation and secretion induced by physiological agonists such as epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane in suspension. However, they do not prevent platelet interaction on biomaterial surfaces. Mechanisms involved in platelet activation In suspension and on surfaces as well as the pharmacology of newer antiplatelet drugs will be discussed.","Univ Minnesota, Acad Hlth Ctr, Inst Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Rao, GHR (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Acad Hlth Ctr, Inst Biomed Engn, PB 609 UMHC,420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,"Rao, Gundu H.R./0000-0002-2692-7950",,,,35,12,13,0,12,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0250-4707,0973-7669,,B MATER SCI,Bull.

The goal of this study was to characterize the in vivo antithrombin properties of a novel Dacron surface with covalently linked recombinant hirudin (rHir) implanted in a canine thoracic aorta with high flow and shear rates. rHir was bound to a knitted Dacron patch using crosslinker-modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a basecoat protein. BSA was first reacted with the heterobifunctional crosslinker, sulfo-SMCC, This BSA-SMCC complex was then bound to the carboxylic acid groups of hydrolyzed Dacron patches using the carbodiimide crosslinker, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. Iodinated, Traut's-modified rHir (I-125-rHir-SH) was then reacted with the Dacron-BSA-SMCC surface, thereby covalently binding I-125-rHir. Graft segments were washed and sonicated to remove any nonspecifically bound I-125-rHir. Dacron-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir patches (n = 5) and control Dacron-BSA patches (n = 5) were implanted in series in the thoracic aortas of canines. These patches were exposed to nonheparinized, arterial blood flow for 2 hours. Patches were explanted and assessed for I-125-rHir loss. Antithrombin activity of explanted 1-cm(2) patch segments was evaluated using a chromogenic assay with 1, 5, 10, 15 units of added thrombin. Light microscopy was performed to qualitatively examine the pseudointima. Two animals were excluded from the study owing to excessive bleeding through the knitted I-125- rHir patch. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative I-125-rHir gamma counts revealed an overall decrease of 20 +/- 5.4% over the period studied. Explanted I-125-rHir patch segments were able to inhibit 1, 5, and 7 NIHU of thrombin, demonstrating retained antithrombin activity. Gross and microscopic examination of the control and test Dacron surfaces showed marked differences. Dacron surfaces with covalently bound I-125-rHir had no gross thrombus and a thin pseudointima of platelets and plasma proteins. In contrast, the control patches had a thick pseudointima composed of fibrin-rich thrombus. rHir, covalently bound to Dacron patches, maintains its biologic activity as well as prevents thrombus formation on the graft surface. This novel antithrombin coating, by modifying the blood/ graft interface, may improve both short- and long-term patency in small-diameter prosthetic arterial grafts and has applications with respect to other implantable or indwelling biomaterials.

A good implantation of biomaterials in the skeleton is to reach full integration of non-living implant with living bone. The aim of this study is to compare the resorption kinetics of four kinds of calcium phosphate ceramics: hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)), hydroxyapatite doped with manganese or zinc and a composite material of 75% hydroxyapatite and 25% beta-tricalcium phosphate (Ca-3(PO4)(2)) Cylinders (5-6 mm in diameter) of these ceramics were packed into holes made in the femur diaphysis of mature ovine. At 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after the operation, bone/implant interface was embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. We used the PIXE method (particle induced X-ray emission) to measure the distribution of mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Mn and Fe) at the bone/implant interface. At 4, 8; 16, 28 and 48 weeks after implantation we studied a biopsy of the ceramics by neutron activation method. Then, we have a global measurement of mineral elements in the biomaterial. The results showed that the resorption kinetics of hydroxyapatite doped with zinc was faster than that of the three other bioceramics.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 2, France; Lab Phys Corpusculaire Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IN2P3, F-63177 Aubiere, France; Inst Phys Nucl Expt, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Soc Ind Bioland, F-31100 Toulouse, France","Jallot, E (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader, F-51685 Reims 2, France.",,,,,,,21,26,26,0,6,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-0042,,,EUR PHYS J-APPL PHYS,Eur.

Recently, we have shown that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 can independently induce human macrophage fusion to form FBGC via a macrophage mannose receptor (MR) -mediated pathway. The MR is believed to mediate both endocytosis of glycoproteins and phagocytosis of microorganisms, which bear terminal mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or glucose residues. Polarization of microfilaments to closely apposed macrophage membranes as observed with fluorescence confocal microscopy led us to ask whether MR-mediated fusion occurred via a filamentous actin-dependent pathway. Cytochalasins B and D and latrunculin-A, agents that disrupt microfilaments, inhibited macrophage fusion in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of cytochalasins D and B that inhibited fusion did not significantly decrease macrophage adhesion, spreading, or motility but did inhibit internalization of Candida albicans during interleukin-13-enhanced, MR-mediated phagocytosis, Very low concentrations of cytochalasin B (< 2 mu M) induced a slight enhancement of macrophage fusion, Taken together, the results of this study suggest that cytokine-induced, MR-mediated macrophage fusion requires an intact F-actin cytoskeleton and that the mechanism of fusion is similar to phagocytosis.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Anderson, JM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, 2085 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 55714],,,53,47,47,0,4,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,MAY,1999.0,13,8,,,,,823,832,,,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,197NZ,WOS:000080372500006,10224226.0,,,,2019-02-25

The advantages and limitations of each radiopaque polymeric material are summarized. The main method used to make medical implants radiologically visible is based on blending polymers with conventional radiopaque agents, blends which usually are a physical mixture of acrylic derivatives and inorganic salts, Other methods reported involve either the formation of single-phase radiopaque polymer salt complexes somehow preventing the release of the radiopacifying element by entrapment of the complex in a crosslinked network, or radiopaque polymerized monomers characterized by a radiopacifying element associated with the monomer unit prior to polymerization, In the near future, research will certainly concentrate on biocompatible radiopaque polymers,vith covalently bound opaque elements leading to stable polymers with properties equivalent to the nonopaque, parent polymer.","Univ Geneva, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Div Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Geneva, Switzerland","Doelker, E (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, 30 Quai E Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,,,,,134,38,38,1,30,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0020-9996,,,INVEST RADIOL,Invest.

The surface chemistry of each substrate was defined by X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy, surface wettability by the dispersive, and the polar components of the surface energies. Osteoclast adhesion was modulated by the polar component of the surface energy: fewer (p < 0.01) osteoclasts adhered to C-HA (97 +/- 20/slice, surface energy 9 +/- 5 mJ/m(2)) than to HA (234 +/- 16/slice, surface energy 44 +/- 2 mJ/m(2)) or to C (268 +/- 37/slice, surface energy 58 +/- 0.5 mJ/m(2)). Actin rings, which are the cytoskeletal structure essential for re-sorption, developed on all three materials. The area of the actin ring, which is resorbed by local acidification, and the osteoclast area, which reflects osteoclast spreading, were both greater in osteoclasts cultured on IIA and C-HA than in those cultured on C. C was resorbed, hut HA and C-HA were not. Thus, we surface energy plays an Essential role in osteoclast adhesion, whereas osteoclast spreading may depend on the surface chemistry, especially on protein adsorption and/or on newly formed apatite layers. Resorption may be limited to the solubility of the biomaterial.

The materials characterization, enzymatic degradability and peptide (insulin) release from solutions of the copolymers were examined. Distribution of bioactive peptides within the polymer chain is well-known for combinations of PEG and polysaccharides as aqueous polymer two-phase systems. Insulin was preferentially partitioned into the PEG phase in a PEG/HA solution system. Enzymatic degradation of the copolymers was strongly dependent on the PEG content. Thermal analysis revealed that PEG-g-HA exhibited a variation in phase-separated structures depending on the PEG content. The solution of PEG-g-HA enabled insulin to remain in the PEG moieties dispersed in the HA matrix. Leakage of insulin from the copolymers was dependent upon the PEG content. Leakage rate of insulin from copolymer containing between 7 and 39% by weight of PEG were similar. A dramatic increase in leakage rate occurred when the PEG content was increased to greater than 39% by weight. It is considered that the loaded insulin was partitioned into the PEG moieties and became entangled with the PEG chains. The conformational change of insulin was effectively prevented in PEG-g-HA solutions, although insulin was denatured in storage of both phosphate buffered solution and HA solution. Such a heterogeneous-structured polymeric solution may be advantageous as an injectable therapeutic formulation for ophthalmic or arthritis treatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Application of surface modification technology to reduce the incidence of thrombus formation on MHV is a novel undertaking. This requires collaboration within the bioengineering and cardiothoracic surgery fields. From reviewing results of recent and past investigations, and our own preliminary study with diamond-like carbon coating (DLC) and plasma or glow discharge treatment (GDT) of MHV, we identify and discuss several potentially beneficial effects that may reduce the extent of valve-related thrombogenesis by surface modification. DLC and GDT may affect the surfaces of MHV in many ways, including cleaning of organic and inorganic debris, generating reactive and functional groups on the surface layers without affecting their bulk properties, and making the surfaces more adherent to endothelial cells and albumin and less adherent to platelets. These different effects of surface modification, separately or in combination, may transform the surfaces of MHV to be more thromboresistant in the vascular system.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Div Surg Res, Dept Surg, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch,Cooper Hlth Syst, Camden, NJ USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Div Ophthalmol Surg, Dept Surg, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch,Cooper Hlth Syst, Camden, NJ USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Div Cardiothorac Surg, Dept Surg, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch,Cooper Hlth Syst, Camden, NJ USA","Hewitt, CW (reprint author), Cooper Univ Hosp, 3 Cooper Plaza,Suite 411, Camden, NJ 08103 USA.",chewitt@umdnj.edu,,,,,,50,64,70,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1939,1521-0553,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Previous experimental work was extended by the use of MQP-B(TM) 1.4-mu m-radius particles, which have extremely high coercivity and remanent magnetic field, and in which rotation of magnetic domains within the particle does not occur. The microrheometer was tested with a series of Newtonian viscosity standards (100-10 000 poise) and found to accurately predict viscosity (error range 3%-9%). The effects of shape, size distribution, sedimentation, particle-particle magnetic interactions, and agglomeration were investigated and found to be either negligible or easily determined. This microrheometer can be used to determine the rheological properties of minute quantities of viscous fluids and may be applicable to the measurement of zero-shear-rate viscosity of viscoelastic fluids.

The aim of this study was to compare the behavior of two types of biomaterial widely used in clinical practice, polypropylene (PL) and polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), after a second laparotomy involving the implant, The behavior, in terms of tensile resistance and integration with tissues, of intact prostheses was compared to that of prostheses subjected to opening and repair. Methods: A defect (7 x 5 cm) involving all tissue layers was created in the anterior abdominal wall of 24 male New Zealand rabbits. These defects were repaired with a reticular, macroporous PL mesh (Marlex, Bard Card., Madrid, Spain) or a laminar, micro/macroporous ePTFE prosthesis (Mycro Mesh, W.L, Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) of similar size to the defect. Four study groups were established: Intact PL/Intact ePTFE (n=6 each): animals implanted with a PL or ePTFE prosthesis and sacrificed 90 days after implant; Repaired PL/Repaired ePTFE (n=6 each): animals implanted with a PL or ePTFE prosthesis subjected to midlongitudinal relaparotomy through the center of the prosthesis 90 days postimplant, followed by repair with continuous polypropylene 4/0 suture. Animals in repaired groups were sacrificed 90 days after the second intervention. Specimens comprised of prosthesis and neoformed tissue were subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, 2 cm-wide strips, consisting of the prosthesis and anchorage tissue, were subjected to biomechanical analysis using an Instron tensiometer (Instron, Canton, MA). The results obtained were statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: The intact PL implants were fully infiltrated by dense,disorganized, well-vascularized scar tissue with fibers concentric to the mesh monofilaments. The appearance of the repaired FL prostheses was similar, with establishment of neoformed tissue in repaired areas of the prosthesis such that both cut edges of the prosthesis were joined together. In contrast, intact ePTFE prostheses were encapsulated by organized tissue with fibers running parallel to the surface of the biomaterial. Repaired ePTFE prostheses including sutured areas were similarly encapsulated. But the edges of the sutured middle area did not fuse. Tensile resistance values of intact and repaired PL prostheses were similar (intact, mean, 34.78 Newtons; repaired, mean, 34.74N, p > 0.001). Tensile resistance values of intact ePTFE implants were significantly different to those of the repaired ePTFE prostheses (intact, mean, 22.64N; repaired, mean, 17.21N, p < 0.001), Breakage of both types of PL specimen strips was restricted to recipient tissue while breakage of intact ePTFE specimens occurred in the areas of anchorage to the abdominal wall. Rupture of repaired ePTFE specimens took place in the sutured central areas of the prostheses. Conclusions: We conclude that relaparotomy through an existing PL prosthesis previously integrated with the abdominal wall does not affect the tissue integration process or the tensile resistance of the implant. When the relaparotomy involves an ePTFE prosthesis, however, although the repair process itself is unaffected, significant loss in tensile strength is incurred. In addition, relaparotomy through both types of biomaterial is likely to result in the neoformation of adhesions in the areas of the prosthesis subjected to opening and repair but, in general, the number of adhesions formed in the presence of intact or repaired polypropylene implants was larger than that observed with the use of ePTFE.

Modern biomaterials could be composed of various components, e.g. metals, ceramics, natural tissues, polymers. In this last group, the hydrogels, hydrophilic polymeric gels with requested biocompatibility and designed interaction with living surrounding seem to be one of the most promising group of biomaterials. Especially, if they are formed by means of ionizing radiation. In early 1950s, the pioneers of the radiation chemistry of polymers began some experiments with radiation crosslinking of hydrophilic polymers. However, hydrogels were analyzed mainly from the point of view of the phenomenon associated with radiation synthesis, with topology of network and relation between radiation parameters of the processes. Fundamental monographs on radiation polymer physics and chemistry written by A. Charlesby (Atomic Radition and polymers, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1960) and A. Chapiro (Radiation Chemistry of Polymeric Systems, Interscience, New York, 1962) proceed from this time. The noticeable interest in the application of radiation techniques to obtain hydrogels for biomedical purposes began in the late sixties as a result of the papers and patents invented by Japanese and American scientists, headed by Kaetsu in Japan and Hoffman in USA. Immobilization of biologically active species in hydrogel matrices, their use as drug delivery systems and enzyme traps as well as the modification of material surfaces to improve biocompatibility and their ability to bond antigens and antibodies had been the main subjects of these investigations. In this article a brief summary of investigations on mechanism and kinetics of radiation formation of hydrogels as well as some examples of commercialized hydrogel biomaterials have been presented.

That means that the phenomena which seats at the interface between the implant and the host tissues does not induce neither any deleterious effect, such as chronic inflammatory response, nor the formation of unusual tissues. Thus it is of paramount importance to design biomaterials, used for the fabrication of implants, with the best appropriate surface properties. At the same time these biomaterials must feature bulk properties which meet other requirements, especially mechanical properties, deriving from the intended function of the implant in which they are involved. As it is quite impossible to design biomaterials which fulfil at the same time both types of requirements, it is commonly agreed that the solution to this issue goes through the selection or the design of biomaterials with adequate bulk properties, and a further treatment of the surface which would improve the properties of the latter. In this respect ionizing radiations and plasma based treatments, offer a wide panel of possibilities; as an example we describe here how the surface of expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) samples can be activated using cold plasma, in order to open a way to chemical modifications of such a surface. Subsequently, Radio Frequency Glow Discharge (RFGD) containing oligopeptides, known for their role in mediating the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, were bound to the modified surface, and the affinity of endothelial cells for the latter was investigated.

In order to reduce their thrombogenicity which remains the major obstacle, polymeric materials endowed with a specific affinity for Antithrombin III (ATIII) and thus able to catalyse the inhibition of thrombin by ATIII, as heparin does, were devised. Sulfonate and sulfonamide groups were introduced on phenyl rings belonging to styrene residues which were radiation grafted (swift heavy ions and gamma radiation) onto poly(vinylene difluoride) (PVDF) and poly(hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride) (P(VDF-HFP)). Contrary to gamma radiation grafting, with swift heavy ions grafting, only small regions are modified; thus, the properties of the initial substrate are preserved. A characterization of surface topography was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy. The efficacy of the surface modification was monitored with respect to the total amount of bound ""heparin-like"" molecules measured by a toluidine blue assay, and the anticoagulant potential estimated by the thrombin time test.

To facilitate the fabrication of complex biomaterial surfaces, we have previously described the synthesis and application of a poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) block copolymer (PLA-PEG) with the biotinylated PEG end groups (final polymer termed PLA-PEG-biotin). This polymer is biodegradable and resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, and the biotin moiety allows surface chemical engineering to be achieved using avidin-biotin interactions. Here, we describe a detailed surface analysis of this polymer using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. This analysis has revealed that the avidin-biotin surface engineering strategy is a rapid method of immobilizing biomolecules at biomaterial surfaces under aqueous conditions. The surface engineering generates a specific and high-density change in surface structure. The effect of PLA segment molecular weight and the influence of the surfactant on the nature of the surface engineering has been determined with the objective of proving that the extent of specific ligand immobilization is controllable and resilient to surface stabilization by surfactants.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009","Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,24,74,76,0,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,APR 27,1999.0,15,9,,,,,3157,3161,,10.1021/la9803575,,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,192YG,WOS:000080106900023,,,,,2019-02-25

We used optical reflectometry to measure the extent and kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption to smooth spin-cast films prepared from two poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) samples that have different end-groups, one being a hydrophilic carboxylic end group and the other a hydrophobic ester end group. One of us has previously shown that these end-groups influence microsphere degradation (Tracy et al., 1998, Factors affecting the degradation rate of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres in vivo and in vitro. Biomaterials: submitted for publication.). Both films were moderately hydrophobic, and their wettability was independent of the type of end-group. BSA adsorbed readily to both native PLG films, attaining as much as 50% surface coverage by area and was insensitive to the type of end-group. Aging the films in water for 24 h prior to BSA exposure decreased the hydrophobicity of the films and this in turn correlated with a significant decrease in the initial BSA adsorption rate. This was consistent with the often-observed trend that surface hydrophobicity favors protein adsorption. In spite of the lower adsorption affinity revealed by this decreased initial adsorption rate, the final adsorbed amounts on the aged films exceeded those attained on native films, presumably due to the increase in total surface area produced by partial PLG erosion.

But attempts to imprint proteins have met with only limited success(11-15). Here we report a method for imprinting surfaces with protein-recognition sites. We use radio-frequency glow-discharge plasma deposition to form polymeric thin films(16) around proteins coated with disaccharide molecules. The disaccharides become covalently attached to the polymer film, creating polysaccharide-like cavities that exhibit highly selective recognition for a variety of template proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, ribonuclease and streptavidin, Direct imaging of template recognition is achieved by patterning a surface at the micrometre scale with imprinted regions.","Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ratner, BD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Box 351720, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Tsai, Wei-Bor/B-7953-2011",,,,,31,522,563,6,225,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,APR 15,1999.0,398,6728,,,,,593,597,,,,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,186WX,WOS:000079754700050,10217142.0,,,,2019-02-25

Consideration of this phenotype suggested to us that the foreign body reaction (FBR) might be altered in thrombospondin 2 (TSP2)-null mice. To investigate the participation of TSP2 in the FBR, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and oxidized PDMS (ox-PDMS) disks were implanted in TSP2-null and control mice. Growth of TSP2-null and control skin fibroblasts in vitro also was evaluated on both types of disks. Normal fibroblasts grew as a monolayer on both surfaces, but attachment of the cells to ox-PDMS was weak and sensitive to movement. TSP2-null fibroblasts grew as aggregates on both surfaces, and their attachment was further compromised on ox-PDMS. After a 4-week implantation period, both types of PDMS elicited a similar FBR with a collagenous capsule in both TSP2-null and control mice, However, strikingly, the collagenous capsule that formed in TSP2-null mice was highly vascularized and thicker than that formed in normal mice. In addition, abnormally shaped collagen fibers were observed in capsules from mutant mice. These observations indicate that the presence or absence of an extracellular matrix component, TSP2, can influence the nature of the FBR, in particular its vascularity. The expression of TSP2 therefore could represent a molecular target for local inhibitory measures when vascularization of the tissue surrounding an implanted device is desired.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bornstein, P (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Box 357350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE08229]; NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL018645, HL18645]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296]",,,37,116,117,0,1,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

One approach that is used to decrease contamination of manufactured devices by microorganisms is using materials that easily slough off accumulated material (i.e., fouling release surfaces). The compounds currently used for this purpose rely on low surface energy to inhibit strong attachment of organisms. In this study, we examined the possible use of environmentally responsive (or ""smart"") polymers as a new class of fouling release agents; a surface-grafted thermally responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM), was used as a model compound. PNIPAAM is known to have a lower critical solubility temperature of similar to 32 degrees C (i.e., it is insoluble in water at temperatures above 32 degrees C acid is soluble at temperatures below 32 degrees C), Under experimental conditions, >90% of cultured microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Halomonas marina) and naturally occurring marine microorganisms that attached to grafted PNIPAAM surfaces during 2-, 18-, 36-, and 72-h incubations were removed when the hydration stale of the polymer was changed from a wettability that was favorable for attachment to a wettability that was less favorable, Of particular significance is the observation that an organism known to attach in the greatest numbers to hydrophobic substrata (i.e., H. marina) was removed when transition of PNIPAAM to a more hydrated state occurred, whereas an organism that attaches in the greatest numbers to hydrophilic substrata (i.e., S. epidermidis) was removed when the opposite transition occurred. Neither solvated nor desolvated PNIPAAM exhibited intrinsic fouling release properties, indicating that the phase transition was the important factor in removal of organisms. Based on our observations of the behavior of this model system, we suggest that environmentally responsive polymers represent a new approach for controlling biofouling release.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Chem & Nucl Engn, Farris Engn Ctr 209, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Lopez, GP (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Chem & Nucl Engn, Farris Engn Ctr 209, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",gplopez@unm.edu,"Ista, Linnea/A-5029-2016","Ista, Linnea/0000-0002-8747-9987",NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,34,119,120,0,30,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171 USA",0099-2240,,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

An adsorbed layer of calcium-phosphate was spontaneously formed on the titanium oxide surface and its thickness as well as the Ca/P ratio was found to increase with immersion time. After 71 days of immersion, the Ca/P ratio corresponded to that of brushite or monetite and after 6 months it was close to the value of hydroxyapatite. A higher Ca/P ratio was found for adsorption from solutions where the pH had been increased. After adsorption, the grains of the evaporated titanium substrate appeared slightly smoother because they were covered by a thin layer of calcium phosphate. A comparison between immersion in a Hanks' solution and solutions containing only phosphates or only calcium ions, showed that the presence of phosphates is necessary for the adsorption of Ca-ions.

The use of biomaterials in the form of microscope slides as walls in the chamber makes it possible to analyse both the biomaterial surface with regard to protein and cell binding, as well as the molecular events taking place in the fluid. Incubation of blood in the chamber, for 60 min at 37 degrees C resulted in the rapid binding of complement and coagulation proteins and of leukocytes and platelets to polyvinylchloride (PVC) slides. The cells formed a layer which more or less covered the underlying surface. Unlike complement activation, as reflected by soluble C3a and C5b-9, the thrombin-antithrombin formation was completely nullified in cell-depleted plasma Despite the fact that thrombin-antithrombin generation was also negligible in platelet-rich plasma, inhibition of platelet aggregation on the material surface with aspirin resulted in suppressed generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes. Taken together, the coagulation activation in the chamber was dependent on the presence of blood cells which suggests that bound/aggregated platelets initiate a sequence of events involving leukocytes that results in coagulation activation.

The consecutive increase of pores size as well as the use of multifilaments led to a pronounced increase of flexibility. To improve the handling during operation the initial stiffness of this low-weight large pores mesh was increased by strengthening with different amounts of absorbable polyglactin (combination of glycolide and lactide) in various forms: by coating (mesh B), adding multifilament polyglactin filaments (mesh C, Vypro(R)) or both (mesh D), respectively. To test the consequences of the different supplementary techniques all mesh Variants are implanted in a rat model. Over implantation intervals of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days we measured the tensile strength, the resulting stiffness and surveyed the tissue response, particularly in regard to the extent of inflammation and to the induced fibrosis. The results proved a sufficient mechanical stability of the material reduced and pure polypropylene mesh A without restriction of the mobility of the abdominal wall compared with a group that had simple laparotomy and closure. The histological analysis of the interface showed a minor inflammatory reaction and a dense vascularisation. The addition of polyglactin multifilaments (mesh C) reduces the number of macrophages and granulocytes as indicators for acute inflammation, showing generally a scar formation limited merely to the perifilamentary region. The abdominal wall compliance remained unchanged compared with mesh A. The coating of the polypropylene with polyglactin (mesh B and D) appeared to change the tissue reaction remarkably, favouring the formation of a connective tissue capsule around the whole mesh. The mechanical testing revealed an apparent protrusion with an increase of curvature of the artificial abdominal wall at rising intraabdominal pressures. The entire coating of the polypropylene surface with polyglactin induces an all embedding scar plate, filling out the pores and forming a tissue capsule. The complex interaction of tissue and implanted biomaterials with their distinct alterations of the tissue response confirms the necessity of in vivo experiments even after 'minor' modifications. Whereas the addition of polyglactin filaments appears to be favourable, the coating of polypropylene with polyglactin seems to hinder the incorporation of the mesh. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the control group, the defect was closed primarily. In the extraperitoneal group, polypropylene mesh was sutured over the abdominal wall after primary closure of the peritoneum and in the intraperitoneal group, polypropylene mesh was sutured to close the created defect so that it was in contact with the intestines. Main outcome measures: Bacterial translocation at 4, 24 and 48 hours. Results: Insertion of mesh in contact with the peritoneum led to increased bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes at 4 (p = 0.02) and 48 (p = 0.03) hours compared with insertion without contact. Conclusion: Contact between a foreign body and the peritoneum is required to induce bacterial translocation.","Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Ankara, Turkey; Ankara Numune Hosp, Dept Surg 6, Ankara, Turkey","Sayek, I (reprint author), Sedat Simavi Sokak 19-11, TR-06450 Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,,18,3,4,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

We have previously shown that these materials activate neutrophils by contact, leading to production of oxygen free radicals accompanied by release of granule products. Such activation further results in depletion of local host defenses, including the capacity of biomaterial-activated neutrophils to kill bacteria. Among the granule products released from neutrophils are small cationic antibacterial peptides (human neutrophil peptides [HNP]) known as defensins. Here we tested the hypothesis that defensins, released from activated neutrophils onto the surface of biomaterials, might play a role in the deactivation of subsequent neutrophil populations. Incubation of neutrophils with purified HNP resulted in a dose-related impairment of stimulus-induced oxygen radical production and of phagocytic killing. Furthermore, fresh neutrophils added to biomaterial-associated neutrophils exhibited impaired phagocytic killing. This impairment could be abrogated by antibody to HNP but not by an irrelevant antibody Taken together, these observations support the idea that neutrophils activated at a material surface can create, by means of HNP release, an environment hostile to their microbicidal function and that of their infiltrating brethren.","Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Magee Womens Res Inst, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Kaplan, SS (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Room 5930 MT CHP,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM-41734],,,79,25,26,1,5,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171 USA",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

Internal pressure gradients arise from internal heating and vaporization and significantly enhance the transport. Even a moderate internal pressure gradient in a low moisture material can cause more moisture to move to the surface than can be removed from the surface, leading to a soggy surface. A strong internal pressure gradient in a high moisture material can fully saturate the surface, leading to a very high moisture loss by liquid outflow at the surface. Addition of hot air and/or infrared heating of the surface to increase evaporation is suggested as a way to reduce surface moisture build-up. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The structural, physicochemical and mechanical parameters of these two preparations were investigated, and two different macroporous BCP1 (MBCP1) and BCP2 (MBCP2) implants were manufactured and implanted in rabbit bone for in vivo bioactivity studies. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed that MBCP1 implants had a significantly higher degradation rate (P<0.0001) than MBCP2 implants. This was probably caused by the presence of calcium oxide impurities in BCP1 and the more intimate mixture and stable ultrastructure of BCP2. No significant difference about the newly formed bone rate in these two BCP preparations was observed. Very slight variations in sintering conditions appeared to influence the biodegradation behavior of the two MBCP implants despite their identical HA/beta-TCP ratios and similar porosity.

This experimental study evaluated the osteoconductive properties of an injectable bone substitute (IBS) composed of a polymeric carrier and a calcium phosphate mineral phase, used to fill mandibular and maxillary canine extraction sockets. Methods: The polymer was a cellulose derivative (methyl-hydroxy-propyl-cellulose, MHPC), and the mineral phase consisted of granules of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics 200 to 500 mu m in diameter, Mandibular and maxillary premolars extracted from 3 dogs (a total of 60 extraction sites) were immediately treated with the IBS or left unfilled as control sites. Animals were sacrificed 3 months after implantation and all extraction sockets were prepared for histological evaluation. Results: Qualitative histological studies showed that the IBS was able to support the extensive apposition of well-mineralized newly formed lamellar bone over the entire socket surface and appeared to prevent alveolar ridge bone loss in treated extraction sites. Quantitative evaluation showed that the amount of newly formed bone was significantly higher in mandibular than maxillary extraction sockets for both treated and control sites. Conclusions: An injectable bone substitute composed of a polymeric carrier and calcium phosphate was effective in enhancing the bone fill of extraction sockets. This approach may prove promising for periodontal lesions. The material expressed osteoconductive capacities, and the biological properties of the mineral phase were conserved.","Ecole Natl Vet, Lab Chirurg, F-44307 Nantes 3, France; Fac Chirurg Dent, Equipe INSERM, Lab Rech Mat Interet Biol, Nantes, France","Gauthier, O (reprint author), Ecole Natl Vet, Lab Chirurg, Route Gachet,BP 40706, F-44307 Nantes 3, France.",,"Gauthier, Olivier/A-4639-2015; Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014; Weiss, Pierre/P-1372-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446; Weiss, Pierre/0000-0002-6159-8590; BOULER, Jean-Michel/0000-0001-9784-5584",,,,44,72,80,0,12,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690 USA",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Depending on their overall composition, these compounds are endowed with heparin-like properties such as anticoagulant activity. Indeed, some CMDBS with high CIM and S contents delay blood coagulation, whilst some derivatized dextrans without significant anticoagulant capacity are potent antiproliferative agents for rat smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro as well as heparin. The growth inhibition is dose dependent, reversible and nontoxic. This result is of prime interest for medical use because proliferation of vascular SMCs is postulated to be a key step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis or restenosis after vascular surgery such as angioplasty. By varying the overall composition in the different substituents, we have also prepared CMDBS exhibiting a stimulatory effect on the in vitro growth of human endothelial cells (EC). Heparin, under similar experimental conditions, slightly inhibited EC growth. The data indicate a synergistic role of all substituents grafted onto the dextran backbone without considering that any can be responsible alone for this effect. We conclude that a suitable distribution of CM, B and S groups on dextran can mimic heparin activity in terms of anticoagulant activity and antiproliferative capacity on SMC growth. Moreover, some CMDBS are also endowed with a stimulatory effect on EC growth. These properties confer great interest to these synthetic polysaccharides for vascular therapy.

The degree of cross-linking was evaluated by assaying the released amount of hydroxyproline (Hyp) from the matrix, and comparing it with the positive controls of valves treated by glutaraldehyde (GA) solution (0.625 wt%) and the negative controls of non-treated fresh valves. The undigested weight ratio of the specimens increased Ly increasing the UV irradiation time. The undigested weight of the leaflets, tunica interna and tunica externa of the fresh, GA-treated and UV-irradiated specimens after collagenase digestion was compared. As UV irradiation increased, the amount of released hydroxyproline was gradually decreased until 8 hours of irradiation, alter which the released hydroxyproline-reduction occurred slightly until 24 hours of irradiation time in this system. A total 47.68% of the hydroxyproline in the valve was cross-linked by UV irradiation after 24 hours, while 73.74% of the hydroxyproline in the positive control was crossed-linked. Light microscopic observation revealed that the typical crimp pattern of collagen fibers decreased and was rearranged into a dense flattened pattern as the UV irradiation induced interfibrilar cross-linking. GA-treated valves demonstrated a denser matrix pattern than the UV-irradiated specimens. Cross-linked collagenous tissue prepared by UV irradiation would be useful for improving durability and reducing the disadvantages related to using a chemical cross-linking agent.","Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, Seoul 120752, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, Seoul 120752, South Korea","Suh, H (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",hwal@yumc.yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,36,11,11,0,1,YONSEI UNIV COLL MEDICINE,SEOUL,"50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,1976-2437,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

They are generally associated with clinical infections predominantly of prothetic hip joints, heart valves and catheters. Sessile microorganisms may be intimately associated with each other and to solid substratum through binding to and inclusion into exopolymer matrices an biofilms. The establishment of functional colonies within the exopolymeric matrices generate physico-chemical gradients within biofilms, that modify the metabolism and cell-wall properties of the microorganism. A consequence of biofilm growth is enhanced microbial resistance to chemical antimicrobial agents and antibiotics. Investigations on the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics, antiseptics and antimicrobial heavy ions, however, gave controversial results. No single antimicrobial substance has been developed for the efficient eradication of adherent bacteria. This review elucidates the mechanisms of microbial resistance in biofilms and strategies for the prevention of biofilm development. Pharmacokinetical and pharmacodynamical issues for the screening of biofilm-active drugs are presented. Combinations of antistaphylococcal antibiotics with rifampin may be advantageous for preventing and curing biomaterial infections.","Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Clin Orthoped, Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Clin Prothet Dent, D-50935 Cologne, Germany","Schierholz, JM (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, Goldenfelsstr 19-21, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",,,,,,,60,28,30,1,3,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0934-8840,,,ZBL BAKT-INT J MED M,Zent.bl.

At the air-water interface, the nominal equilibrium spreading area of copolymers that have the same PPO content, or ""core"", increases with increasing PEO content by an amount equivalent to the area of the hydrated ethylene ether subunits. With compression, a PEG-dependent transition from an expanded to a more condensed monolayer occurs at similar to 10 dyn.cm(-1), presumably because of condensation of PEO segments onto the core and out of the plane of the surface. Consistent with these results and interpretation, the thickness of adsorbed films of copolymers from series that have fixed cores increases approximately linearly with ethylene oxide content. At collapse of copolymer films, the nominal area per molecule-regardless of the number of ether functions in the PEO segment-is that of the hydrated PPO core. On the basis of these data, we propose models for the structure and ordering of triblock copolymers in condensed films, and we relate these models to the gradation in protein resistance observed for such films.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA","Retzinger, GS (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",,"Gehrke, Stevin/A-5265-2014",,,,,42,29,29,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAR 30,1999.0,15,7,,,,,2580,2585,,10.1021/la9811113,,,,6,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,183EL,WOS:000079541000050,,,,,2019-02-25

Such tissue engineering requires application of biomaterials that selectively control the attachment, morphology, and proliferation of muscle progenitor (""satellite"") cells. This study examined the initial attachment, morphological characteristics, and proliferative behavior of murine C2C12 myoblasts on glass substrata derivatized with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the organosiloxanes N-(2-aminoethyl)(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (EDA) and tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-dimethylchlorosilane (13F). The fraction of myoblasts resisting detachment upon rinsing was greater on EDA than on 13F. Application of a quantitative moments-based analysis of cell morphology demonstrated that projected area and two size-invariant metrics of shape (extension and dispersion) for these cells were greater for EDA than for 13F. Myoblasts also proliferated faster on EDA than on 13F. These data indicate that EDA-derivatized glass provides a superior substratum for myoblast culture compared to 13F-derivatized glass. Understanding myoblast behavior on these biomaterials that promotes contrasting cellular responses is the first step toward using patterned SAMs to control myotube alignment for tissue engineering skeletal muscle.

The exudate formed inside cylindrical tubes subcutaneously implanted in the dorsal region of rats was collected over a 1-week period. A rapid and simple staining procedure based on the spectral properties of the bisbenzemide Hoechst 33342 was used to identify apoptotic PMN cells. Quantification of permeabilized PMN cells stained by propidium iodide was possible in the same unfixed specimens. The percentages of apoptotic and permeabilized PMN cells in peripheral rat blood were low (1.8 +/- 0.5% and 1.7 +/- 0.7%, respectively), similar to results found in humans. In exudates generated by polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the percentages of apoptotic and permeabilized PMN cells were higher than in the blood. The percentage of PMN cells undergoing apoptosis progressively increased with time and reached a maximum at day 2 (27% +/- 6%). The percentage of permeabilized cells progressively increased with time and was much higher than the percentage of apoptotic cells on days 4 and 8. Apoptosis and necrosis of PMN cells at day 2 were inhibited when tubes were filled with 10% serum. Selective inhibition of apoptosis with a caspase inhibitor in vivo indicated that apoptosis and necrosis are two separate pathways leading to the death of PMN cells in the exudate. At day 2, polyurethane (PU) was associated with a lower rate of apoptosis than PVC or a random copolymer of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and epsilon caprolactone (ECL). Apoptosis was interpreted as an organized cell removal process that limits inflammation. Apoptosis was the natural route of PMN cell death at the early stage of inflammation.

These polymers consist of a core-shell structure that resembles conventional micellar structures but with significant thermodynamic stability in aqueous media. The core of the polymers provide a hydrophobic environment for drug encapsulation via hydrophobic interactions, whereas the shell provides excellent water solubility. The polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and mass spectroscopies, as well as gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric and elemental analyses. Encapsulation ability was measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography to monitor Lidocaine, a hydrophobic molecule. Encapsulation capabilities increased as lipophilicity of the core increased.

The results indicated that these unimolecular micelles have great potential as drug carriers.

Several studies suggest, however, that the conformation or orientation of immobilized fibrinogen rather than the total amount adsorbed plays an important role in determining the blood compatibility of biomaterials. The purpose of this study was to investigate time-dependent functional changes in fibrinogen adsorbed to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene (PE), and silicone rubber (SR). Fibrinogen was adsorbed to these materials for 1 min and then allowed to ""reside"" on the surfaces for up to 2 h prior to assessing its biological activity. Changes in fibrinogen reactivity were determined by measuring the adhesion of Cr-51-labeled platelets, the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against an important functional region of the fibrinogen molecule (the gamma-chain dodecapeptide sequence 400-411), and the ability of blood plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion differed among the polymeric materials studied, and PTFE and PE samples exhibited a small decrease in adhesion with increasing fibrinogen residence time. Platelet adhesion to SR was the least among all materials studied and showed no variation with residence time. When using PTFE and SR as substrates, mAb recognition of adsorbed fibrinogen did not change with residence time whereas that on PE decreased slightly. The mAb binding was least to fibrinogen adsorbed to SR, which is in agreement with the platelet adhesion results. Finally, the ability of plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen decreased dramatically with increasing residence time on all materials. These in vitro studies support the hypothesis that fibrinogen undergoes biologically significant conformational changes upon adsorption to polymeric biomaterials, a phenomenon that may contribute to the hemocompatibility of the materials following implantation in the body.

Segments of different types of suture with adherent bacteria were implanted subcutaneously into mice. The infection risk with Staphylococcus aureus was greater than with Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A or Candida albicans. The infection risk with the implantation of multifilament sutures was significantly greater than with monofilament sutures. When <10 colony forming units (cfu) of S. aureus were present on monofilament suture material, the infection rate was 3%. When <10 cfu of S. aureus were present on multifilament suture material, the infection rate was 7%. An infection rate of 15% occurred with <10 cfu of S. aureus on multifilament nylon sutures. When >10 but <20 cfu of S. aureus were present, the infection rates were 4 and 51%, respectively. These data confirm that the infection rate with multifilament sutures (or porous materials) is greater than with monofilament sutures (or solid materials) when the organisms are encountered at implantation (acute model) and indicate that a significant risk of infection may occur when only a few organisms are on a device at implantation.

We had hypothesized that material-induced neutrophil activation was an important parameter associated with material failure. All materials tested [cellophane, an acrylonitrile copolymer (AN69), Pellethane(TM) nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, low density polyethylene, and polydimethylsiloxane] activated isolated human neutrophils, which were resuspended in plasma or serum, to similar extents based on L-selectin shedding, CD11b upregulation, and stimulation of the oxidative burst after 30-min exposure. Inhibition of complement activation by sCR1 unexpectedly had Little effect if any on nonadherent neutrophils. However, neutrophil adhesion, but not the level of activation of the adherent cells, was strongly dependent on complement activation. Pretreatment with albumin did not inhibit adhesion or reduce neutrophil activation, but plasma pretreatment resulted in increased activation for nonadherent and adherent cells. More adhesion and a higher level of activation of adherent cells was observed following pretreatment with fibrinogen, a ligand of CD11b. Taken together these results suggest that upon contact with a material, neutrophil activation may occur though mechanisms that are not mediated by complement. For example, the presence of plasma proteins such as fibrinogen at the interface may trigger activation and the release of other activating agents. Although the material differences are small, the extent of activation may be significant and warrant further study of the mechanism and consequences of that activation.

In a recent study we found impaired fibronectin receptor function on hydrophobic substrata (G. Altankov et al. J Biomater Sci Polym Edn 1997;8:712-740). Here, we have studied the distribution and function of the vitronectin receptor (alpha(v) integrin) in fibroblasts adhering on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyl glass (ODS). The morphology of fibroblasts and the organization of actin cytoskeleton were studied and found to be altered on ODS, where the cells did not spread and possessed condensed actin. Pretreatment of the surfaces with serum or pure vitronectin improved cell morphology on both substrata, resulting in the development of longitudinal actin stress fibers. It was found with biotinylated vitronectin that comparable quantities of vitronectin were adsorbed from single vitronectin solutions or serum on glass and on hydrophobic ODS. The organization of the vitronectin receptors on the ventral cell surface was investigated in permeabilized cells showing normal focal adhesions in fibroblasts plated on glass but none of these structures on ODS. The distribution of alpha(v) integrin on the dorsal cell surface was studied on nonpermeabilized living cells after antibody tagging. While fibroblasts adhering on plain or serum-treated glass developed a Linear organization of alpha(v) integrin, cells on plain and serum-treated ODS were not able to reorganize the vitronectin receptor. Studies on signal transduction with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed co-localization of alpha(v) integrin and phosphotyrosine in focal adhesions on glass and serum-treated glass. However, signaling was almost absent on plain ODS and weak on serum-treated ODS. It was concluded that alterations in vitronectin receptor function on the ventral cell surface caused by the hydrophobic material surface inhibit signal transfer and subsequent intracellular events that are important for the organization and function of integrins.

To decrease the complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass, novel biomaterials have been introduced that may be less thrombogenic than standard synthetic surfaces. Methods. Thirty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to bypass using either a control circuit or a circuit prepared ""tip-to-tip"" with a triblock-copolymer (polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone). Results. There was a progressive increase in thrombin generation in the control group during bypass, which was not seen in the test group. The test surface decreased the release of tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complex formation (p < 0.005). There was also an increased platelet count and a decreased platelet activation in the test group, as detected by GMP-140 expression and beta-thromboglobulin release (p = 0.017). There was also significantly more debris that accumulated on the arterial filter in the control group, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Conclusions. This clinical trial has demonstrated a significant difference in the hematologic effects of the test circuits, with evidence of platelet preservation, decreased fibrinolysis, and decreased thrombin generation. A larger trial would be necessary to establish the clinical relevance of these differences.

Factors that govern bone cell, ie osteoblast, adhesion and ECM elaboration significantly influence its re-modeling into mature bone, and ultimately its ability to integrate with biomaterials used for orthopedic prostheses. Ln this study we have investigated how treatment with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that promotes ectopic bone formation, modulates the organization and expression of osteoblastic cell proteins. Specifically, we analyzed how BMP-2 treatment affects cytoskeletal components, ECM, and alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin receptor subunits in osteoblastic cells plated on Ti6Al4V, a titanium alloy widely used for orthopedic implants that interacts with bone cells in vitro and in vivo. Osteoblastic cells were pre-treated with BMP-2 for 12 h prior to plating; BMP-2 treatment stimulated adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells and this adhesive advantage was reflected in enhanced long-term matrix mineralization in the BMP-2 pretreated cultures. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis of BMP-2 treated cells showed that enhanced cytoskeletal organization and focal contact formation occurred. These changes were accompanied by a concomitant increase in the spatial organization of fibronectin, whereas vitronectin, collagen type I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin showed little change. The changes in ECM organization correlated with increased fibronectin, alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin subunit, and focal adhesion kinase (p125(FAK)) expression, as well as increased p125(FAK) phosphorylation. By confocal microscopy, the alpha 5 integrin subunit was more concentrated in lamellipodia after BMP-2 treatment. These results demonstrate that BMP-2 significantly altered osteoblastic cytoskeletal and ECM organization and enhanced expression of fibronectin and of specific integrin receptor subunits, with concomitant changes in the levels and phosphorylation of p125(FAK). These effects may contribute to downstream cellular responses important for bone cell function, and growth.

A water uptake ability test, in vitro drug release and collagenase degradation tests, and an in vivo animal test were employed to confirm the applicability of this gelatin-alginate sponge as a wound dressing material. As the alginate content in the sponge increased, the porosity increased, resulting in an enhanced water uptake ability. Sponges loaded with silver sulfadiazine or gentamicin sulfate slowly released drugs for up to four days. The crosslinked sponge resisted in vitro collagenase digestion for up to three days.

The present study was aimed at reconstruction of abdominal wall muscle using processed dermal sheep collagen (DSC) and myoblast seeding. Myoblasts were harvested from foetal quadriceps muscle of an inbred rat strain, cultured, seeded as non-differentiated cells into DSC-discs and incubated in vitro for 2 h. The discs were implanted in the abdominal wall defects in adult rats. Non-seeded discs functioned as control. Implantation periods till week 6 were chosen. At day 1 and 2 after implantation infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages was clearly more intense in the seeded discs than in the controls. Relatively large numbers of mast cells infiltrated from the side of the adhering omentum. In central areas of the discs, seeded cells were easily recognized till day 5, since non-seeded control discs did not contain such cells. Ingrowth of host cells and tissue at the margins proceeded faster with the seeded discs. Lymphocyte accumulations were observed in the 3 week seeded specimen. At week 3 and week 6, in the seeded discs muscle tissue was not present, in contrast to very large giant-like cells. It is concluded that the chosen method of myoblast seeding did not result in the regeneration of muscle during this observation period. Unfavorable circumstances such as humoral factors, direct cellular interactions (phagocytosis), indirect cellular interactions (cytokines), or initial absence of vascularization, may play a role. Further studies are required. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aim of this work was to study the in vitro toxicity of solutions of these radio-opacifiers using two cell culture models. Primary-cultures of human urothelial cells (HUC) arising from normal adult urinary tract and permanent urothelial cell line were used. Solutions at different dilutions were placed into the wells containing monolayers of confluent cells. After 24 h incubation period, the solutions were removed and cell viability and cell metabolic activity tests were performed (Neutral Red assay and MTT assay). At a concentration lower than 1 mg 1(-1) the different radio-opacifiers used showed no toxicity. From 1 to 3 mg 1(-1) one can note a significant dose-dependent decrease of cell metabolic activity of solely HUC for barium chloride. At 3 mg 1(-1) one can note a significant deleterious effect on HUC metabolic activity, with bismuth and tantale. For tungsten, there is no deleterious effect, but on the contrary a significant increase in HUC metabolic activity at a 0.5 mg 1(-1) concentration. None of the solutions did provoke alterations in HUC viability for concentrations less than 3 mg 1(-1). Interestingly, for permanent cell line one can note a solely significant decrease of cell viability at 3 mg 1(-1) for tantale. All the other tested salts on permanent cell line were not significantly different from controls for cell viability as well as cell metabolic activity.

A number of cross-linking methods have been tested in biological tissues composed mainly of collagen. The basis for most of them is the use of glutaraldehyde (GA), which acts on the Lys or Hyl residues. We have studied the effects of alternative chemical treatments: diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) and ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDAC). Their mechanism of action is based on the activation of the carboxyl groups, which then permits their cross-linking to amino groups. As a control, we employed conventional treatment with GA, applying it to bovine pericardium and collagen membranes removed from bovine pericardium. The analysis of the Lys and Hyl residues showed that DPPA and EDAC produced 50% of the chemical change provoked by GA. This value was even lower in the trials with collagen. In terms of the resistance to collagenase degradation, chemical cross-linking with GA provided much greater protection in both materials (3.81 +/- 3.47 nmol of amino acid/mg dry tissue for pericardium and 4.41 +/- 1.13 nmol of amino acid/mg dry tissue for collagen). Treatment with DPPA also protected pericardium (13.11 +/- 6.57 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue) although the values for collagen was lower (50.0 +/- 32.4 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue).Treatment with EDAC was much less protective than the other two chemical reagents (43.28 +/- 17.4 and 55.85 +/- 14.57 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue for pericardium and collagen, respectively). The degree of tissue calcification after implantation of the chemically treated materials into young rats was considerably greater for GA and DPPA (32.9 +/- 18.8 and 36.3 +/- 13.3 mg g(-1) dry tissue, respectively) than with EDAC (18.0 +/- 7.2 mg g(-1) dry tissue; P < 0.001). After 60 days of implantation, the values for GA and EDAC were higher (124.1 +/- 31.3 and 124.6 +/- 21.0 mg g(-1) dry tissue, respectively) versus 34.6 +/- 19.2 mg g(-1) dry tissue for DPPA. There were no significant differences in collagen levels in samples treated with GA or EDAC after 30 days of implantation, although both groups showed significant differences when compared with DPPA-treated samples (P < 0.001). After 60 days of implantation, there were no significant differences among these three treatments in terms of the calcium accumulated on samples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is well established that after implantation that proteins will be adsorbed on to the surface of biomaterials and may then influence the development of surface mineralised layers. Hydroxyapatite was synthesised by wet method and electrophoretically deposited over 316L stainless steel at optimised coating parameters.

The polymers coated are silicone and polyethylene, and the effect on the friction coefficient is studied. Film adhesion is found to depend on the DLC film refractive index (n), whereas the friction is largely independent of kn in the range studied. Films were deposited from a He/C2H2 mixture at 20 Pa (0.15 Torr) on to the polymer substrates placed on a 10-cm-diameter electrode driven at 13.56 MHz. Film growth was monitored by in-situ ellipsometry (at 675 nm), which was performed on a glass slide placed near the polymer substrate. Friction measurements were obtained using a pin-on-disk tribometer, and measurements were carried out using a stainless-steel pin at a linear speed of 6 cm s(-1) Film adhesion was evaluated using a pull-adhesion tester. It was found that DLC coatings adhere well to the polymer substrates and can significantly reduce the friction coefficient of polymers such as silicone. Higher refractive index films (which are harder and have a higher mechanical strength) were found to have a poorer adhesion and provide a slightly increased friction on the polymer surface when compared to lower-index films. This study indicates that DLC may be used to enhance the tribological properties of polymers with potential applications in the biomaterials and light-engineering industries.

Since the nature of bone cell responses in vitro is influenced by the properties of HA ceramics, this study was divided into 2 components: a chemical and crystallographic characterization of the HA ceramics, and an in vitro cell culture study. Sintered HA samples were observed to have the highest crystallite size, compared to as-received HA and calcined HA samples. No differences in surface roughness and chemical composition were observed between the sintered, calcined, and as-received HA surfaces. In concurrence with the x-ray diffraction, high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Ca 2p also indicated a higher crystallinity on sintered HA samples compared to calcined and as-received HA samples. Protein production by osteoblast cells was not statistically different on the 3 HA surfaces in the absence of TGF-beta. However, there was a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta-stimulated protein produc tion on the 3 different HA surfaces. As indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, as well as 1,25 (OH2) vitamin D-3-stimulated osteocalcin production, a more differentiated osteoblastlike phenotype was observed on the sintered HA surfaces compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA surfaces. An increased osteoblast-like cell activity on sintered HA surfaces in the presence of different TGF-beta dosage suggested that sintering of HA surfaces may play an important role in governing cellular response.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Biomat, Dept Restorat Mat, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Endodont, San Antonio, TX USA; CeraMed Corp, Lakewood, CO USA","Ong, JL (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Biomat, Dept Restorat Mat, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA.",,,,,,,45,15,17,0,3,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

In vitro adhesion of platelets on the PE was evaluated. The exposure of animals to stress induced a dramatic change in platelet morphology and functions on the PE: a higher degree of platelet adhesion, increased platelet spreading, and the appearance of pseudopodia, In the unstressed subjects there were no modifications of the platelets on the PE with respect to the baseline.

However, there is a possibility that these materials are responsible for an unwanted inflammatory response during wound healing. Since TCP is soluble in the body, the instability of this material may contribute to this inflammatory response. Using composite ceramics of TCP and HAP that possessed Ca/P molar ratios of 1.50, 1.55, 1.60, 1.64, and 1.67, the effect of surface instability on fibroblast L-929 cells was investigated. The time-dependent variation of the initial anchoring ratio, cell density, and cell viability were measured. In general, the cells were severely damaged and ruptured on the highly soluble thin surface layer of the TCP-HAP ceramics. The initial anchoring ratio for TCP-HAP ceramics was as high as that for the polystyrene dish (Lux, control). However, viability at 6 h decreased to less than 50% of the initial cell density on ceramics with a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.64 (20% TCP-80% MAP), while 85% of the cells were viable on Lux. The viability on 100% TCP, whose surface is the most highly soluble among the TCP-HAP ceramics used in this study, was reduced to 20%. Morphological observation showed that the anchored cells were ruptured when grown in culture medium on the 100% TCP. Although the high solubility of the thin surface layer on the TCP-HAP ceramics of the carrier was found to be the dominant factor in the decreasing cell viability, the initial viability was enhanced by the stabilization of the surface of the TCP-HAP ceramics by pre-incubating the scaffolds in a culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 d.","Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Chiba 2788510, Japan; Natl Ind Res Inst Nagoya, Bioceram Lab, Nagoya 4628510, Japan","Suzuki, T (reprint author), Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, 2641 Yamazaki, Chiba 2788510, Japan.",,"nagata, fukue/M-8449-2018; Nishizawa, Kaori/F-8655-2011","nagata, fukue/0000-0002-5284-9626; Nishizawa, Kaori/0000-0002-3143-1298",,,,41,30,30,0,2,SOC BIOSCIENCE BIOENGINEERING JAPAN,OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA, 565-0871, JAPAN",1389-1723,,,J BIOSCI BIOENG,J.

It describes how death, ageing, degeneration, pathology and individual variability influence the properties of natural tissues. Experimental problems arise from degradation and testing conditions; these are illustrated by the properties of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. Replacement of natural tissues by graft materials and the products of tissue engineering is then described. Synthetic replacement materials should be biocompatible, i.e. they should not cause adverse reactions in the human body. However, polymers which hydrolyse in the body fluids may be useful for implants which are intended to have a limited life or for controlled release of drugs. Synthetic implant materials may attempt to mimic natural tissues but there may be a problem of attaching them to the surrounding tissue, Artificial ligaments provide an example of implants of this kind. Total hip replacement is used to illustrate the successful use of conventional engineering materials, Finally, safety issues are described; an implant material must be biocompatible, have the required mechanical strength, be sterile and should be incorporated into a device so that its performance in the living patient can be monitored.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Aberdeen, Scotland","Hukins, DWL (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Aberdeen, Scotland.",d.hukins@biomed.abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,46,36,36,1,12,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0959-9428,1364-5501,,J MATER CHEM,J.

This in vivo implantation technique is used to test new materials as putative delivery vehicles in skeletal tissue-engineering models. HYAFF 11 and ACP sponges, two biomaterials based on hyaluronic acid modified by esterification of the carboxyl groups of the glucuronic acid, were tested as osteogenic or chondrogenic delivery vehicles for rabbit mesenchymal progenitor cells and compared with a well characterized porous calcium phosphate ceramic delivery vehicle. The implant materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy for differences in pore structure or cellular interactions, were quantified for their ability to bind and retain mesenchymal progenitor cells, and were examined histologically for their ability to support osteogene sis and chondrogenesis after subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. The ACP sponge bound the same number of cells as fibronectin-coated ceramic, whereas the HYAFF 11 sponge bound 90% more. When coated with fibronectin, ACP and HYAFF 11 bound, respectively, 100 and 130% more cells than the coated ceramics. HYAFF 11 sponge composites retained their integrity after the 3 or B-week incubation period in the animals and were processed for histomorphometric analysis. As a result of rapid degradation or resorption in vivo, ACP sponges could not be recovered after implantation and could not be analyzed. HYAFF 11 sponges presented more area available for cell attachment and more available volume for newly formed tissue. Following loading with mesenchymal progenitor cells and implantation, the pores of the sponges contained more bone and cartilage than the pores of ceramic cubes at either time point. Thus, relative to ceramic, HYAFF 11 sponges allow incorporation of twice as many cells and produce a 30% increase in the relative amount of bone and cartilage per unit area. Hence, the hyaluronic acid-based delivery vehicles are superior to porous calcium phosphate ceramic with respect to the number of cells loaded per unit volume of implant, and HYAFF 11 sponges are superior to the ceramics with regard to the amount of bone and cartilage formed. Additionally, hyaluronic acid-based vehicles have the advantage of degradation/resorption characteristics that allow complete replacement of the implant with newly formed tissue.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Caplan, AI (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, 2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,"Sano, Michael/E-1715-2011","Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,35,298,310,2,65,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Three kinds of surface conditions of amorphous alloys were prepared: as-received (by single roller melt spinning method), polished and just-polished (within 300 s after polishing). Polished crystalline alloys were also polarized as controls. I-corr (corrosion current density) and I-crit (critical passive current density) of the as-received amorphous alloys and the polished crystalline alloys decreased with increasing chromium content. Corrosion resistance of these alloys was improved by the addition of chromium. I-corr, I-crit and I-ps (passivation current density) of the polished amorphous alloys were lower than those of the polished crystalline alloys and these values of the former alloys were independent of chromium content. This indicates that corrosion resistance of the polished amorphous alloys is higher in the artificial body fluid than that of the polished crystalline alloys. To determine the cathodic reactant on the as-received amorphous alloys in deaerated PBS(-), one of the alloys was polarized in deaerated 2.5 kmol%H2SO4. The cathodic Tafel slope in PBS(-) was the same as that in H2SO4, indicating that the cathodic reactant in PBS(-) was identified as hydrogen ion. Ln addition, polarization curves of pure palladium, pure copper and pure chromium were examined to determine the anodic reaction. E-corr (corrosion potential) of the pure palladium was similar to those of the alloys, suggesting that palladium ion is preferentially released from the alloys under the immersion in deaerated PBS(-). I-corr, and I-crit of the polished amorphous alloys were lower than those of the as-received amorphous alloys. To discuss the improvement in corrosion resistance by polishing, just-polished alloys were also polarized. The curves of the as-received and the just-polished alloys contained negative loop except the polished alloys. I-corr and I-crit of the just-polished alloys were slightly larger than those of the polished alloys. These results indicate that the surface morphology of the amorphous alloys changed during the exposure to air, causing the increase in corrosion resistance.","Natl Res Inst Met, Sci & Technol Agcy, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hiromoto, S (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Met, Sci & Technol Agcy, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"BAI, JIE/D-7448-2016; HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011",,,,,9,9,9,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",0021-4876,1880-6880,,J JPN I MET,J.

In the grafting of GMA onto PP fabric, the degree of grafting (%) increased with an increase in reaction time, reaction temperature, and pre-irradiation dose. The maximum grafting yield was observed around 60 % CMA concentration. In 50, 130 and 250 % GMA-grafted PP fabric, the content of phosphoric acid was 1.52, 3.40 and 4.50 mmol/g at 80 degrees C in the 85 % phosphoric acid aqueous solution for 24 h, respectively.

A single wheat grain with a known amount of moisture was placed on the MRR at two different orientations (0 degrees and 90 degrees) with respect to the feedline. The resonance frequency (f(r)), bandwidth (B) and quality factor (Q(r)) of the MRR were calibrated against the moisture content. The measurements were made with a scalar network analyser. The sensor was studied in the normal useful moisture range of 11-32% (on a wet-weight basis), the actual moisture values being obtained by an oven-drying method. The 0 degrees orientation was more sensitive to moisture than was the 90 degrees orientation. The total changes in f(r) for a 21% change in moisture content for 0 degrees and 90 degrees orientations were 235 and 150 MHz, respectively. The errors in moisture estimation with f(r) for 0 degrees and 90 degrees were +/-2.06% and +/-2.09%, respectively. The corresponding values with B and Q(r) for 90 degrees orientation were +/-2.14% and +/-2.19%, respectively. The proposed sensor is more sensitive than a reported waveguide resonator and is easy to operate, for the microstrip offers an open structure, thereby facilitating easy loading and unloading of the samples.","Univ Pune, Dept Phys, RCMF Transducer Lab, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Abegaonkar, MP (reprint author), Univ Pune, Dept Phys, RCMF Transducer Lab, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",rca@physics.unipune.ernet.in,,,,,,18,27,29,0,7,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0957-0233,1361-6501,,MEAS SCI TECHNOL,Meas.

The goal of the reported studies was to investigate the effect of fluid flow on the morphology, phagocytic function and stress response induction in adherent immune cells. Shear approximating arterial, venous and intermediate levels were applied onto glass-adherent IC21 macrophages in a temperature-controlled parallel plate flow system. The results indicate that fluid flow induces a shear-dependent physiological stress response in adherent macrophages and that significant morphological changes accompany macrophage responses to shear stress. In addition, arterial flow conditions induce not only significant cell polarisation, but also enhanced phagocytic ingestion in glass-adherent IC21 macrophages. These findings suggest that blood flow induced shear stress may not only be consequent to adherent leukocyte activation, but may also be integral to the regulation of adherent leukocyte behaviour in vivo.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Moghe, PV (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",,,,,,,45,7,7,0,5,PETER PEREGRINUS LTD,HERTS,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE, SIX HILLS WAY, STEVANAGE, HERTS SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",0140-0118,,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

In the second step, a positive replica is made from the first using a solution of polystyrene or polyurethane to coat the methacrylate cast. The resulting replica is removed from the methacrylate cast. Results indicate the highest level of spatial resolution is obtained using a modified Murakami resin for the negative cast and polystyrene for the positive replica. The 29-nm-wide repeat banding structure present on collagen fibrils could be clearly identified in both the methacrylate cast and in the polystyrene positive replica of the methacrylate cast. Thus high-resolution replicas can be obtained.

Bubble collapse in liquids results in an enormous concentration of energy from the conversion of the kinetic energy of liquid motion into heating of the contents of the bubble. The high local temperatures and pressures, combined with extraordinarily rapid cooling, provide a unique means for driving chemical reactions under extreme conditions. A diverse set of applications of ultrasound to enhance chemical reactivity has been explored, with important applications in mixed-phase synthesis, materials chemistry, and biomedical uses. For example, the sonochemical decomposition of volatile organometallic precursors in low-volatility solvents produces nanostructured materials in various forms with high catalytic activities. Nanostructured metals, alloys, carbides and sulphides, nanometre colloids, and nanostructured supported catalysts can all be prepared by this general route. Another important application of sonochemistry to materials chemistry has been the preparation of biomaterials, most notably protein microspheres. Such microspheres have a wide range of biomedical applications, including their use as echo contrast agents for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, and oxygen or drug delivery.","Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,"Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011; Hyeon, Taeghwan/J-5315-2012","Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701; Lee, Junyoung/0000-0001-6689-2759",,,,64,402,406,3,88,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Water-soluble synthetic polymers have also been crosslinked with molecules of biological origin, such as oligopeptides(13) and oligodeoxyribonudeotides(14), or with intact native proteins(15). Very often there are several factors influencing the relationship between structure and properties in these systems, making it difficult to engineer hydrogels with specified responses to particular stimuli. Here we report a hybrid hydrogel system assembled from water-soluble synthetic polymers and a well-defined protein-folding motif, the coiled coil. These hydrogels undergo temperature-induced collapse owing to the cooperative conformational transition of the coiled-coil protein domain.

A major objective of the workshop was to examine the emerging connections between macromolecular science and other areas of science and engineering, and identify exciting areas of opportunity in this context for the next decade. A second objective was to consider what approaches NSF could use to optimize, through research and education, the development of interdisciplinary MMSE. In the fall of 1996 Andrew Lovinger approached Prof. S.I. Stupp to chair the workshop and form an organizing committee. The first step was to solicit opinions from the community at. large on what directions were perceived to be important and exciting. Based on input from the community, five discussion groups for the workshop covering the following themes: novel macromolecular structures : synthesis and function; control of properties through innovative processing; solving environmental problems with macromolecular science and engineering; macromolecular science connections between the physical and biological sciences; and translating macromolecular discoveries into technologies. The selection of these particular topics for the workshop was nor meant to exclude the vast number of other areas in macromolecular science and engineering that are scientifically and technically important. The topics of the workshop were selected because they were identified as exciting areas of opportunity with a high interdisciplinary content. The content of recommendations made by each discussion group varies; some emphasized research directions and others educational issues or funding procedures. These differences reflect the nature of each topic and also the specific concerns of individuals in the discussion group.","Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SOC FRANCAISE CHIMIE,PARIS,"250 RUE SAINT-JACQUES, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE",0151-9093,,,ACTUAL CHIMIQUE,Actual Chim.,FEB,1999.0,,2,,,,,3,5,,,,,,3,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,176WK,WOS:000079174900002,,,,,2019-02-25

Methods: Similar-sized endplates made of 3 different biomaterials were sutured to the sclera in the superotemporal quadrant of the rabbit eye. Thirty eyes of 15 albino New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to the 3 groups. Conjunctival vascular hyperemia was graded in a masked fashion among groups. At the end of 3 weeks, the enucleated eyes were examined histologically and using scanning electron microscopy. Results: Polypropylene and Vivathane were associated with significantly more inflammation in clinical observations and based on histological grading. Silicone was associated with the least amount of inflammation. Three polypropylene and 1 Vivathane plate were extruded between the second and third week. Conclusions: Silicone is the most inert of the 3 materials tested. Inflammation associated with biomaterials may contribute to the failure of the glaucoma drainage devices. Clinical Relevance: Bleb inflammation may be related to the biomaterial being used as the endplate. Endplates should be handled carefully during surgery to avoid creating rough spots.","Watson Clin, Dept Ophthalmol, Lakeland, FL USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Surg, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Ophthalmol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Pathol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Ayyala, RS (reprint author), 12901 Bruce B Downs Blvd,MDC 21, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",,,"Haller, Edward/0000-0002-8535-2181",,,,10,68,71,1,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0003-9950,,,ARCH OPHTHALMOL-CHIC,Arch.

Subcutaneous sites lack adequate vascularization to nutritionally support transplanted hepatocytes. We recently reported that matrix-immobilized angiogenic growth factors, e.g., endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), can induce a high degree of neovascularization. Using this technique, we explored the possibility of transplanting isolated fetal porcine hepatocytes to create liver tissue organoids at a specific subcutaneous site. We evaluated chitosan as a scaffold biomaterial because of its structural similarity to glycosaminoglycans; glycosaminoglycans play a critical role in cell attachment, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Freshly isolated fetal porcine hepatocytes (FPH) (viability greater than 97%) were cultured on modified chitosan scaffolds and transplanted into rat groin fat pads with or without ECGF-induced neovascularization. Cell density and attachment kinetics on chitosan were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified using a flavianic acid binding assay. Hepatocyte viability and liver organoid formation were examined immunohistochemically. FPH transplanted without prior neovascularization died within 1 day posttransplantation. When transplanted after ECGF-induced neovascularization, FPH thrived for at least 2 weeks and formed liver tissue like structures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of hepatocyte-specific cytokeratin staining as well as the presence of alpha-fetoprotein. Light microscopy and SEM revealed that FPH did not change their morphology after attachment to the chitosan surfaces. Thus, chitosan-based biomaterial surfaces have good hepatocyte attachment properties, However, extensive neovascularization is essential for hepatocyte survival and organoid formation. In the future, chitosan-based biomaterials may be useful as scaffolds for creating liver tissue organoids.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Liver Biosupport & Hepatitis Res Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Ankara Univ, Dept Chem, Ankara, Turkey","Dixit, V (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Liver Biosupport & Hepatitis Res Lab, 675 Circle Dr S,MRL Room 1240, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,"Elcin, Yasar Murat/0000-0003-1037-0825",,,,25,49,58,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Saos-2 cells were plated on Tivanium (Tiv, Ti-6Al-4V), Zimaloy (Zim, Co-Cr-Mo) and glass disks. The cells were cultured in a-TviEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg ml( )(-1) ascorbic acid. The cultures were analyzed for calcification and for mRNA expression for ECM proteins after 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Calcium content was significantly higher in cells on Tiv, less on Zim and least on glass disks. With the addition of 3 mM b-glycerophosphate (b-GP), the cell layer was more calcified on Zim than on Tiv and all substrates had three times more calcium than cultures without b-GP. All subsequent experiments were performed without b-GP. Phalloidin immunofluorescence microscopy of the actin-based cytoskeleton at 2 weeks demonstrated nodules composed of multilayered, cobblestone-appearing osteoblasts overlying calcified matrix which was stained with calcein. On Tiv, calcified nodules were connected in a trabecular-like pattern while on Zim, calcification was dispersed throughout the cell layer. Northern blots for alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and al(I) procollagen mRNAs were performed at different time points. The amount and pattern of calcification as well as the expression of ECM-mRNAs differed on each implant material. The results indicate that Tiv stimulates the production of more ECM proteins and mineralized matrix than Zim or glass in this osteoblast-like cell/implant culture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Antibiotic bonding was obtained by soaking the meshes for 15 min in a solution containing 20 mg ml(-1) rifampicin or 10 mg ml(-1) of vancomycin or gentamicin. A polymer mesh was implanted in a subcutaneous pouch in 16 rabbits: four received a rifampicin-soaked mesh, four received a vancomycin-soaked mesh, four received a gentamicin-soaked mesh, and four received an untreated mesh (control group). At the time of implantation, all the meshes were contaminated locally with 10(8) colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. Meshes were harvested one week later and submitted to bacterial counts. At the time of explantation, none of the antibiotic-soaked meshes were infected, whereas all the untreated meshes were infected. These results show that antibiotic soaking evidently prevents perioperative infection of gelatin-coated knitted polymer meshes in this model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The resulting polymers were random copolymers with weight average molecular weights from 40 000 to 200 000 dalton. Chemical structure and purity were confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectral analysis. General structure-property correlations were established. The glass transition temperature decreased with increasing PEG content and increasing pendent chain length. When higher molecular weight PEG blocks were used, the glass transition temperature increased relative to identical polymers having shorter PEG blocks. The tensile modulus increased with decreasing PEG content, decreasing pendent chain length, and when longer PEG blocks were used. Water uptake and the rate of backbone degradation increased with increasing PEG content. Microspheres could be prepared by solvent evaporation techniques from copolymers with low PEG content. Release rate of pNA and FITC-dextran from the microspheres increased with increasing PEG content. While tyrosine-derived polycarbonates were excellent substrates for cell attachment and growth, the presence of only 5 mol% of PEG(1000),, led to low or no cell attachment in short-term cell culture with both rat lung fibroblasts and osteoblasts.

Poly(DTE co 70%PEG(1000)( )carbonate) was chosen as an example to study this special phase transition behavior of the polymers. The observed transition temperature varied slightly depending on the technique used, e.g. CD always gave a lower temperature than UV/Vis. CD and UV/Vis studies indicated that the transition temperature was both heating rate and concentration dependent. Thermodynamic parameters of the transition (enthalpy, entropy, and free energy) were determined by DSC. The molecularity of the transition was 2.6, as calculated from UV and DSC data. The transition temperature could be varied from 18 to 58?C by changing the polymer structure.

Our study targeted the spreading behavior of human PMN adherent to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), pretreated with various plasma proteins, in response to the chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). To this end, a novel imaging configuration was developed to allow in situ reconstructive analysis of PMN 3-D morphology on opaque ePTFE surfaces, using optical sectioning confocal microscopy. Following fMLP stimulation, PMN morphological polarity was enhanced on all substrates studied except fibrinogen treated ePTFE. 3-D PMN morphometry revealed that in the absence of fMLP, overall cell spreading was minimized on albumin-treated ePTFE and maximized on fibrinogen and immunoglobulin-G-treated ePTFE. Following fMLP stimulation, overall PMN spreading increased markedly on untreated and albumin-coated ePTFE, while it stayed invariant on IgG and plasma treated ePTFE, and decreased on fibrinogen similar to treated ePTFE. Spatial analysis of PMN spreading following fMLP stimulation revealed enhanced PMN attachment on untreated and albumin treated ePTFE and diminished attachment on fibrinogen and plasma treated ePTFE. Thus, chemoattractant stimulation altered a wide range of PMN spreading attributes on ePTFE, including morphological polarity, substrate attachment, and 3-D membrane spreading, in a substrate dependent manner. These chemoattractant-induced spreading responses may also have important consequences for PMN phagocytosis. We report that fMLP stimulation led to enhanced unopsonized particulate phagocytosis on untreated and albumin treated ePTFE, but caused no discernible change in phagocytosis on other protein substrates. Thus, chemoattractant modulation of PMN spreading on ePTFE is highly substrate-regulated, and manifests in concerted effects on PMN phagocytosis. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used the MTT colorimetric test to assess cell viability and flow cytometry to evaluate cell proliferation. Tests were conducted at 24 and 72 h. Changes in cell morphology were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Positive (polyurethane) and negative (polystyrene) toxicity controls were included. The number of viable cells was significantly higher on polystyrene than on polyurethane. A decrease in the total number of cells from 24 to 72 h compared to the negative control was correlated with a lower percentage of S-phase cells. The differences in cell viability noted between the samples and the polystyrene control mainly resulted from an initial lack of adhesion, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The biocompatibility of the three silicone rubbers was comparable to the best of the three products currently being used. These results, combined with those of the previous study, indicate that silicone rubber could be considered for the manufacture of mouth guards. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, both STM and AFM require physical contact to the specimen. In the case of STM, the specimen needs to be conducting as well. Here we introduce a new method for imaging biological materials through air or a suitable liquid using decaying or evanescent fields at the tip of a properly designed microwave resonator. This novel method involves the use of an evanescent microwave probe (EMP) and is capable of imaging a variety of non-uniformities in biological materials including conductivity, permittivity, and density variations. EMP is a non-contact and non-destructive sensor and it does not require conducting specimens. Its spatial resolution is currently around 0.4 mu m m at 1 GHz. We have used this probe to map non-uniformities in a variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and biological and botanical samples.

Each polypeptide chain of collagen is composed of repeats of the sequence: Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are often L-proline (Pro) and 4(R)-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) residues, respectively. These chains are wound into tight triple helices of great stability, The hydroxyl group of Hyp residues contributes much to this conformational stability. The existing paradigm is that this stability arises from interstrand hydrogen bonds mediated by bridging water molecules, This model was tested using chemical synthesis to replace Hyp residues with 4(R)-fluoro-L-proline (Flp) residues. The fluorine atom in Flp residues does not form hydrogen bonds but does elicit strong inductive effects, Results: Replacing the Hyp residues in collagen with Flp residues greatly increases triple-helical stability. The free energy contributed by the fluorine atom in Flp residues is twice that of the hydroxyl group in Hyp residues. The stability of the Flp-containing triple helix far exceeds that of any untemplated collagen mimic of similar size. Conclusions: Bridging water molecules contribute little to collagen stability. Rather, collagen stability relies on previously unappreciated inductive effects. Collagen mimics containing fluorine or other appropriate electron-withdrawing substituents could be the basis of new biomaterials for restorative therapies.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raines, RT (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Raines, Ronald/A-5009-2013","Raines, Ronald/0000-0001-7164-1719",NIAMS NIH HHS [AR44276],,,71,197,200,3,23,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",1074-5521,,,CHEM BIOL,Chem.

Our results showed a good repair of the defects by bone regeneration (about 85% overall), high mineral density of new bone around the implants after 5 months, and steady state deposition processes. These results in GBR, without filling material, appear very promising for implantology and reconstructive odontostomatology practice.","Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Umana & Ereditaria, Sez Anat Patol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; Studio Odontol Associato, Milan, Italy; Univ Modena, Dipartimento Sci Morfol & Med Legali, Sez Anat Umana, I-41100 Modena, Italy","Botticelli, AR (reprint author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Umana & Ereditaria, Sez Anat Patol, Via Forlanini 14, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",,"Zaffe, Davide/G-1181-2016","Zaffe, Davide/0000-0003-1241-385X",,,,28,17,18,0,1,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0905-7161,,,CLIN ORAL IMPLAN RES,Clin.

Design: Animal study. Setting: School of medicine, Spain. Material: 48 New Zealand white rabbits divided into 4 groups of 12 each. Interventions: Full thickness defects 50 x 70 mm were created in the abdominal wall and repaired with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Soft Tissue Patch(R)), one of two polypropylene patches (Marlex(R) and Prolene(R)), or lyophylised dura mater (LyoDura(R)). 3 animals from each group were killed at 14, 30, 60 and 90 days and specimens examined by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and immune histochemistry by labelling of macrophages with RAM-11, a specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Main outcome measures: Infection, healing, development of adhesions, and histological appearance of the interface. Results: Tissues responded similarly to materials of similar structures. Layered prostheses (PTFE and Lyo-Dura(R)) caused formation of a well organised neoperitoneum with few adhesions to the abdominal viscera (loose adhesions in. animals in each group), whereas the mesh prostheses generated a disorganised neoperitoneum with many adhesions (Marlex(R) loose adhesions 3, firm 8, and integrated 1; Prolene(R) loose adhesions 2, firm 8, and integrated 2). Lyo-Dura(R) was associated with the formation of areas of calcification. Labelling of macrophages with the MoAb showed that they were in direct contact with all materials studied. Conclusions: Layered biomaterials with Little or no porosity (PTFE and Lyo-Dura(R)) are the most suitable of the four for implantation in sites where the prosthesis is in contact with the visceral peritoneum, because they induce minimal adhesions.","Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Madrid 28871, Spain","Bellon, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Crta Madrid Barcelona,Km 33600, Madrid 28871, Spain.",,,"PASCUAL, GEMMA/0000-0002-1623-4384; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,19,31,33,0,2,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Analysis was carried out using on-line flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and off-line flash (vacuum) pyrolysis followed by GC/MS. Standard samples of hexoses, pentoses, deoxyhexoses, lactose, cellulose and starch were treated with 25% aqueous TMAH (100 times excess by weight). Approximately 50 mu g (for on-line analysis) or 250 mu g (for off-line analysis) of the carbohydrate/TMAH mixture was heated to 700 degrees C (10 s) using a quartz holder and a CDS pyroprobe, From electron and chemical impact mass spectral data, and, from literature on alkaline decomposition of carbohydrates, tentative structures of unique products and the mechanisms of their formation are proposed. A series of permethylated deoxy aldonic acids are tentatively identified as key products. It is postulated that these 'saccharinic acids' are initially formed from the action of alkali on reducing sugars which are then subsequently methylated. In addition, thermochemolytic analysis of lactose, cellulose and starch afforded their own unique permethylated deoxy aldonic acids as well producing methoxy benzene products, i.e. 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, 2,4-dimethoxyphenol. It is believed that glycosidically-linked saccharides initially degrade under alkaline conditions similar to the so-called 'peeling reaction' observed for cellulose under alkaline pulping conditions and then are finally methylated. An algal sample has been analyzed for its carbohydrate composition. The observation of hexose, pentose and polysaccharide thermochemolysis products illustrate the potential of the method to characterize the saccharide composition of more complex biomaterials.

Flow cell studies of the interaction between bacteria and surfaces do not generally allow direct comparison of different materials using the same bacterial suspension. The use of a modified Robbins Device (MRD) to compare the adhesion to different surfaces of Staph. epidermidis RP62A grown in continuous culture was investigated. Adhesion to glass was compared with siliconized glass, plasma-conditioned glass, titanium, stainless steel and Teflon. Attachment to siliconized glass was also compared with glass under differing ionic strength, and divalent cation concentrations. Both the differences in numbers adhering and changes in adhesion (slope) through the MRD were compared. There was a trend towards higher numbers adhering to the discs at the in-flow end of the MRD than at the outflow end, probably reflecting depletion of adherent bacteria in the interacting stream. Adhesion of Staph. epidermidis RP62A to siliconized glass and Teflon was reduced when compared to glass with increasing flow rates. Adhesion to stainless steel nias not affected by flow rate and titanium gave a different slope of adhesion through the MRD when compared with glass, suggesting an interaction with different sub-populations within the interacting stream. Differences between siliconized glass and glass at flow rates of 300 mi h(-1) were abolished by the addition of calcium or EDTA and reduced by the addition of magnesium. Increasing ionic strength reduced the statistical significance of the differences between glass and siliconized glass, Pre-conditioning of glass with pooled human plasma reduced adhesion compared with untreated glass and again gave a different slope to glass. The MRD linked to a chemostat call be used to compare directly bacterial adhesion to potential biomaterials. Variable depiction of the interacting stream should be taken into account in the interpretation of results. Divalent cation concentration, substrate properties and flow rate were important determinants of the comparative adhesion of Staph. epidermidiss RP62A to surfaces.","Univ Bristol, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England; Univ Bristol, Dept Paediat Epidemiol, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England","Millar, MR (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Royal Infirm, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Level 8,Marlborough St, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England.",,,"sherriff, andrea/0000-0002-1016-037X",,,,33,15,15,0,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-5072,,,J APPL MICROBIOL,J.

Microfabrication techniques have enabled the production of precisely controlled surface topographies that have been used as substrata for cells in culture and on devices implanted in vivo. This article reviews aspects of cell behavior involved in tissue response to implants with an emphasis on the effects of topography. Microfabricated grooved surfaces produce orientation and directed locomotion of epithelial cells in vitro and can inhibit epithelial downgrowth on implants. The effects depend on the groove dimensions and they are modified by epithelial cell-cell interactions. Fibroblasts similarly exhibit contact guidance on grooved surfaces, but fibroblast shape in vitro differs markedly from that found in vivo. Surface topography is important in establishing tissue organization adjacent to implants, with smooth surfaces generally being associated with fibrous tissue encapsulation. Grooved topographies appear to have promise in reducing encapsulation ii in the short term, but additional studies employing three-dimensional reconstruction and diverse topographies are needed to understand better the process of connective-tissue organization adjacent to implants. Microfabricated surfaces can increase the frequency of mineralized bone-like tissue nodules adjacent to subcutaneously implanted surfaces in rats. Orientation of these nodules with grooves occurs both in culture and on implants. Detailed comparisons of cell behavior on micromachined substrata in vitro and in vivo are difficult because of the number and complexity of factors, such as population density and micromotion, that cart differ between these conditions.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Med Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Brunette, DM (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Med Sci, 2199 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",,,,,,,62,250,251,5,46,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

In the present work, we have electrochemically synthesized composites comprising heparin and the electrically conducting polymer polypyrrole. The incorporation and exposure of heparin were controlled by varying key conditions of polymer synthesis (i.e., applied current and synthesis time). The resulting composite polymers were electroactive after synthesis and the amount of heparin exposed in the polymer could be increased (up to threefold) by switching the polymers from their oxidized to reduced states. Polymer reduction was achieved by either application of negative potentials (-0.4 to -0.7 V for 90 s) or exposure to aqueous reductant (0.1M sodium dithionite for 30 min). Heparin-polypyrrole composites remained stable after autoclaving, displaying no significant loss of electroactivity, and had a shelf life of at least 2 years postautoclaving. Finally, the composites were found to be excellent substrates for the growth of human endothelial cells.

Polystyrene was used as a model hydrophobic polymer; i.e., we expected that the role of fibrinogen in platelet adhesion to polystyrene would be representative of other hydrophobic polymers. Platelet adhesion was compared to both the amount and conformation of adsorbed fibrinogen. The strategy was to compare platelet adhesion to surfaces preadsorbed with normal, afibrinogenemic, and fibrinogen-replenished afibrinogenemic plasmas. Platelet adhesion was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) method, which was found to be closely correlated with adhesion of In-111-labeled platelets. Fibrinogen adsorption from afibrinogenemic plasma to polystyrene (Immulon I(R)) was low and <10 ng/cm(2). Platelet adhesion was absent on surfaces preadsorbed with afibrinogenemic plasma when the residual fibrinogen was low enough (<60 mu g/mL). Platelet adhesion was restored on polystyrene preadsorbed with fibrinogen-replenished afibrinogenemic plasma. Addition of even small, subnormal concentrations of fibrinogen to afibrinogenemic plasma greatly increased platelet adhesion. In addition, surface-bound fibrinogen's ability to mediate platelet adhesion was different, depending on the plasma concentration from which fibrinogen was adsorbed. These differences correlated with changes in the binding of a monoclonal antibody that binds to the A alpha chain RGDS (572-575), suggesting alteration in the conformation or orientation of the adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion to polystyrene preadsorbed with blood plasma thus appears to be a strongly bivariate function of adsorbed fibrinogen, responsive to both low amounts and altered states of the adsorbed molecule.

To explore the in vitro effects of surface immobilized PEO on the human inflammatory cells, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), we developed a diisocyanate-based method for coupling PEG to amine-modified glass, a surface previously shown to enhance macrophage adhesion and FBGC formation. Contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of PEG molecules bound to the surface and revealed that PEG molecular weight significantly influenced the efficiency of PEO coupling. We used a 10-day human monocyte culture protocol to demonstrate that the presence of surface coupled PEG molecules does not significantly decrease initial monocyte density or monocyte-derived macrophage density after 3 days. However, PEG-coupled surfaces significantly reduced long-term monocyte-derived macrophage density and virtually eliminated interleukin-4-induced FBGC formation observed at day 10. The cellular response to these PEG-coupled surfaces was related to the molecular weight of the PEG chains, which was varied between 200 Da and 18.5 kDa. These results suggest that an optimized PEG surface treatment may be effective in reducing inflammatory cell adhesion and possible degradation during the inflammatory response to an implanted biomedical device.

The achiral trimeric unit Gly-Nleu-Nleu was included as a guest sequence in a host structure such as Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-NleuNleu)(3)-(GIy-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 which retains triple helicity. A series of guest-host collagen mimetics composed of Gly-Nleu-Pro sequences as the host were synthesized and assessed for triple helicity. Guest sequences include Gly-Nleu-Nleu and Gly-Nx-Pro units, where Nx is the guest peptoid residue with alkyl and aralkyl side chains. We have continued to investigate functionalized template motifs and sequence variations. We are examining the effects of functionalization and sequence variation on triple helical stabilities and molecular properties in order to design novel collagen-based biomaterials.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Goodman, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,66,3,3,0,2,INDIAN ACADEMY SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"P B 8005 C V RAMAN AVENUE, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0253-4134,,,P INDIAN AS-CHEM SCI,Proc.

Ion-beam-based processes, such as ion implantation and ion-beam assisted deposition (IBAD) can provide beneficial surface layers with desirable properties without detrimentally affecting the bulk properties. Ion implantation has been successful in biomaterials modification, such as in improving the wear resistance of artificial joint components, in improving wettability, anticoagulability, anticalcific behavior of biomedical polymers, and in minimizing biofouling of medical devices, etc. IBAD has been used to prepare hydroxyapatite coatings with high adhesive strength on substrates of several implant materials. Biocompatible diamond-like carbon coatings and C-N films, antibacterial coatings and sealant coatings have also been produced by this technique. This paper reviews the present status of applications of the ion-beam process in modifying the surface of biomaterials, as well as the effects induced by ion-beam irradiation to crop seeds, cells and microbes.

Although device replacement can be considered an easy outpatient procedure. frequent replacements are inconvenient for the patient and may lead to malfunction of the tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Further understanding of the process of development and inhibition of the colonization of these polymer surfaces requires several comprehensive clinical studies. How ever, iii vivo research of the biomaterials of the voice prostheses is difficult and time consuming. In order to simulate the natural process of biofilm development under dynamic nutrient conditions, an artificial throat was developed. Biofilm developed on Groningen(R) button voice prostheses iii vitro a could not be distinguished from that formed over several months in,vitro.

For example, the freezing of an aqueous solution within a hydrophobic liquid gives a basic model for the freezing of biomaterials. Furthermore, the melting of an ice layer has close relations to cold thermal storage using ice. In the present study, both perfluolocarbon (PFC) and silicon oil were adopted as the testing liquids. The ambient liquid temperatures ranged from 5 to 40 degrees C. The inclination angle of the ice plate was varied from 0 to 180 degrees at 30 degrees steps. The experimental results revealed that the inclination angle of the ice layer has a vital effect on the melting heat-transfer characteristics of the ice.","Hokkaido Univ, Div Mech Sci, Grad Sch Engn, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan","Yamada, M (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Div Mech Sci, Grad Sch Engn, N13-W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan.",,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0075-8450,,3-540-66333-9,LECT NOTES PHYS,,,1999.0,533,,,,,,159,168,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Mechanical; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Physics,BQ13R,WOS:000087263600014,,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies from our laboratory have reported the tumorigenic potentials of these PUs in vivo and in vitro. PU-components had inhibited the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in cultures of mouse Balb/c (A31-1-1) and chinese hamster V79 fibroblasts. Since GJIC is crucial for normal differentiation of a cell population, this perturbed gap junction is most likely to play the major role in the PU-induced tumorigenesis. Gap junctions are composed of a multigene family of proteins called connexins. Various tumor promoters have been shown to inhibit GJIC by phosphorylation modification of connexin proteins. Mutations in connexin genes have also been found to lead abnormally regulated cell-cell communication. We are interested to elucidate the mecahnism of tumorigenesis induced by biomaterials including PUs. Ln the present study, we choose three PU-induced tumor clones, namely clone-2, 5 and 6, isolated from A31-1-1 cells, for investigation of mutation in their cx43 gene, the major gap junction protein of this cell line. The connexin43 (cx43) gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The entire coding region located in the exon 2 of ex 43 gene was sequenced directly from the PCR amplified product. None of the clones showed a difference in their cx43 sequences with the published sequence for mouse cx43 sequence. Thus, probably a post-translational modification or a defect in gene expression, but, not a mutation in the coding sequence of cx43, is involved in the polyurethane-induced inhibition of GJIC during the tumorigenesis in vitro.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-5805-8,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,181,185,,,,,,5,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,BP18F,WOS:000084339700033,,,,,2019-02-25

Current treatments, although fairly successful, do not provide the optimum therapy. These treatments typically rely on donor tissues obtained either from the patient or from another source. The former raises the issue of supply, whereas the latter poses the risk of rejection and disease transfer. This has prompted orthopedic surgeons and scientists to look for viable alternatives. In recent years, tissue engineering has gained increasing support as a method to treat orthopedic disorders. Because it uses principles of engineering, biology, and chemistry, tissue engineering may provide a more effective approach to the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders than traditional methods.

Bubble collapse in liquids results in an enormous concentration of energy from the conversion of the kinetic energy of the liquid motion into heating of the contents of the bubble. The high local temperatures and pressures, combined with extraordinarily rapid cooling, provide a unique means for driving chemical reactions under extreme conditions. A diverse set of applications of ultrasound to enhance chemical reactivity has been explored with important uses in synthetic materials chemistry. For example, the sonochemical decomposition of volatile organometallic precursors in low-volatility solvents produces nanostructured materials in various forms with high catalytic activities. Nanostructured metals, alloys, oxides, carbides and sulfides, nanometer colloids, and nanostructured supported catalysts can all be prepared by this general route. Another important application of sonochemistry in materials chemistry has been the preparation of biomaterials, most notably protein microspheres. Such microspheres have a wide range of biomedical applications, including their use in echo contrast agents for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, contrast enhancement, and oxygen or drug delivery. Other applications include the modification of polymers and polymer surfaces.","Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Bath, Dept Chem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ksuslick@uiuc.edu; chsgjp@bath.ac.uk,"Price, Gareth/B-5293-2011; Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011","Price, Gareth/0000-0003-4983-5722; Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701",,,,143,1103,1133,31,461,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0084-6600,,,ANNU REV MATER SCI,Annu.

To this end, type I collagen coatings containing a model biomolecule, lysozyme, were deposited on Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. Two deposition methods were examined. In the first, lysozyme was deposited concurrently with collagen, while in the second, protein was impregnated into previously deposited collagen coatings. The amount of collagen and the amount of lysozyme loaded into collagen were varied to provide different amounts of weakly and strongly bound protein. Release and retention of lysozyme were monitored over a 7 d period of incubation in physiological saline. For both methods, larger amounts of collagen in the coatings allowed incorporation of more lysozyme. Additionally, loading collagen coatings with greater amounts of lysozyme resulted in release of more protein. During the first 24-96 h of incubation, loosely bound protein was eluted, resulting in release of 2 mu g to 55 mg (5-75% of the amount available) of enzymatically active lysozyme. This left 25-95% of the protein bound to the collagen-coated biomaterials and, thus, available for later release during degradation of the collagen.","Univ Kentucky, Ctr Biomed Engn, Wenner Gren Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Puleo, DA (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Ctr Biomed Engn, Wenner Gren Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",,,,,,,9,9,10,0,2,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",1073-1199,,,ARTIF CELL BLOOD SUB,Artif.

This method is based on the use of a human bone marrow cell culture and was developed as an alternative to animal experiments. Human bone marrow cell culture has certain advantages over other cell culture models, as its results show a greater conformity with animal experimental results and clinical studies. Primary cell adherence, cell number, cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix, cell viability and cell differentiation were used as indicative parameters of biocompatibility. After 2 weeks in culture, differences could be observed between the biomaterials with respect to these parameters. Cell numbers were greatest on the hydroxyapatite ceramic specimens, but were decreased on the titanium alloy specimens. Extracellular matrix hydroxyapatite production was high for ceramics, but reduced for titanium specimens. The polymers allowed only a few cells to adhere, and there were no signs of extracellular matrix production. The influence of biomaterials on differentiation of large numbers of cells was analysed by using flow cytophotometry. There were similar populations of T cells and monocytes on all specimens. However, extended B cell and granulocyte populations were observed with titanium and polyethylene.","Univ Marburg, Dept Orthopaed, D-35033 Marburg, Germany; Univ Ulm, Dept Biomat, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","Wilke, A (reprint author), Univ Marburg, Dept Orthopaed, Baldingerstr, D-35033 Marburg, Germany.",,,,,,,26,6,6,0,0,FRAME,NOTTINGHAM,"RUSSELL & BURCH HOUSE 96-98 NORTH SHERWOOD ST, NOTTINGHAM, NOTTS, ENGLAND NG1 4EE",0261-1929,,,ATLA-ALTERN LAB ANIM,ATLA-Altern.

Our studies have established that heterogeneous mimetic peptide surfaces (MPS) containing both the -RGD- (cell-binding) and FHRRIKA- (putative heparin-binding) peptides, unique to BSP, in the ratio of 75:25 (MPS II) or 50:50 (RIPS LII) proved to be more biologically relevant and specific for RCO cell function. The initial response of human osteoblast-like cells to these surfaces was mediated by the collagen (alpha(2)beta(1)) and vitronectin receptors (alpha(v)beta(3)), whereas the vitronectin receptor alone dominated longer-term events (> 30 min). MPS II and III surfaces enhanced cell spreading and longterm events such as mineralization of the extracellular matrix compared to homogenous peptide surfaces and controls. Furthermore, extensive mineralization of the ECM deposited by RCOs occurred when the peptide was coupled to an interfacial interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) that resisted protein deposition (i.e., non-specific adsorption) and fouling, Work on thermo-reversible P(NIPAAm-co-AAc) hydrogels demonstrated the ability to create materials that can be delivered to the body in a minimally invasive manner and support tissue regeneration. These hydrogels can be modified to incorporate biofunctional components such as the biomimetic peptides, theoretically enhancing their ability to foster tissue regeneration. These results suggest that biomaterials can be engineered to mimic ECM components of bone (e.g., various organs) by grafting peptides in the appropriate ratios of the cell and heparin-binding domains, and ultimately modulate the expression of the osteoblast cell phenotype, Approaches similar to the one presented in this work can be used to design materials for hybrid artificial organs and other tissues.","Northwestern Univ, Div Biol Mat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; Robert R McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60201 USA","Healy, KE (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Div Biol Mat, 311 E Chicago Ave,Ward Bldg 10-116, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR43187]; NIDCR NIH HHS [T32 DE07042],,,31,130,141,1,29,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-194-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,1999.0,875,,,,,,24,35,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08491.x,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Transplantation",Engineering; Materials Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Transplantation,BN31W,WOS:000081586000003,10415555.0,,,,2019-02-25

Although not as widely used as metallic implants and various biopolymers, bioceramics have been the focus of close scrutiny for over three decades and are now finding some significant applications, especially in orthopaedics and dentistry. Bioceramics can be categorized by their degree of chemical reactivity. Oxide ceramics are often used for their relatively inert behavior. At the other extreme, resorbable bioceramics are highly reactive in relation to the physiological environment. Finally, surface reactive materials have intermediate reactivity and are designed to provide direct bonding to tissues.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Shackelford, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,21,15,16,0,1,TRANSTEC PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",0255-5476,,,MATER SCI FORUM,,,1999.0,293,,,,,,1,4,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.293.1,,,,4,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Materials Science,BM15E,WOS:000077814000001,,,,,2019-02-25

Recent developments have concentrated on the chemistry of precursors, in forming and sintering processes, and on surface finish of components. Today's main applications of zirconia ceramics is in THR ball heads.

Alginates possess many favorable properties required in biomaterials, but are unable to specifically interact with mammalian cells. We have therefore covalently modified alginate polysaccharides with RGD-containing cell adhesion ligands utilizing aqueous carbodiimide chemistry. The chemistry has been optimized and quantified with reaction efficiencies reaching 80% or greater. The concentration of peptide available for reaction was then varied to create hydrogels with a range of ligand densities. Mouse skeletal myoblasts were cultured on alginate hydrogel surfaces coupled with GRGDY peptides to illustrate achievement of cellular interaction with the otherwise non-adhesive hydrogel substrate. Myoblasts adhere to GRGDY-modified alginate surfaces, proliferate, fuse into multinucleated myofibrils, and express heavy-chain myosin which is a differentiation marker for skeletal muscle. Myoblast adhesion and spreading on these GRGDY-modified hydrogels was inhibited with soluble ligand added to the seeding medium, illustrating the specificity of adhesion to these materials. Alginate may prove to be an ideal material with which to confer specific cellular interactive properties, potentially allowing for the control of long-term gene expression of cells within these matrices.

Polyethylene-glycol-diisocyanate (PEG-diisocyanate, 3400 MW) may potentially react with protein amines to form molecular barriers on adsorbed proteins on biomaterials, thereby masking adhesive ligands and preventing acute surface thrombosis. To test this notion, PE, PTFE, and glass microconduits were pre-adsorbed with fibrinogen and treated with PEG-diisocyanate, non-reactive PEG-dihydroxyl, or remained untreated. Following perfusion of In-111-labeled platelets in whole human blood for 1 min (wall shear rate = 312 s(-1)), PEG-diisocyanate treated surfaces experienced 96% (PE), 97% (PTFE) and 94% (glass) less platelet deposition than untreated surfaces. Similar reductions were seen for PEG-diisocyanate versus PEG-dihydroxyl treatment. Low shear perfusions of plasma for one hour prior to blood contact did not reduce the inhibitory effect of PEG-diisocyanate. Platelet adhesion onto collagen coated glass coverslips and platelet deposition onto preclotted Dacron was also reduced by treatment with PEG-diisocyanate (93 and 91 %, respectively). Protein-reactive PEG may thus have utility in forming molecular barriers on surface associated proteins to inhibit acute thrombosis on cardiovascular biomaterials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Crosslinking of cruciate samples was carried out with: (i) no applied load, (ii) an initial 25 g (similar to 30 kPa) equibiaxial load, or (iii) an initial 200 g (similar to 250 kPa) equibiaxial load. All loading during crosslinking was done under a defined initial equibiaxial load and subsequently fixed biaxial strain. Load changes during crosslinking were monitored. Mechanical testing and constraint during crosslinking were carried out in a custom-built biaxial servo-hydraulic testing system incorporating four actuators with phase-controlled waveform synthesis, high frame-rate video dimension analysis, and computer-interfaced data acquisition The paired biaxial stress-strain responses under equibiaxial loading at 1 Hz (before and after treatment) were evaluated for changes in anisotropic extensibility by calculation of an anisotropy index. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on freeze-fractured samples to relate collagen crimp morphology to constraint during crosslinking. Fresh tissue was markedly anisotropic with the base-to-apex direction of the pericardium being less extensible and stiffer than the circumferential direction. After unconstrained crosslinking, the extensibility in the circumferential direction, the stiffness in the base-to-apex direction, and the tissue's anisotropy were all reduced. Anisotropy was preserved in the tissue treated with an applied 25 g load; however, tissue treated with an applied 200 g load became extremely stiff and nearly isotropic. SEM micrographs correlated well with observed extensibility in that the collagen fibre morphology changed from very crimped (unconstrained crosslinking), to straight (200 g applied load). Biaxial stress-fixation may allow engineering of bioprosthetic materials for specific medical applications. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The improvement in the interface compatibility of polymers selected for implantation by directed surface modification is an important contribution to biomaterial development. Different polymer properties are adjusted and characterized independently of the carrier polymer by means of introduction of modern surface analytical methods and surface techniques. In addition, the interactions between the modified polymer surface and the biological system are measured. In this way, the hydrophilization of a polyurethane (Tecolex(TM)) and a poly(ether sulfone) by plasma induced graftcopolymerization of hydrogels like poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) leads to improved blood compatibility. Functionalization by means of SO2 plasma treatment of medical grade poly(vinyl chloride) increases the adsorption of the basal membrane protein fibronectin, which correlates with an improvement in cell growth. A suitable interface for an improved cell growth of hum an vascular endothelial cells as well as for cornea endothelial cells has been created by immobilization of the cell adhesion mediator fibronectin using bifunctional spacer molecules at several carrier polymer surfaces like smooth poly(vinyl chloride), modified polyurethane, Tecoflex(TM) and poly(dimethyl siloxane).","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Text Chem & Macromol Chem, D-52062 Aachen, Germany","Klee, D (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Text Chem & Macromol Chem, Veltmanpl 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",klee@dwi.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,153,111,113,2,59,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-3195,,3-540-65933-1,ADV POLYM SCI,Adv.

In this paper, we will expand on the use of wheat gluten films as active layers, i.e. when the film contribute by itself to the food preservation. Some potential uses of these biomaterials (e.g. modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables, slow release of food preservatives) are described with examples. The development of biopackaging or edible films with selective gas permeability is very promising for controlling respiratory exchange and improving the conservation of fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. Wheat gluten films appear to have suitable O-2 barrier properties while remaining relatively permeable to CO2. The gas permeability's of gluten based films were measured at various temperatures and relative humidites. O-2/CO2 selectivity increased from 3 (at 4 degrees C and low RH) to more than 45 (at 40 degrees c and 95%RH). Some selective gluten-based films have been shown to lead to the creation of very original atmospheres when used to wrap fresh mushrooms. The modified atmosphere rise to an equilibrium composition of 2-3% CO2 and 2-3% O-2 which is favourable to the mushroom overall quality. The diffusion of sorbic acid in various wheat gluten film was studied and the release from the film to a model food was measured and modelled, The anti-microbial effect of various edible gluten I sorbic acid based films was evaluated against Penicillium notatum. Simple gluten-based films had no own fungicidal effect but the gluten I lipid based films showed a strong sorbic acid retention and a marked own fungicidal effect, either at 30 degrees C or 4 degrees C, delaying the Penicillium notatum growth for more then 21 days.","INRA, ENSAM, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France","Guilbert, S (reprint author), INRA, ENSAM, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INST NATL RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE,PARIS,"147 RUE DE L'UNIVERSITE, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0293-1915,,2-7380-0874-7,COLLOQ INRA,,,1999.0,,91,,,,,315,320,,,,,,6,"Agronomy; Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology",Agriculture; Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,BN59S,WOS:000082330400041,,,,,2019-02-25

The fact that these diseases have an increased incidence in uremia, and particularly in dialysis patients, suggests an increased exposure to oxidative stress in this condition. In haemodialysis (HD), the absence of a complete correction of the uremic toxicity together with the untoward effects of the dialysis, malnutrition and the progressive worsening of the clinical condition, can lead to a high susceptibility to oxidative stress by an abnormal production of oxidants - including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and uremic toxins with prooxidant function - and defective antioxidant protection. One of the most investigated biological effects of the oxidative stress in the HD patients is lipid peroxidation in plasma and blood cell membranes. Moreover, we have recently described how abnormal apoptosis in peripheral blood leukocytes is associated with cell oxidative stress (intracellular thiol depletion). Vitamin E, in both in vitro and in vivo conditions, has been proposed to partially correct these effects. in this review we evaluated some features of two new dialysis strategies using an antioxidant approach to the protection against the oxidant stress in HD. Their rationale is based on the emerging role of vitamin E in counteracting some biological effects associated with oxidant stress namely lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. These techniques use: 1) the recirculation of the dialysate through a suspension of vitamin E-enriched liposomes combined with the supplementation by the dialysate with ascorbic acid, this method has been called hemolipodialysis; 2) the coating of the dialysis membrane with vitamin E (vitamin E-modified dialysis membranes). These unconventional approaches to the antioxidant therapy in HD open a widely unexplored and promising field in the evolution of the biomaterials and dialysis quality.","Univ Urbino, G Fornaini Inst Biol Chem, I-61029 Urbino, PS, Italy","Galli, F (reprint author), Univ Urbino, G Fornaini Inst Biol Chem, Via Saffi 2, I-61029 Urbino, PS, Italy.",,"Galli, Francesco/K-5048-2016","Galli, Francesco/0000-0003-3626-051X",,,,71,54,55,0,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0253-5068,,,BLOOD PURIFICAT,Blood Purif.,,1999.0,17,2-3,,,,,79,94,,10.1159/000014379,,,,16,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,229RQ,WOS:000082208700004,10449865.0,,,,2019-02-25

From the original description of continuous arterio-venous haemofiltration, new techniques such as continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration and high flux dialysis have been developed and clinically utilised. A parallel improvement in efficiency has been achieved with urea daily clearances as high as 50 litres or more. The use of special highly permeable dialysers has also permitted to increase the clearances of larger solutes thus leading to significant removals of chemical substances involved in the acute inflammation and sepsis. In this field, recent observations have suggested to use haemofiltration with high volumes of fluid exchange. The hardware and software of the newer continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) are certainly the key point in achieving these results and in safely performing such challenging techniques.","St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy","Ronco, C (reprint author), St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,31,11,11,1,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0253-5068,,,BLOOD PURIFICAT,Blood Purif.,,1999.0,17,2-3,,,,,166,172,,10.1159/000014389,,,,7,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,229RQ,WOS:000082208700014,10449875.0,,,,2019-02-25

Images of internal strain or displacement may provide valuable information about pathological processes such as edema and fibrosis which are known to alter the mechanical properties of tissue. In this study we developed experimental methods for measuring internal deformation in highly scattering tissue with OCT and applied them to tissue phantoms and living tissue. Piezoelectric actuators were configured to compress the samples in steps of 5-10 mu m as images were captured synchronously using either a frame or a line-by-line acquisition mode. The displacements of structures inside the samples were quantified using speckle-tracking algorithms based on cross correlation or optical flow of selected features. Displacements as small as a few micrometers were measurable in heterogeneous gelatin phantoms containing scattering particles and living skin. The results suggest that the composition of tissues layers whose elasticities differ greatly (e.g., fat and muscle) can be deduced visually from image sequences without the need for complicated image processing. However, better models are needed to transform the displacement images into quantitative maps of subtle regional variations of the elastic modulus.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Schmitt, JM (reprint author), Nellcor Puritan Bennett Corp, 4280 Hacienda Dr, Pleasanton, CA 94588 USA.",,,,,,,8,5,5,1,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3068-4,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3598,,,,,,47,55,,10.1117/12.347506,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics",Engineering; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics,BN09M,WOS:000080656800006,,,,,2019-02-25

Although fatigue fracture and wear are frequently reported in orthopedic applications such as in the hip joint prostheses, they can be fatal in mechanical heart valves. While it is not possible to avoid failure, recent work has focused on predictive tools to enable more accurate prediction so as to avoid catastrophic failure in-vivo.

Sugar hydrolysis was negligible in trehalose systems and very low in raffinose. Hydrolysis was noticeable in sucrose systems, however, leading to browning development. Sucrose systems showed, by far, the fastest colour development, particularly in the presence of lysine and glycine as sources of amino groups. The results confirm the extraordinary stability of trehalose.

Results were related with conventional blood compatibility measurements: albumin adsorption, fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. While contact angle measurements with water are material-related but constant in time, contact angle measurements with plasma changed over time owing to protein adsorption on the solid-liquid interface. The contact medium plasma did not influence the initial contact angle. Contact angles on PDMS decreased most in time (41 degrees) and demonstrated highest levels of conventionally measured albumin and fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. PTFE, with the lowest contact angle decrease over a 500 minutes period (19 degrees), showed low fibrinogen and albumin adsorption as well as low platelet adhesion. PU and HDPE demonstrated almost similar initial contact angles with plasma and contact angle decreases (26 and 27 degrees), intermediate protein adsorption, and platelet adhesion. We conclude that biocompatibility properties of the tested materials may be more related to the behaviour of their contact angles in time, than to the initial hydrophobic or hydrophilic state.","Univ Groningen, Inst Biomed Mat Sci & Applicatio, Div Artificial Organs, Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Dept Cardiol & Thorac Surg, Groningen, Netherlands","Rakhorst, G (reprint author), Fac Med, BMSA, Div Artificial Organs, Bloemsingel 10, NL-9712 KZ Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,11,5,5,2,21,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The quality and quantity of the coating is sensitive to application techniques, metal substrate, and manufacturing controls-all important in creating a clinically successful coating. Bioactive coatings other than hydroxyapatite have had mixed success and are generally not available for clinical use at this time. Clinical experience with hydroxyapatite-coated hip implants have focused on the femoral component, where results approach the standard of cemented components. Acetabular components have been less impressive when hydroxyapatite is the primary source of fixation without macrostructured substrate or augmentation with screws. Analysis of sequential follow-up radiographs in patients with hydroxyapatite-coated hips consistently reveals the changes associated with prompt and tenacious biologic fixation of the femoral component. These changes are apparent at 6 months and persist beyond 8 years. While the optimal design of the components, the surface structure of the metal substrate, and the ideal application method are still evolving. the use of hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses for hip arthroplasty has been proven safe and successful for clinical use where biologically fixed components are indicated.","NYU, Med Ctr, Hosp Joint Dis Orthopaed Inst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, New York, NY 10003 USA","Jaffe, WL (reprint author), NYU, Med Ctr, Hosp Joint Dis Orthopaed Inst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 301 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,203,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,4-431-70241-5,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,159,187,,,,,,29,"Materials Science, Biomaterials; Orthopedics; Surgery",Materials Science; Orthopedics; Surgery,BP76Y,WOS:000086113200016,,,,,2019-02-25

These consisted of unfunctionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blended with small percentages of either ethylene oxide (EO)- or phosphorylcholine (PC) ester-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes to increase surface hydrophilicity. The latter was formed by the hydrosilation of a dimethylsilane-terminated polydimethylsiloxane with omega-vinylphosphorylcholine ester. The ester was synthesized from 9-hydroxy-1-decene and 2-chlorotrimethylamine incorporating the phosphoryl functionality. The blends were cast from a dilute solution of chloroform onto low-density polyethylene (LDPE). A comparison of methods to implement the underwater captive bubble (UWCB) technique, the curved UWCB technique or the modified UWCB technique, a convenient method for determining theta(AW) on curved surfaces, demonstrated that both methods were accurate and precise. As the percentage of functionalized polydimethylsiloxane in a family of blends increased, theta(AW) decreased. The theta(AW) value on the EO-siloxane blends was nonetheless typically 30 degrees less than that on the PC-siloxane blends. The values of theta(AW) on blends determined with the modified UWCB technique demonstrated that too little functionalized polydimethylsiloxane was present to produce a hydrophilic surface promising hemocompatibility.","Howard Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA; Howard Univ, Dept Chem, Washington, DC 20059 USA","Collins, WE (reprint author), Howard Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",,,,,,,27,1,1,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0169-4243,,,J ADHES SCI TECHNOL,J.

We now report the polymerization of a phospholipid monolayer assembly onto an alkylated hydrogel substrate with significant alteration in both surface chemistry and mass transport properties at the hydrogel-water interface.

Polymer networks were synthesised from the PFPE macromonomers of increasing chain length and the adhesion and proliferation of corneal, vascular and bone cells was evaluated on these polymers. The polymer surfaces were quite hydrophobic, having sessile air-water contact angles ranging between 96 and 125 degrees. However, these polymers supported the attachment and growth of bovine corneal epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts at 60-100% of the rate of cell growth on the culture substratum, TCPS. Furthermore, the PFPE polymers supported the attachment and growth of vascular endothelial cells (from human umbilical artery) and human bone-derived cells over a 7 day period at an equal level to TCPS. The relationship between the macromonomer chain length (n = 1 to 4) and the ability of the resulting PFPE homopolymer to support the overgrowth of corneal epithelial tissue was also evaluated. The PFPE-containing polymers supported corneal epithelial tissue overgrowth, with the most effective having a performance equivalent to that of TCPS. Tn addition to these homopolymers, copolymers comprising of PFPE and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) were also synthesised. Surprisingly, the addition of DMAEMA to the PFPE polymer network lead to a reduction in the growth and attachment of corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts. These results indicate that PFPE-based materials show a potential for use in the development of biomaterials in the ocular, vascular and orthopaedic areas.","Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; CSIRO, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; CSIRO, Clayton S MDC, Vic 3169, Australia","Steele, JG (reprint author), Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, POB 184, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia.",jack.steele@riverside.molsci.csiro.au,,"Laycock, Bronwyn/0000-0002-0251-844X",,,,31,15,15,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To determine which implant elicited the least tissue and cellular response overall, a weighted score including collagen thickness, lymphocyte infiltration, and angiogenesis was calculated for each implant. According to these preliminary investigations. PIB/PDMS bicomponent networks are suitable for implant applications.","Univ Akron, Dept Polymer Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA; Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Sherman, MA (reprint author), Univ Akron, Dept Polymer Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",,,,,,,18,21,22,0,7,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

However the tissue response associated with this and other polymer implants continues to limit any long-term function. One of the major approaches currently being investigated to improve biocompatibility involves surface modification of the base polymer. In this report, we attempted to alter the healing characteristics of ePTFE by denucleation, a process which removes air trapped within the interstices of the material. Additionally, adsorption of extracellular proteins on the denucleated polymer was also tested. After 5 weeks implanted in subcutaneous and epididymal fat sites of rats, the material was explanted and the healing around the implant evaluated histologically. We found that in skin implants, denucleation alone resulted in a substantial reduction in the fibrous capsule which has been previously reported for untreated ePTFE, and an increase in blood vessel development around and within the polymer. Absorption of extracellular matrix proteins prior to implantation resulted in a reduced vascularity of the implants compared with denucleation-only implants. Implants in fat tissue, regardless of treatment, showed very little tissue reaction, either in the number of inflammatory cells, development of a fibrous capsule or neovascularization. These results suggest that the presence of air nuclei within porous material may contribute to the inappropriate healing response associated with these polymers. In addition, they confirm earlier reports that healing around implanted polymers is tissue-specific.","Arizona Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Surg Res, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA","Boswell, CA (reprint author), Arizona Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Surg Res, POB 245084, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",,,,,,,18,11,11,0,1,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

According to two-dimensional NMR, the backbone structure of this polymer was as expected and contained no byproducts formed by acid catalyzed addition across the fumarate double bond. Kinetic studies of the transesterification showed that the molecular weight reached a final M-n of 4900 (+/-700) and M-w of 9100 (+/-1300) after 16 h, while the polydispersity index remained below 1.8 throughout the reaction.

PHO-cast films were sterilized by either ethylene oxide (EO) gas at 38 degrees C or gamma radiation (2.5 Mrad) in air at room temperature. The physical characteristics of the EO and gamma-sterilized PHO were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile strength analyses. In addition, various analytical methods were used to detect modifications in the chemical and morphological structure of PHO, namely, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The results show that EO sterilization did not modify the chemical and physical characteristics of PHO, however, significant modifications in both the structural and tensile properties were observed with gamma-sterilized PHO. These changes accounted for decreases in both the weight average, number average and melting temperature, and increases in the heat of fusion and tensile strength. No residual EO was detected following sterilization as revealed by head-space chromatography. The physical and structural properties of PHO were shown to be well preserved following EO sterilization, whereas gamma radiation caused random chain scission and physical cross-linking, a frequent phenomenon observed with organic polymers.","Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Montpellier I, Fac Pharm, CRBA, CNRS,URA 1465, Montpellier, France; CHUQ, Ctr Rech, Biomat Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,28,9,9,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Solution-cast PHO films were incubated in a citrate buffer solution with and without acid phosphatase and in an acetate buffer with and without beta-glucuronidase for periods ranging from 7 to GO days. The physical characterization of the PHO films was analyzed by SEM and tensile strength studies. In addition. various analytical methods were used to detect modifications in the chemical and morphological structure of the PHO, namely, ESCA, FTIR, DSC, X-ray diffraction, and SEC. The results indicate that the enzymatic conditions selected in the present study induced no significant surface morphological or chemical modifications, and no significant weight loss was observed after 60 days of incubation. However, as revealed by weight average molecular weight (M) over bar(w) and number average molecular weight (M) over bar(n) decreases, changes in the bulk structure of the PHO were observed with acid phosphatase at 28 and 60 days, in contrast to smaller (M) over bar(w) and (M) over bar(n) decreases recorded in both the buffers and the beta-glucuronidase. The tensile properties had decreased following incubation, yet showed no difference under all of the selected conditions. With no weight loss or surface changes, the PHO films incubated in acid phosphatase showed only a chemical hydrolytic process characterized by (M) over bar(w) and (M) over bar(n) decreases with time of incubation. The present study demonstrated that the degradation of PHO films is one of slow, chemical hydrolysis only, perhaps requiring several months of incubation. The hydrophobic nature of the long alkyl pendent chain in PHO may be responsible for this slow process. The inability of enzymes to degrade PHO may be attributed to the latter's poor adsorption capacity, due to its hydrophobic nature, and to a lack of specificity in the catalytic activity of these enzymes.","Univ Laval, Quebec Biomat Inst, Ctr Rech, CHUQ,Dept Surg,Lab Expt Surg, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Univ Montpellier I, Fac Pharm, CRBA, CNRS,URA 1465, Montpellier, France; Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,,,,28,16,16,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Albumin, fibrinogen, and dimyrstoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were used as model components. The amount of DMPC adsorbed on the MAPC polymers increased with an increase in the MAPC unit composition of the polymer. The methylene chain length of the MAPC unit was another factor influencing the DMPC adsorption when the MAPC unit composition of the MAPC polymer was low. The state of albumin and DMPC liposome adsorbed on the 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer was determined by dynamic contact angle (DCA) measurement. The adsorption strength of albumin on the MPC polymer was weaker than that on the poly[n-butyl methacrylate (BMA)], that is: the albumin was detached from the MPC polymer during the rinsing process. On the poly(BMA) surface, no difference in the shape of the DCA loops before and after contact with the DMPC liposomal suspension was observed. Fibrinogen adsorption on the MAPC polymer was detected by gold-colloid labeled immunoassay. The amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on every MAPC polymer surface was reduced by addition of the DMPC liposome in the fibrinogen solution. The number of platelets adhered on the MAPC polymer was also decreased when the DMPC liposome was present in the fibrinogen solution during pretreatment. We concluded that phospholipids were preferentially adsorbed on the MAPC polymer surface compared with plasma protein and that the adsorbed phospholipids played an important role in showing an excellent blood compatibility on the MAPC polymer.","Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Med & Dent Engn, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; Nihon Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Chem, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018308, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Iwasaki, Y (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Med & Dent Engn, Chiyoda Ku, 2-3-10 Kanda-surugadai, Tokyo 1010062, Japan.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,35,16,16,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Localized perturbations in the chemical potential of water as by, for example, contacting with a solid surface, induces compensating changes in water structure that can be sensed tens of nanometers from the point of origin using the surface force apparatus (SFA) and ancillary techniques. These instruments reveal attractive or repulsive forces between opposing surfaces immersed in water, over-and-above that anticipated by continuum theory (DLVO), that are attributed to a variable density (partial molar volume) of a more-or-less ordered water structure, depending on the water wettability (surface energy) of the water-contacting surfaces. Water structure at surfaces is thus found to be a manifestation of hydrophobicity and, while mechanistic/theoretical interpretation of experimental results remains the subject of some debate in the literature, convergence of experimental observations permit a quantitative definition of the heretofore relative terms 'hydrophobic' and 'hydrophilic'. In particular, long-range attractive forces (< 100 nm) are detected only between surfaces exhibiting a water contact angle theta > 65 deg (defined as hydrophobic surfaces with pure water adhesion tension tau(0) = gamma(0)cos theta < 30 dyn cm(-1) where gamma(0) is water interfacial tension = 72.8 dyn cm(-1)). Short range repulsive forces (< 5 nm) are detected between surfaces exhibiting theta < 65 deg (hydrophilic surfaces, tau(0) > 30 dyn cm(-1)). These findings together with other lines of chemical evidence suggest at least two distinct kinds of water structure and reactivity: a relatively less-dense water region against hydrophobic surfaces with an open hydrogen-bonded network and a relatively more-dense water region against hydrophilic surfaces with a collapsed hydrogen-bonded network. Solvent properties of interfacial water profoundly influence the biological response to materials in a surprisingly straightforward manner when key measures of biological activity sensitive to interfacial phenomenon are scaled against water adhesion tension tau(0) of contacting surfaces. Protein adsorption, activation of blood coagulation, and bioadhesion are offered as examples in point, illustrating that the hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrast in the biological response to materials, often disputed in biomaterials science, is very clear when viewed from the perspective of water structure and reactivity at surfaces.","Becton Dickinson Res Ctr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Vogler, EA (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Steidle Hall, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,95,165,167,1,41,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The polymers are poly[2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-co-n-butyl methacrylate] copolymer (PMB)s with different MPC unit compositions, and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). Surface analysis by dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that the mobility of the polymer chain on the PET substrate depended on the MPC unit composition, but there was no significant difference between the PMBs with 3-10 mol% MPC units and poly(HEMA). Fibronectin adsorption on the polymer surface from a cell culture medium was determined by immunoassay. The adsorbed fibronection was evenly distrubuted in every polymer, however, the amount was reduced with an increase in the MPC unit composition in the PMB. This result suggested that the MPC unit could weaken the interaction between the polymer surface and proteins. When fibroblast L-929 cells, were cultured on the polymers, the cells adhered and the number of cells increased on not only the hydrophobic poly(BMA) but also on the hydrophilic poly(HEMA). However, the number of cells that adhered on the PMB surface decreased with an increase in the MPC unit composition. This was a result of the fibronectin adsorption behavior. Thus, it could be concluded that since the PMB could suppress cell adhesion proteins e.g. fibronectin, the PMB showed excellent cell adhesive resistance properties.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Biomat & Bioengn, Div Organ Mat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010062, Japan","Ishihara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,39,125,127,0,35,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

We have used PEO-polybutadiene-PEO triblock copolymer to graft PEG to biomaterials by gamma-irradiation for a total radiation dose of 1 Mrad. The molecular weight of PEG in the block copolymer was 5000. In vitro study showed that fibrinogen adsorption to Silastic(R) polyethylene, and glass was reduced by 70 similar to 95% by PEO grafting. On the other hand, the reduction of fibrinogen adsorption was only 30% on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE). III vitro platelet adhesion study showed that almost no platelets could adhere to PEG-coated Silastic(R), polyethylene, and glass, while numerous platelet aggregates were found on the ePTFE. The platelet adhesion in vitro corresponded to the fibrinogen adsorption. When the PEG-grafted surfaces were tested ex vivo using a series shunt in a canine model, the effect of the grafted PEG was not noticeable. Platelet deposition on ePTFE was reduced by PEO grafting from 8170 +/- 1030 to 5100 +/- 460 platelets 10(-3) mu m(2), but numerous thrombi were still present on the PEG-grafted surface. The numbers of platelets cumulated on Silastic(R), polyethylene, and glass were 100 +/- 80, 169 +/- 35, and 24 +/- 22 platelets 10(-3) mu m(2) respectively. This is about 35% reduction in platelet deposition by PEO grafting. While the numbers of deposited platelets were small, the decreases were not as large as those expected from the in vitro study. This may be due to a number of reasons which have to be clarified in future studies, but it appears that in vitro platelet adhesion and fibrinogen adsorption studies may not be a valuable predictor for the in vitro or ex vivo behavior of the PEG-grafted surfaces.","Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Park, K (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 39081],,,51,40,40,0,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Whereas most S. aureus clinical isolates elaborate a wide repertoire of bacterial surface 'receptors' called adhesins, exhibiting specific binding of individual host proteins, S. epidermidis is lacking most of such protein adhesins. To document the interactions between, S. epidermidis and various surface-adsorbed proteins, we first compared promotion of bacterial attachment by seven purified human proteins immobilized onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) coverslips. Only two of them, namely fibronectin and fibrinogen, exhibited adhesion-promoting activities. In the presence of native heparin or two functionalized dextrans (CMDBS for Carboxy Methyl, Benzylamide sulfonate/sulfate), a dose-dependent inhibition of S. epidermidis adhesion to fibronectin-coated, but not to fibrinogen-coated surfaces was observed. The inhibitory effects of each CMDBS were much stronger than that of native heparin. In contrast, a control highly negatively charged dextran exclusively substituted with carboxy methyl groups exerted no inhibition on S. epidermidis adhesion. To evaluate how CMDBS could interfere with S. epidermidis attachment to coverslips coated in vivo with extracellular matrix components, we also tested PMMA surfaces retrieved from tissue cages subcutaneously implanted in guinea pigs. Each CMDBS, but not heparin, strongly inhibited S. epidermidis adhesion to explanted coverslips, even in the presence of tissue cage fluid. In conclusion, fibronectin plays an important role in promoting S. epidermidis attachment to implanted biomaterials. Furthermore, S. epidermidis adhesion to fibronectin-coated or implanted biomaterials can be efficiently blocked in vitro by CMDBS.","Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland; Univ Paris 13, Lab Rech Macromol, CNRS UMR 7540, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Francois, P (reprint author), Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland.",,"Didier, letourneur/H-5268-2012","Didier, letourneur/0000-0003-2197-9468",,,,62,12,12,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Methods: a series of aluminium step-wedges were obtained from academic and industrial research laboratories. These were analysed by energy dispersive X-ray procedures. The set of step-wedges were independently characterised for radiopacity at two University dental schools. Results: the percentage of aluminium together with the percentages of minor alloying elements (magnesium, manganese, iron and silicon) have been determined as mass percentages. For each centre, the optical density versus step-height for all wedges was judged to fall on a common curve, with the main exception of one step-wedge that was found to contain 4% copper, by mass. A suitable calculation procedure was described explicitly. Conclusion: of the examined representative step-wedges, all but the aluminium-4% copper material were satisfactory and gave results comparable with wedges of high purity. Limits should therefore be revised for composition of aluminium radiopacity step-wedges or test blocks to a more realistic level of purity. Alloys with more than 0.05% copper or 1.0% iron should be excluded and the aluminium content should be at least 98% by mass. In the calculations deployed for deriving radiopacity as 'equivalent aluminium thicknesses', an appropriate linear regression procedure should be employed and considerable care taken in the evaluation of materials of low or borderline radiopacity, relative to specification limits. The method described is principally suitable for materials with radiopacity greater than 1 mm. For materials with radiopacity less than 1 mm aluminium, thicker specimens (2 mm) should be used.

Total joint replacement of the hip or knee joint has become common treatment; at the same time, an increasing number of fractures are treated with osteosynthesis. The original Charnley low-friction arthroplasty of the hip is still widely used and gives in large series excellent results. Aseptic loosening of this arthroplasty has been thought to be due to wear debris of the methylmethacrylate used for fixation of the implants, or to debris generated from wear of the polyethylene socket. To date, many different materials have been tried in order to reduce wear and generation of macrophage irritating submicron sized particles, or to provide more biocompatible components. However, trials to improve the methylmethacrylate cement or to invent better polyethylenes have often failed. Diamond coating of the metallic components seems promising: there is less wear and diamond is very biocompatible in bulk and small particulate form. Biodegradable implants have also been found useful in treating fractures. Bioactive bioabsorbable materials may also make possible a tissue engineering approach and can be used as carriers for selected drugs and cytokines. Because many promising materials and designs have failed in clinical use, extensive theoretical and experimental testing is mandatory before introducing new materials and implants in a clinical setting.","Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland; Yamagata Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Yamagata 990, Japan; Hosp Nuestra Senora de Gracia, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Zaragoza, Spain; Univ Helsinki, Dept Anat, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland; Natl Agcy Med, Helsinki, Finland","Santavirta, S (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Topeliuksenkatu 5, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland.",Seppo.Santavirta@huch.fi,"GOMEZ-BARRENA, ENRIQUE/A-2799-2008","GOMEZ-BARRENA, ENRIQUE/0000-0003-1065-6137",,,,31,36,36,0,9,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Using this method, it is possible to fix poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels on polymer surfaces, e.g. on catheters, which drastically reduces the friction of these materials. Similarly, other biological relevant properties, especially reduced protein or bacteria adsorption can be achieved by choosing appropriate monomers. The substrate was first homogeneously dip-coated with e.g. the water-insoluble macroinitiator poly(octadecene-co-maleic anhydride), partially reacted to the tert.-butyl perester. Homogeneity, thickness, and reactivity of the macroinitiator layer was characterized in detail. After a temper step, surface homo- and copolymerizations of ionic monomers were carried out in water directly from the modified surface. The consistency of the hydrogel coating could be well controlled by the reaction conditions and the monomer composition. The correlation between the experimental parameters, the composition of the surface coating, and the friction properties was established. A relatively thick, slightly crosslinked poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel coating reduces the friction coefficient by 95% compared to that of uncoated surfaces.","Polymer Res Inst, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; CREAVIS, D-45764 Marl, Germany","Voit, BI (reprint author), Polymer Res Inst, Hohe Str 6, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",,"Voit, Brigitte/D-4755-2009; Umlauf, Ursula/D-3356-2014","Voit, Brigitte/0000-0002-4531-691X; ",,,,13,14,14,0,9,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",1060-1325,,,J MACROMOL SCI PURE,J.

Currently used methods, e.g. bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, show serious disadvantages concerning either sensitivity, specificity or handling. A new enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for the quantification of cell proliferation based on detection of the Ki-67 protein is described. This protein has turned out to be strictly correlated with the active parts of the cell cycle but to be absent in G(0). The measurement of Ki-67 expression by different human cell types, e.g. endothelial cells and HeLa cells, was evaluated in order to answer the question of whether the data obtained using the Ki-67 ELISA method correlate with the proliferation measured with flow cytometrical DNA analysis and microscopical evaluation. Methods currently used for the evaluation of cell proliferation were compared to the new Ki-67 ELISA method. In addition, the functionality of adherent endothelial cells, and the viability and morphology of the cells were investigated. Cells were treated with standard culture medium with or without the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, or growth factors, e.g. endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), and were exposed to metal ion standard solutions. These solutions were in a cytotoxic-non-cytotoxic range. Ki-67 ELISA was found to be a reliable quantitative method to assess proliferation of cultured human cells in vitro. It has advantages over methods that are currently being used. It is easy to perform and corresponds to the requirements for a test to be selected for biomaterial testing according to ISO standard 10 993.

In the present work we have studied the utility of a heparin-polypyrrole composite as a substrate for human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) growth. We found that the polymer composites were well suited to support cell attachment and growth; displaying low surface hydrophobicity (water contact angle of approximately 20 degrees) and roughness, R-q, of approximately 10-12 nm. Doubling times for HUVEC on heparin-polypyrrole were greater than observed for gelatin-coated tissue culture polystyrene (44 and 36 h, respectively), however, the cells did proliferate to cover the polymer in an even monolayer. The initial mechanism of attachment and subsequent proliferation of HUVEC on heparin-polypyrrole was critically dependent on the presence of the serum adhesion glycoprotein vitronectin. Polymers that were composed of polypyrrole and sodium nitrate were more hydrophobic than heparin-polypyrrole and they did not support HUVEC growth. Given the relative ease with which these polymer composites can be electrochemically synthesized, the diverse range of cellular ""signal agents"", e.g. growth factors, that can be incorporated within them, and the high degree of control that can be achieved in the release-surface exposure of these agents, we suggest that polypyrrole composites could serve a useful role as ""smart"" biomaterials in the near future.

To demonstrate the utility of this system, cell lines were developed which expressed human growth hormone (hGH) at levels exceeding 1 microgram per million cells per day. These were loaded into devices which were then implanted into juvenile nude rats. Significant levels of hGH of up to 2.5 ng/ml were detected in plasma throughout the six month duration of the study. In contrast, animals implanted with free cells showed peak plasma levels of 0.5 to 1.2 ng four days after implantation with no detectable hGH beyond 10 days. Histological examination of explanted devices showed they were vascularized and contained cells that were viable and morphologically healthy. After removal of the implants, no hGH could be detected which confirmed that the source of hGH was from cells contained within the device.

Design: Laboratory investigation using a polyvinylchloride pipe periarticular tibia fracture model. Setting: Simulated periarticular tibia fractures were created in a tibia model. Instrumented specimens were tested in a biomaterials resting system. Intervention: Groups of simulated periarticular tibia fractures were stabilized with one of nine different external fixation constructs with components from one manufacturer. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness was measured for each specimen in compression, torsion, flexion bending, extension bending, and varus and valgus bending. Results: The four-ring Ilizarov fixator was the stiffest in all modes of testing. There was a trend toward increasing stiffness with an increasing number of rings. Fixators constructed with multiple levels of fixation in the periarticular fragment were stiffer in all modes of testing, The additional spacing between wires gained by the use of a single thick carbon ring or the use of a drop wire three centimeters from a single ring did not increase stiffness in this model. Frame modifications intended to augment the bar-to-ring connection did not increase stiffness. The use of rings mounted with half-pins instead of a unilateral bar mounted with half-pins for diaphyseal fixation increased the stiffness of the frame only in torsional testing. Conclusions: Although the ideal stiffness of an external fixator is unknown, our results show that the addition of more than one level of fixation in the periarticular fragment increases the stiffness of hybrid external fixators in this periarticular tibia fracture model. Augmentation of the ring-to-bar connection did not significantly affect the stiffness of the Frame.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, Lexington, KY 40536 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Nashville, TN USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Rehabil, Nashville, TN USA","Pugh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, 740 S Limestone, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",,,,,,,22,27,29,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0890-5339,,,J ORTHOP TRAUMA,J.

The copolymers are polyester-polyamino acid hybrids, composed of a poly(L-lactic acid-co-L-lysine) (PLAL) backbone, and poly(L-lysine), poly(D,L-alanine) or poly(L-aspartic acid) side chains extending from the lysine residues of PLAL. The microparticles have been characterized with regard to their surface properties, morphology, and size. Thus, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis data and results of Zeta potential measurements suggest that the polyamino acid side chains tend to concentrate at the surface of the particles. Also, analyses by environmental scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy indicate that particles carrying poly(lysine) chains have an unusual porous structure, most probably due to the combined effects of the amphiphilic, polyelectrolyte, and chemical nature of the composing copolymer, as well as of the particular preparation technique employed. The capabilities of the microparticles to serve as carriers in controlled drug release and delivery devices were demonstrated by encapsulation and release of rhodamine B, a low molecular weight drug model.","MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Parma, Dipartimento Farmaceut, I-43100 Parma, Italy; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Langer, R (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, E25-342, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rlanger@mit.edu,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014; colombo, Paolo/I-3063-2012","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771; ",NIGMS NIH HHS [GM 26698],,,26,31,38,3,28,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037 USA",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

Study Design/Materials and Methods: A film solder consisted of a white layer (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and distilled water) and a black layer (BSA, carbon black (CB), and distilled water). This two-layer solder was used with a diode laser to weld sections of dog small intestine (lambda = 810 nm, power = 200 +/- 20 mW, radiation dose = 18 +/- 1 J/mg). Sections of intestine were welded only with one-layer black solders as control group. The temperature difference between the external solder surface and the tissue-solder interface was evaluated during welding. Results: The two-layer solder performed welds as strong as the one-layer solder (similar to 0.12 N) but with less laser intensity on the black layer. The temperature difference between the external surface of the solder and the solder-tissue interface was significantly less for the two-layer solder than for the one-layer solder (similar to 6 degrees C and similar to 15 degrees C, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The two-layer solder appeared to be more efficient at soldering biomaterials than the one-layer solder. Furthermore, the heat diffusion from the black midplane of the two-layer solder decreased the difference in temperature recorded on the solder external surface and on the solder-tissue interface.

The specific variation of the material composition represents one option to affect the surface properties and to investigate their influence at biocompatibility. In the present study such a synthesis variation of ceramic biomaterials within the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 was examined since by varying the material composition the surface energy can be varied and thus adapted to the requirements of the biosystem respectively the test cells. That's why for the planned in-vitro investigations ceramics on the basis of the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 with variable composition and sufficient densities were developed by means of soi-gel techniques. It could be demonstrated that the surface energy respectively the surface enthalpy can be affected by a variable material composition. In this context the silicon oxide seems to be of special importance. Thus it could be shown that if the concentration of silicon oxide increases surface tension and polarity of the examined material surface increases too. Although the realized in-vitro tests confirm a good biocompatibility of the involved ceramics concerning cell proliferation and metabolic activity a significant correlation between surface properties and the observed cellular response could not be detected. Probably this result is ascribable only to the comparatively small parameter variations which were achieved by varying the material composition. A direct correlation between the cell behavior and the composition of the investigated materials based on the interface energy concept could not be proved for the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 in the present study.,"Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, FB Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heiligenstadt, Germany; Univ Jena, Tech Inst, Lehrstuhl Mat Wissensch, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Frant, M (reprint author), Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, FB Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Articular cartilage chondrocytes from adult rabbit knees and from bovine calf metacarpophalangeal joints were isolated by enzymatic digestion and cultured in a monolayer system to amplify cell count. After amplification the cells were seeded on different biocompatible materials. We investigated two types of bioresorbable polymer fleece matrices (a composite fleece of polydioxanon and polyglactin and a resorbable poly-L-lactic acid fleece) and lyophilized dura as a biological carrier. On all three types of transport media the phenotypic and morphological appearance of cultured chondrocytes could be observed. The production of glycosaminoglycans was revealed by Alcian blue staining and immunohistochemical detection of Chondroitin-4 and 6-sulfate in the created constructs. The material properties of the carriers allow for transplantation of the artificial cartilage-like products into full thickness articular cartilage defects and could therefore improve the min or intrinsic healing capacity of cartilage tissue.

The Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu17.5 amorphous alloy showed as high polarization resistance as crystalline titanium in deaerated electrolyte with pH 7.5. With the small amount of chloride ion, this alloy did not show pitting corrosion on the polarization curve. Open-circuit potential which was always lower than pitting potential was ennobled with the decrease of pH The pitting potential was considerably ennobled by the dissolved oxygen because of the decrease of hydroxide ion and phosphate ion in the surface oxide. On the other hand, the extra oxygen retained nickel oxide in the surface film, causing the slight decrease of pitting potential. When titanium, niobium, indium, and tungsten were employed as M, the pitting potential of the Zr60M5Al7.5Cu27.5 amorphous alloys largely increased with the dissolved oxygen. The thermodynamic stability of oxide-state of these alloying elements was high. Those indicates that the pitting corrosion resistance of the alloy possibly increased by the small amount of oxide.","Natl Res Inst Met, Biomat Res Team, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hiromoto, S (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Met, Biomat Res Team, 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011",,,,,7,0,0,0,3,ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY INC,PENNINGTON,"65 S MAIN ST, PENNINGTON, NJ 08534-2839 USA",,,1-56677-250-8,ELEC SOC S,,,1999.0,99,27,,,,,505,512,,,,,,8,"Electrochemistry; Materials Science, Coatings & Films",Electrochemistry; Materials Science,BP90P,WOS:000086563500054,,,,,2019-02-25

For example, speckles generated by illuminating soft biological tissue with laser light are subject to rapid decorrelation due to the Brownian movement of water and scattering particles in the tissues and to cellular motions. In addition, the penetration of the laser beam into the tissue or translucent biomaterial results in multiple scattering and a complete depolarization of the speckle field. This may complicate the evaluation of the strain field when a force is applied to the material because the speckle pattern shift is providing information from the surface of the material as well as from the bulk sample, where the strains may or may not be the same as on the surface. This paper presents a variation of a speckle processing scheme originally called the 'Transform Method' for evaluating both surface and bulk strain rates and total strains in biological tissues and translucent biomaterials. The method is not a correlation based technique, but instead relies upon two-dimensional frequency transforms of time series of one-dimensional speckle pattern records stacked into two dimensional arrays. The method is insensitive to speckle field depolarization and, compared to correlation-based techniques, is relatively insensitive to speckle decorrelation. Strain rates and total in-plane strains were measured in both hard (cortical bone) and soft (artery segments) biological tissues and in translucent biomaterials (dental ceramics), Potential applications to medical diagnostics and biomaterials science are also discussed.","Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Biomat & Biomech, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3200-8,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3726,,,,,,504,511,,10.1117/12.341432,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics",Materials Science; Mechanics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics,BM94U,WOS:000080215700063,,,,,2019-02-25

The high lateral resolution is the result of a sudden increase in reflectivity when the tip goes close to the surface at about 50 % vibration damping. This technique has been tested for samples of practical importance in the field of organic colourants and for Raman spectroscopy. In the first example the radial distributions of different disperse dyes within polyester fibers have been studied. SNOM measurements on cross-sections of coloured fibers allow separating the fluorescence signal of the dyes out of the total internal reflection signal with appropriate filters. The fluorescence SNOM images allow to quantify the penetration (diffusion) of the dye into the fibers. Ring-dyed and uniformly dyed fibers can easily be distinguished. Local photobleaching of fluorescence is demonstrated. Topographic and optical images correspond precisely both in mu m scale and in nm scale scans. In the second example fluorescent nanoparticles (100 - 200 nm diameter) embedded in thin films of polyvidone were studied by SNOM and AFM. The optical images provide single spherical particles (of correct size) as well as larger aggregates. The emerging topographies are 10 nm wider than the fluorescence SNOM images which allows to estimate a 5 nm coverage of the resin. In the third example local Raman SNOM spectra of scratched Si and its SiO2 cover, as well as of GaN were measured with an optoacoustic single photon counting spectrometer at 488 nm excitation in collection times of 10 min. Possible applications to biomaterials are discussed.","Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany","Kaupp, G (reprint author), Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",,,,,,,13,7,7,0,8,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3077-3,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3607,,,,,,16,25,,10.1117/12.350632,,,,10,Medical Laboratory Technology; Microscopy; Optics,Medical Laboratory Technology; Microscopy; Optics,BN29F,WOS:000081436700003,,,,,2019-02-25

As a passivating treatment, electropolishing (EP) was demonstrated to decrease the amount of nickel on the surface and to remarkably improve the corrosion behavior of the alloy. After sterilization by ethylene oxide (EO), no modification of the promising corrosion behavior of electropolished NiTi were observed, although some surface modifications were reported.

These biocompatible protective layers have been deposited on various metallic (stainless steel, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys) and polymeric (polyethylene) substrates. Residual stress in deposited materials may lead to distortion of the crystal lattice, cracks in the film, or delamination of the film. Residual stresses consist of thermal stresses, which are induced at temperatures other than the deposition temperature if the coating and substrate have different thermal expansion coefficients, lattice-misfit stresses, which occur during epitaxial growth due to lattice parameter misfit, and surface-tension stresses, which arise when force fields are created by the surface tension between islands of deposits grown from substrate sites favorable for precipitation. Adhesion, fretting, adhesive wear, and hence abrasive (third-body) wear of diamond and diamondlike carbon films can be minimized by reducing local stress levels and increasing atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region. This review discusses schemes to reduce local film stress levels and increase atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region for diamond and diamondlike carbon coatings on metallic substrates and diamondlike carbon coatings on polyethylene. The hardness of diamondlike carbon films has been continuously varied by doping these films with silver and titanium. We have also created diamond/titanium carbide and diamond/aluminum nitride composites, in which the amount of sp(3)-bonded carbon increases with film thickness. We have also created enhanced film adhesion and wear via these functionally graded firms. Thus, by reducing local stress levels and increasing atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region, we can improve adhesion and wear of diamondlike carbon and diamond coatings for biomaterials.","Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Narayan, RJ (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",,"Narayan, Roger/J-2789-2013; Narayan, Jagdish/D-1874-2009","Narayan, Roger/0000-0002-4876-9869; ",,,,10,0,0,0,4,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-427-5,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,355,365,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Coatings & Films",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM95J,WOS:000080238600032,,,,,2019-02-25

Successful production of BMPs through recombinant DNA technology provides an opportunity to constitute new artificial implants with bone-inducing capacity by combining with synthetic implants. To build these bioactive implants, degradable polymer materials were synthesized, mixed with BMP and screened for their capacity to induce bone in an in vivo system. Implants consisting of polylactic acid (PLA) polymers and its derivative polymers with liquid and plastic properties in combination with rBMP consistently induced new bone in mice within a few weeks after implantation. Our data and the work of others suggest that these reconstituted bone-inducing materials have the potential to substitute bone grafts in the healing of fractures or repair of bone defects. The combination of this hybrid material with porous solid biomaterials could provide a bone-inducing implant with mechanical strength. Further preclinical and clinical work to check the safety of these implants will be necessary before they are adopted for widespread clinical use.","Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Takaoka, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Asahi 3-1-1, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0531-5131,,0-444-50029-4,INT CONGR SER,,,1999.0,1175,,,,,,141,151,,,,,,11,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Materials Science,BN11S,WOS:000080759400015,,,,,2019-02-25

Consequently, the treatment of chronic wounds with keratinocytes may be promising. Cell culture technology allows to expand keratinocytes up to 6000-fold in vitro after taking a single biopsy from patient. Today the transplantation of these in vitro cultured keratinocytes in different modifications is an established clinical treatment regimen for therapy of extensive wounds. For example, keratinocyte-fibrin-glue-suspensions, mainly consisting of proliferative epidermal basal cells, were used for the treatment of burns in experimental and clinical settings to bypass the disadvantages of conventional sheet grafts. Other approaches in tissue engineering for wound healing aim at the (epi-)dermal repair by the combination of allodermis and biomaterials, i.e. collagen-sponges and microspheres. Due to most recent efforts in keratinocyte culture techniques, developments in tissue engineering, research for novel biomaterials and gene therapy, therapy of chronic wounds may prove to be more efficient. Furthermore, from the socio-economical point of view, overall costs for treatment of chronic wounds could be reduced.","Univ Freiburg, Klinikum, Abt Plast & Handchirurg, Freiburg, Germany","Tanczos, E (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Chirurg Klin, Abt Plast & Handchirurg, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",,,"Horch, Raymund E./0000-0002-6561-2353",,,,23,10,10,0,1,JOHANN AMBROSIUS BARTH VERLAG,HEIDELBERG,"IM WEIHER 10, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0044-409X,,,ZBL CHIR,Zent.bl.

Chitin, extracted from shells of Penaeus vannamei, yielded chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 70% and molecular weight of 250 000 D. The copolymer consists of (beta-(1-4)-2-2-acetamido-D-glucose) units linked to (beta-(1-4)-2-amino-D-glucose) units. Since the main interest of this work was to study the surface properties of films on substrates, a method to cast this material onto Al-coated silicon wafers had to be developed. X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to determine the surface composition of the unmodified films and to follow modification changes. The films were treated in either an oxygen plasma environment or under UV/ozone irradiation. Water advancing contact angle measurements and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to complement XPS measurements. The films appeared to orient on the silicon wafer surface in the type II chitin structure. The rates of oxidation are faster for the plasma process but they result in similar changes to those induced by UV/ozone treatment. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) clearly shows the advantage of the milder modification reaction without much change in surface morphology. The oxidation processes, as detected by XPS, proceed without much alteration of the amine nitrogen atoms but carbonyl containing moieties are formed as a function of treatment time. Specific reactions with a fluorosilane to measure the activity of hydroxyl groups indicate that at short treatment times, these groups are essentially inactive. The resulting surfaces can also serve as a potential way to induce silica-like domains that can function as diffusion barriers. Irradiation of chitosan solution shows that UV/ozone induces depolymerization. In both cases, i.e. plasma and UV/ozone reactions, the main active component to surface modification appears to be UV irradiation with a wavelength below 360 nm.","IBM Corp, Microelect Div, Endicott, NY 13760 USA","Matienzo, LJ (reprint author), IBM Corp, Microelect Div, Endicott, NY 13760 USA.",,,,,,,40,41,42,0,27,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1438-7492,,,MACROMOL MATER ENG,Macromol.

Open-circuit potential of titanium decreased with L929 cells, which was caused by the shift of equilibrium potential between cathodic and anodic reactions indicated by the decrease in cathodic current density with L929 cells. In cathodic potential step test, the decrease in current density following to the peak current density was delayed with L929 cells, indicating that diffusivity of molecules and ions decreased with the cells. In addition, alternating current impedance measurement and data approximation to the electrical equivalent circuit model revealed that the circuit element for diffusion resistance of biomolecule adsorption layer increased with L929 cells. Consequently, the effect of cells on the interface property is the retardation of diffusion through the biomolecule adsorption layer due to the increase in biomolecule density with extracellular matrix consisting with proteins and glycosaminoglycans generated by the cells.

However, the Ni(II) complex shows better catalytic property than other complexes on the polymerization and the molecular weight (MW) of poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) produced. With a rise in temperature and a prolongation of time, the MW of PLA decreased remarkably. The MW of PLA prepared by all complexes is not very high, which might be related to the crystalline water of complexes.

The mechanism(s) involved in the inflammatory responses, which can be arbitrarily divided into phagocyte transmigration, chemotaxis, and adhesion to implant surfaces, are not totally understood. Because adhesion molecules have been shown to involved in phagocyte transmigration, this study was designed to investigate the participation of endothelial adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses and fibrotic tissue formation. Using transgenic adhesion molecule knockout mice, we found that (1) deficiency of P-selectin reduced polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) but not macrophages/ monocytes (M(D) transmigration and adhesion. (2) Furthermore, absence of both P- and E-selectin (P/E-deficient) dramatically diminished both PMN and M(D recruitment to the peritoneal cavity and accumulation on implanted biomaterials. (3) Finally, the impairment of inflammatory responses in P/E-deficient mice significantly reduced the extent of subsequent biomaterial-mediated fibrotic responses. We conclude that P- and E-selectins are important for both biomaterial-mediated inflammatory and fibrotic reactions. Our results also indicate that the reduction of phagocyte accumulation might be responsible to the decrease of fibrotic tissue formation surrounding material implants. Better understanding of such sequence of events may:help the rational design of biomaterials with desired tissue reactivity.

The monoacrylated phospholipid monomer was initially synthesized and prepared as unilamellar vesicles with varying molar concentrations of TM. Notably, in mixed-lipid systems, K-m values for protein C activation increased in direct proportion to the mole fraction of polymerizable lipid, which was likely due to reduced membrane mobility after photopolymerization. Membrane-mimetic films were also constructed on planar substrates with predictable surface concentrations of catalytically active TM. Significantly, at a TM surface concentration of 170 fmol/cm(2), the rate of protein C activation was comparable to that measured for a variety of confluent endothelial cell monolayers. Serial measurements of contact angles and protein C activation confirmed short-term film stability under a variety of in vitro conditions. Moreover, I-125 labeling of TM demonstrated little change in TM surface concentration over periods of up to 28 days. Significantly, polymeric lipid membranes functionalized with thrombomodulin efficiently inhibited thrombin generation. We believe that the design of membrane-mimetic films that have the capacity to activate the protein C pathway will provide a useful strategy for generating ""actively"" antithrombogenic surfaces.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Lab Biomol Mat Res, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Chaikof, EL (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Lab Biomol Mat Res, 1639 Pierce Dr 5105 WMB, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,35,17,18,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,DEC 10,2002.0,18,25,,,,,9907,9913,,10.1021/la025931y,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,623TU,WOS:000179719600043,,,,,2019-02-25

Compounds with neoalkoxy titanate or zirconate coupling agents were also produced to improve interfacial interaction and filler dispersion in the composites. The composites were molded into tensile test bars using (i) conventional injection molding and (ii) shear-controlled orientation in injection molding (SCORIM). This latter molding technique was used to deliberately induce a strong anisotropic character to the composites. The mechanical characterization included tensile testing and microhardness measurements. The morphology of the moldings was studied by both polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the structure developed was assessed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The reinforcing effect of HA particles was found to depend on the molding technique employed. The higher mechanical performance of SCORIM processed composites results from the much higher orientation of the matrix and, to a lesser extent, from the superior degree of filler dispersion compared with conventional moldings. The strong anisotropy of the SCORIM moldings is associated with a clear laminated morphology developed during shear application stage. The titanate and the zirconate coupling agents caused significant variations in the tensile test behavior, but their influence was strongly dependent on the molding technique employed. The application of shear associated with the use of coupling agents promotes the disruption of the HA agglomerates and improves mechanical performance.

The main goals with the plasma treatment of the different plastics were to hydrophilize the surfaces and to provide good cell culture properties. Surfaces treated at high RF power/gas flow ratios (50 to 100 W/sccm) became highly hydrophilic (water contact angles of about 5 degrees) and stable towards washing in 70% (v/v) ethanol. Those treated at lower power/gas flow ratios (3 to 10 W/sccm) were less hydrophilic and not wash-stable. Cell growth properties of HeLa cervix carcinoma cells as good as on commercial tissue-culture polystyrene could be obtained for Zeonex, SAN, and PS, treated at relatively low RF power/gas flow ratios. However, no untreated plastics were suitable for culturing these cells. XPS spectra features show that ester, ether/alcohol, and ester/carboxyl groups are formed during the plasma treatments of the different plastics. Measurable amounts of carboxylic acid carbon after plasma treatment were only observed for PS and Topas. Furthermore, at high RF power/gas flow ratios fluorine, aluminium and silicon were incorporated in all investigated plastics surfaces due to ablation-deposition processes in the reaction chamber.

Biomaterials, and multifilaments in particular, are thought to increase the risk of infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to study the influence of the presence of either a monofilament or a multifilament mesh material on the bacterial infection risk. The filament surface of a monofilament and a multifilament mesh were calculated on the basis of a theoretical model. The adherence of Staphylococcus aureus was measured in vitro by fluorescence analysis. Additionally, the two mesh materials (8-mm platelets) were implanted subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley rats with daily surveillance for clinical signs of infection. After 7 days the meshes were explanted for histological and microbiological analysis. Calculations of the mesh surface area revealed a higher level for the multifilament mesh. The extent of adherent bacteria corresponded to the estimated filament surface in vitro. In vivo, the implantation of meshes in the presence of 5 x 10(6) S. aureus did not show an increased infection rate in rats with either monofilament or multifilament material, compared to the control groups (mesh implantation without S. aureus contamination). However, after 7 days bacteria were still detectable in the majority of the implantation sites, and a clinically inapparent intensification of local inflammation and fibrosis was induced. The increased surface area of a multifilament meshes promotes the persistence of bacteria in the implant bed, though this alone is not sufficient to create a clinically apparent infection. This might explain the development of mesh-related infections after a delay of several months or even years. In vivo, the adherence of bacteria to the implant material depends on the surface area, which favors the use of monofilament materials.

In the absence of urinary infection, calcium oxallate is the prevalent encrustation mineral formed. Considering this, a novel approach was taken in the study reported here, in that an oxalate-degrading enzyme, oxalate oxidase (OXO), was immobilized on the surface of silicone elastomer (PDMS), a common urological biomaterial. It was hypothesized that the enzymatic action of OXO could lower urinary oxalate levels near the device surface, thereby preventing calcium oxalate crystal formation. The PDMS surface was functionalized with the use of radio-frequency plasma discharge (RFPD) in the presence of water vapor, then coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (AMEO). The resulting aminated surface was covalently coupled with OXO via glutaraldehyde bioconjugation. The ability of the OXO-coated PDMS to prevent calcium oxalate encrustation was evaluated with the use of a modified Robbins device (MRD) encrustation model. RFPD performed on PDMS resulted in an increase in the hydrophilicity of treated surfaces, as measured by contact angle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies showed increases in elemental oxygen, after water-vapor plasma, and in nitrogen after AMEO derivatization. The immobilized enzyme was shown to retain 47.5% of its specific enzymatic activity as compared to free enzyme. In vitro experiments for 6 days, with the use of a MRD, showed 53% less encrustation deposits on discs coated with OXO than control discs. The results from the current study suggest that PDMS-immobilized oxalate-degrading enzymes are active against calcium oxalate encrustation. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals.

Large-scale application of the technique, however, is hampered by insufficient biocompatibility of the capsules with failure of the grafts as a consequence. Most studies addressing biocompatibility issues of alginate-PLL capsules have focused on the degree of overgrowth on the capsules after graft failure and not on the reaction against the capsules in the immediate posttrans-plant period. Therefore, capsules were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of rats and retrieved 1, 5, and 7 days later for histological examination and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis for evaluation of chemical changes at the capsule surface. After implantation, the nitrogen signal increased from 5% on day 0, to 8.6% on day 7, illustrating protein adsorption on the capsule's surface. This increase in protein content of the membrane was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of overgrown capsules from 0.5 +/- 0.3% on day 1 to 3.3 +/- 1.6% on day 7. The cellular overgrowth was composed of monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, fibroblasts, erythrocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and basophils. This overgrowth was not statical as generally assumed but rather dynamic as illustrated by our observation that at day 1 after implantation we mainly found monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes that on later time points were substituted by fibroblasts. As the inflammatory reaction predictably interfere with survival of encapsulated cells, efforts should be made to suppress activities or recruitment of inflammatory cells. These efforts may be temporary rather than permanent because most inflammatory cells have disappeared after 2 weeks of implantation.

The incorporation of PVP-I offered antimicrobial activity to the biomaterials. Films were characterised in terms of mechanical (tensile analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) and surface properties (dynamic contact angle analysis, scanning electron microscopy), whereas degradation (at 37degreesC in PBS at pH 7.4) was determined gravimetrically. The resistance of the films to encrustation was evaluated using an in vitro encrustation model. Reductions in the ratio of high:low-m.wt. PCL significantly reduced the ultimate tensile strength, % elongation at break and the advancing contact angle of the films. These effects were attributed to alterations in the amorphous content and the more hydrophilic nature of the films. Conversely, there were no alterations in Young's modulus, the viscoelastic properties and glass-transition temperature. Incorporation of PVP-I did not affect the mechanical or rheological properties of the films, indicative of a limited interaction between the two polymers in the solid state. Manipulation of the high:low m.wt. ratio of PCL significantly altered the degradation of the films, most notably following longer immersion periods, and resistance to encrustation. Accordingly, maximum degradation and resistance to encrustation was observed with the biomaterial composed of 40:60 high:low m.wt. ratios of PCL; however, the mechanical properties of this system were considered inappropriate for clinical application. Films composed of either 50:50 or 60:40 ratio of high:low m.wt. PCL offered an appropriate compromise between physicochemical properties and resistance to encrustation. This study has highlighted the important usefulness of degradable polymer systems as ureteral biomaterials.

In this in vitro study, we have investigated the surface properties of a hydrophilic polyvinyl pyrollidone) (PVP)-coating applied to polyurethane and determined its suitability for use as a urinary tract biomaterial by comparing its lubricity and ability to resist bacterial adherence and encrustation with that of uncoated polyurethane and silicone. The PVP-coated polyurethane was significantly more hydrophilic and more lubricious than either uncoated polyurethane or silicone. Adherence of a hydrophilic Escherichia coli isolate to PVP-coated polyurethane and uncoated polyurethane was similar but significantly less than adherence to silicone. Adherence of a hydrophobic Enterococcus faecalis isolate to PVP-coated polyurethane and silicone was similar but was significantly less than adherence to uncoated polyurethane. Struvite encrustation was similar on the PVP-coated polyurethane and silicone but significantly less than on uncoated polyurethane. Furthermore, hydroxyapatite encrustation was significantly less on the PVP-coated polyurethane than on either uncoated polyurethane or silicone. The results suggest that the PVP-coating could be useful in preventing complications caused by bacterial biofilm formation and the deposition of encrustation on biomaterials implanted in the urinary tract and, therefore, warrants further evaluation.

These mechanisms must be understood if surfaces are to be proactively designed to control protein adsorption behavior. Concepts widely employed in rational drug design and in protein and RNA folding predictions provide a means to approach this problem. Accordingly, a theoretical analysis has been conducted to estimate the thermodynamic contributions (changes in enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy) for the adsorption of selected individual mid-chain protein residues to functionalized surfaces. Enthalpic contributions from residue surface interactions were calculated using semi-empirical quantum mechanical-based computational chemistry methods in a simulated aqueous environment (MOPAC/COSMO), and enthalpic and entropic contributions due to water restructuring effects assumed to occur during adsorption were estimated from experimental data for functional group wetting and calculated changes in solvent accessible surface area as each protein residue approached each surface. When combined with intraprotein residue residue interactions, the understanding of residue-surface adsorption energy relationships provides a means to begin to predict protein adsorption behavior as a function of biomaterials surface chemistry. It is recognized that several assumptions have been made in this approach that could be challenged, and that truncations necessary due to programming limitations have been applied that may neglect potentially important interactions. Therefore, it must be understood that the modeling predictions may not be directly applicable to biomaterials for surface design under actual physiologic conditions at this stage. However, this attempt at modeling fundamental components of protein adsorption is presented as an initial approach to understanding these complex events. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The extent of modification with acetylthio groups can be made as high as 0.45 mmol/g. After deprotection of acetylthio groups and reaction of the resulting thiol groups with an excess of Ellman's reagent, 0.1 nmol/cm(2) of thiol-reactive 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyidithio groups were detected on the surface of films cast from the modified polymer.

PEG coatings were prepared by grafting methoxy-terminated aldehyde-PEG (MW 5000 Da) onto two amino-functionalised surfaces with different amine group densities, generated by radio frequency glow discharge polymerisation of n-heptylamine and allylamine. Grafting was performed at the lower critical solution temperature to maximise the graft density of the PEG chains. XPS showed that the grafted density of PEG chains was slightly higher on the allylamine surface. XPS detected no adsorption of either protein on either PEG coating. ToF-SIMS analysis, on the other hand, found, in the positive ion spectra, minute but statistically significant signals assignable to amino acid fragment ions from both proteins adsorbed to the lower density PEG coating and from LYS but not FN on the higher density PEG coating. Negative ion spectra contained relatively more intense protein fragment ion signals for the lower density PEG coating but no changes assignable to adsorbed proteins on the higher density PEG coating. These results demonstrate the importance of utilising highly sensitive techniques to study protein adsorption on surfaces intended to be protein resistant, and that both positive and negative ion ToF-SIMS spectra should be acquired to probe for possible very low levels of protein adsorption.

The extent of crosslinking, evaluated as difference between the number of free a-amino groups before and after crosslinking, increases as a function of genipin concentration up to about 85%. Simultaneously, the deformability of the films decreases whereas the Young's modulus E, increases. Furthermore, crosslinking provokes a significant reduction of the swelling in physiological solution, and enhances the thermal stability of the samples, as indicated by the results of the d.s.c. investigation. The data obtained from the films treated with genipin at concentrations higher than 0.67% are quite similar, and indicative of a good stabilizing effect of genipin. In spite of the small gelatin release (2%) observed after I month of storage in buffer solution, the mechanical, thermal and swelling properties of the films are very close to those previously obtained for glutaraldehyde crosslinked gelatin, and suggest that genipin, which is by far less cytotoxic, can be considered a valid alternative for crosslinking gelatin biomaterials.

A Ni-free zone was found in the oxide layer for oxidation temperatures of 500 degreesC and 600 degreesC. The oxidation at 500 degreesC produces a smooth protective nickel-free oxide layer with a relatively small amount of Ni species at the air/ oxide interface, which is in favour of good biocompatibility of NiTi implants.

For example, photopolymerizable biomaterials have been developed that can be used to photoencapsulate cells in peptide-derivatized hydrogel networks. While these materials have been useful in bone, cartilage and vascular tissue engineering, they have limited applicability to more complex tissues that are characterized by precise cell and tissue organization (e.g. liver, kidney). Typically, the tissue shape has been defined solely by the container used for photopolymerization. In this paper, we describe the use of photolithographic techniques to broaden the capability of photopolymerizable PEG-based biomaterials by inclusion of structural features within the cell/hydrogel network. Specifically, we describe the development of a photopatterning technique that allows localized photoencapsulation of live mammalian cells to control the tissue architecture. In this study, we optimized the effect of ultraviolet (UV) exposure and photoinitiator concentration on both photopatterning resolution and cell viability. With regard to photopatterning resolution, we found that increased UV exposure broadens feature size, while photoinitiator concentration had no significant effect on patterning resolution. Cell viability was characterized using HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. We observed that UV exposure itself did not cause cell death over the doses and time scale studied, while the photoinitiator 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl-acetophenone was itself cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the combination of UV and photoinitiator was the least biocompatible condition presumable due to formation of toxic free radicals. The utility of this method was demonstrated by photopatterning hydrogels containing live cells in various single layer structures, patterns of multiple cellular domains in a single ""hybrid"" hydrogel layer, and patterns of multiple cell types in multiple layers simulating use in a tissue engineering application. The combination of microfabrication approaches with photopolymerizable biomaterials will have implication sin tissue engineering, elucidating fundamental structure-function relationships of tissues, and formation of immobilized cell arrays for biotechnological applications.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Bhatia, SN (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0412, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,24,283,291,4,88,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-2176,,,BIOMED MICRODEVICES,Biomed.

Our previous studies analyzed the effect of these amino acids on rat osteoblast cultures and in experimental animals. In this study, we evaluated the effect of L-Arg and L-Lys on cultured human osteoblasts. Primary human osteoblast cultures were divided into four groups: the Arg Group received 0.625 mg/ml per day of Arg, the Lys Group 0.587 mg/ml per day of Lys, the Arg-Lys Group received both amino acids, whereas the Control Group was sham-treated. After 7 days, the following parameters were tested in all groups: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), nitric oxide (NO), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), osteocalcin (OC), type I collagen (PICP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on culture supernatant, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and MTT proliferation test on cells. Arg administration significantly increased ALP, NO, PICP and IGF-I production and reduced the level of IL-6. Lys administration over the same time interval mainly affected cell proliferation, as evidenced by the MTT test and immunostaining for PDGF. The same positive effects evidenced by the single administrations of the two amino acids resulted from their simultaneous administration. However, synergism could be demonstrated only for the decrease in the level of IL-6. Arg and Lys show a positive effect on human osteoblasts, which is related partly to the production of those factors required for matrix synthesis, and partly to the direct or mediated activation of cell proliferation.

Phys. Lipids 110 (2001) 27). However, the role of thermal induced mechanical responses of phospholipid bilayer on the contact mechanics of liposome adhering on a cationic substrate has not been determined. In this study, confocal-reflectance interference contrast microscopy, phase contrast microscopy and contact mechanics modeling are applied to probe the adhesion mechanisms of liposomes in the presence of electrostatic interactions during the thermotropic transition of the lipid bilayer. When temperature increases from 23 to 49 C at pH 7.4, the degree of liposome deformation (a/R) and adhesion energy of dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposome increases by 10% and remains constant, respectively, on 3-amino-propyl-triethoxy-silane (APTES) modified substrate. The extents of increase in these two parameters are highly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the rigid substrate. At pH 4, the adhesion energies above and below the phase transition temperature (T.) are increased by one order of magnitude due to the formation of the free silanol groups on APTES substrate. In hypotonic condition, the degree of vesicle deformation remains constant and the adhesion energy reduces by 20% during sample heating. Under all conditions, the adhesion energy of the adhering liposome spans a few orders of magnitude against the increase of liposome size as the surface area to volume ratio is maximized in smallest vesicle.

A biomaterial can be used alone (e.g. as a graft) or as a component of a medical device (e.g. a heart valve). Although the distinction between a biomaterial and a medical device is often blurred, it may carry medico-legal implications. There are currently five types of biomaterials in use: polymers, composites, metals and alloys, ceramics (often used in combination with metals) and biological materials. Polymers have the advantage of being tailorable and cheap, and are used in catheters and sutures. Biologicals are used for complex function replacement in soft tissue augmentation and vascular grafts. Biomaterials used in surgical repair may be further categorised as synthetic or natural, and absorbable or non-absorbable. A recent development has been the use of natural biomaterials to promote new tissue growth in areas of disease or defective tissue. One advantage of natural over synthetic products is that revascularisation of the tissue allows the graft to be left in place in the presence of infection while antibiotics are administered. Natural biomaterials include: cadaveric allografts, autografts of autologous tissue (e.g. rectus fascia), and acellular collagen grafts such as those derived from porcine dermis (Pelvicol(TM) Implant).

We review the use of natural and synthetic implant materials in reconstructive urology and examine how these new biomaterials may behave in the management of those patients with surgical complications. We describe our experience with a new collagen biomaterial (Pelvicol(TM) Implant) in reconstructive urology and present a new technique for the surgical repair of cystocoele using a modified Raz surgical procedure for cystocoele grade III repair. Methods: Patients underwent either a Raz classical repair using polyglactin mesh (n = 30) or a modified Raz technique using Pelvicol(TM) Implant as a plug of overlay material (n = 28). Results: Preliminary results are presented with a mean follow-up of 9.3 months. There were no recurrences in the Pelvicol(TM) Implant group compared with three recurrences in the control group. Furthermore, there were no erosions or infections in the Pelvicol(TM) Implant group. The modified Raz technique prolonged the operation time by only 10 minutes. Conclusions: In vaginal reconstruction surgery, the ultimate goal is not only to mend damaged tissue, but also to replace or regenerate the tissue by sustaining it on some form of matrix. The second generation of biomaterials currently being evaluated provide great potential to achieve this objective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Patients and Methods: Sling procedures using the Pelvicol(TM) Implant were carried out in 27 patients (age range 3 176 years; average 52 years) with genuine stress incontinence over a 12-month period. Patients had primary genuine stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (n = 14), and mixed SUI complicated by complaints of urgency or frequency and a previous history of surgery (n = 13). Detrusor instability was ruled out in all patients via cystometry, and patients were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. Results: In patients with genuine SUI, 86% of patients remained dry. In patients with mixed SUI, a small number of retentions and de novo urgencies were observed and 62% of patients remained dry. The mean time to insert the sling was 20 minutes and mean operation time was 45 minutes. There were no serious bleeds or infections. Three bladder perforations occurred, but the slings were repositioned with no further problems. Conclusions: This new surgical procedure can be used either as a tension-free sling in Type II patients or as a classical sling in complicated Type III incontinence patients. It is easy to teach and perform, it is fast and cost-effective, and it provides a good alternative to TVT. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The focus of research has changed in recent years from the macroscopic to the microscopic view, with attention shifting from mechanical macrodevices such as prostheses, catheters, and slings to the cell unit, with increasing attention being given to in vitro cell cultures. Novel techniques such as gene therapy and tissue engineering have only recently been introduced to the field of urology, and prospective biocompatibility studies are needed to establish appropriate standards of consistency. The development of new biomaterials will require a poly-disciplinary approach involving engineers, biologists and physicians, and will increasingly rely on specialised centres of biocompatibility research, and close cooperation between basic biosciences and clinical practice. The synthetic biomaterials of the future will have virtually unlimited mechanical properties, allowing them to be applied to more specific uses. There will be a move towards materials with a minimal risk of infection, erosion, mineral deposition, particle migration and adverse reactions, yet having long-term durability. However, it is unlikely that any synthetic material can ever be as durable as a natural or a nature-like biomaterial in the long-term.

A comparative series was carried out using either Pelvicol(TM) Implant, or posterior Intravaginal Slingplasty (IVS) combined with bridge or posterior repair. Methods: Between October 2000 and October 2001, 104 patients were treated with Pelvicol(TM) Implant (without additional IVS implants). Pelvicol(TM) Implant was placed in an anterior (n = 14), posterior (n = 80) or anterior and posterior (n = 10) position. The minimum follow-up period was more than 6 months, with investigations carried out every 6 months during the follow-up period. Results: The local performance of Pelvicol(TM) Implant was superior to that of conventional treatment. Complications with Pelvicol(TM) Implant were rare with few observed cases of expulsion, recurrence, shrinkage, induration, dyspareunia, or urgency-frequency syndrome. There were no reports of dyspareunia among any of the sexually active patients getting sufficient (local or systemic) estrogens. In addition, there were no reported infections. Although patients experienced a rise in temperature on the second and third day after surgery with a corresponding increase in serum levels of C-reactive protein, temperatures had normalised by days 4 and 5 post-operation, followed by normalisation of serum C-reactive protein levels. Conclusions: The migration of cells, ingrowth of tissue, vascularisation and collagen formation in and around Pelvicol(TM) Implant reported by other groups obviously are properties that lead to a very pleasing result after conclusion of the healing process. Long-term results have to follow this preliminary report. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To determine in vivo behavior of the ability of the Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 14990) to attach to 120 intraocular lenses (IOLs) made of five different biomaterials: fluorine polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), heparinized PMMA, silicone, hydrophobic acrylic, and hydrogel. The pig was chosen as an animal model of endophthalmitis, after a bibliographical analysis and a personal study of its aqueous humor composition. METHODS. Crystalline lenses from 90 domestic pigs were removed aseptically and replaced with previously infected IOLs' The animals were killed 24 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week after implantation of the IOLs. The extent of bacterial binding was then measured by counting. Results were compared with a two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA 2), confirmed by the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test. RESULTS. The extent of bacterial binding (expressed as bound bacteria per area unit) was found to range in increasing order from hydrogel, to fluorine PMMA, to hydrophobic acrylic, to heparinized PMMA, to silicone polymer. Comparison of pairs of materials showed statistically significant differences, except between hydrogel and fluorine PMMA. CONCLUSIONS. To the authors' knowledge, no study has been published so far concerning the in vivo evolution of populations of bacteria adhering to different intraocular materials. Bacterial adhesion to the implant surface must therefore depend on the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the biomaterial. Adhesion is also affected by the nature,of the surrounding medium. Because of its complexity, the latter appears to be very difficult to model, thus making in vivo studies. essential.","Hop Edouard Herriot, Dept Ophthalmol, F-69003 Lyon, France; Vet Dept, Marcy Letoile, France; Univ Lyon, Dept Microbiol, Lyon, France; Univ Lyon, Dept Biochem, Lyon, France","Kodjikian, L (reprint author), Hop Edouard Herriot, Dept Ophthalmol, EA 3090,5 Pl Arsonval, F-69003 Lyon, France.",kodjikian.laurent@wanadoo.fr,"burillon, carole/C-5989-2014","burillon, carole/0000-0002-1850-9038",,,,29,38,39,0,9,ASSOC RESEARCH VISION OPHTHALMOLOGY INC,ROCKVILLE,"12300 TWINBROOK PARKWAY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852-1606 USA",0146-0404,1552-5783,,INVEST OPHTH VIS SCI,Invest.

We functionalized a silastic membrane and treated it with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS). A minimal RGD peptide was then covalently linked to the aminated surface. MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells were cultured on the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-treated membrane for 3-15 days and cell attachment and proliferation was evaluated. We observed that cells were immediately bound to the membrane and proliferated. After 8 days on the material surface, osteoblasts exhibited high levels of ALP staining, indicating that the cells were undergoing maturation. Alizarin red staining and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis showed that the mineral formed by the cells was a biological apatite. The second objective was to apply a mechanical force to cells cultured on the modified silicone membrane. Dynamic equibiaxial strain, 2% magnitude, and a 0.25-Hz frequency were applied to bone cells for 2 It. Osteoblasts elicited increased phalloidin fluorescence, suggesting that there was reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the applied strain elicited increased expression of the a,133 integrin receptor. We concluded that the covalent binding of RGD peptides to a silicone membrane provides a compatible surface for the attachment and subsequent differentiation of osteoblasts. Moreover, the engineered surface transduces applied mechanical forces directly to the adherent cells via integrin receptors.","Jefferson Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, Orthoped Res Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Dent Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Ctr Bioact Mat & Tissue Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Cavalcanti-Adam, EA (reprint author), Jefferson Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, Orthoped Res Lab, Room 501,Curtis Bldg,1015 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",,,"Adams, Christopher/0000-0003-2100-4417",NIDDK NIH HHS [1R01DK45419]; NHLBI NIH HHS [1R01HL60426],,,39,40,45,1,16,AMER SOC BONE & MINERAL RES,WASHINGTON,"2025 M ST, N W, STE 800, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-3309 USA",0884-0431,,,J BONE MINER RES,J.

A common feature of these organisms, when in anhydrobiosis, is the presence of large amounts of sugar, particularly trehalose, which has been found to protect most effectively biomaterials. Several studies have attempted to understand how trehalose interacts with biomolecules. To address this problem, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of carboxy-myoglobin embedded in a trehalose aqueous solution and in a trehalose-water plasticized amorphous matrix. The results show that, in an aqueous solution, trehalose is excluded from the protein domain. This behavior extends also to the trehalose-water plasticized amorphous matrix, where we find sugar-water-protein structures with more water molecules that those derived from system concentration, and only few trehalose molecules bound to the protein, mainly through single hydrogen bonds.

However, no comparison between GDP+ and GDP- has been reported. In this study, a titanium surface pre-treated with GDP+ and GDP- was characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the wettability of the titanium surface was measured with and without GDP. Furthermore, XPS characterized the adsorption of inorganic ions on titanium surfaces with and without GDP and immersed in an electrolyte solution. The findings suggested that GDP+ enhances calcium phosphate nucleation, due to the accumulation of electrons. In addition, calcium phosphate was not nucleated on the specimen with GDP-.

In this work, electrospun poly(meta-phenylene isophthalamide) (MPD-I) nanofibers were used as substrates for creating nanoscale structures out of carbon-based materials and metals. MPD-I was used because it can be electrospun into nanofibers with diameters smaller than 10 nm and it has good thermal stability. MPD-I nanofibers were coated with carbon, copper, and aluminum using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition methods.

Ti) dental implants is one of the most influencing factors in the improvement of their osseointegration. In this sense, previously, a two-step method (2S) for obtaining bioactive blasted-rough titanium surfaces was developed for improving short-term (due to its bioactivity) and long-term (due to its roughness) osseointegration. This 2S-method consists of: (1) Grit blasting on titanium surface in order to roughen it, and (2) thermo-chemical (TCh) treatment in order to obtain a bioactive surface with bone-bonding ability. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the in vitro human-osteoblast response (proliferation, differentiation - ALP activity- and cell morphology-studied by environmental scanning electron microscopy) of rough c.p. Ti (grit blasted), bioactive c.p. Ti (thermo-chemically treated) and rough-bioactive c.p. Ti (2S-treated). Different grit materials (Al2O3 and SiC) have been used in order to investigate their influence. The results showed that cell adhesion was statistically higher for the rough and bioactive surfaces, whatever the grit used. Cells proliferated very well on all the c.p. Ti surfaces. If comparing groups with and without TCh (all other treatments being equal) the ALP was always higher in the groups with TCh, indicating stimulation of osteoblast differentiation because of TCh, more significantlly in the groups that were first blasted. Those ALP results were accompanied by a decrease in the value of proliferation, which shows the good behavior of the cells. This results suggest that a rough and bioactive-titanium surface obtained by 2S-treatment enhances adhesion and differentiation activity of human osteoblasts cells.

As an alternative to the more typical bioactive glass percursors, a sodium silicate gel is being employed as a nucleating agent, for inducing the formation of a calcium-phosphate (Ca-P) layer. The method has the advantage of being able to coat efficiently both compact materials and porous 3D architectures aimed at being used on tissue replacement applications and as bone tissue engineering scaffolds. This treatment is also very effective in reducing the incubation periods, being possible to observe the formation of an apatite-like layer, only after 6 h of immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The influence of the SBF concentration on the formation of the apatite coating was also studied. The apatite coatings formed under different conditions were analyzed and compared in terms of morphology, chemical composition and structure. After the first days of SBF immersion, the apatite-like films exhibit the typical cauliflower like morphology. With increasing immersion times, these films exhibited a partially amorphous nature and the Ca/P ratios became very closer to the value attributed to hydroxyapatite (1.67). The obtained results are very promising for pre-calcifying bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Therefore, in order to study cell behavior and response to these apatite coatings, adhesion, morphology, and proliferation of a human osteoblast cell line (SaOS-2) was also analyzed after being cultured in the coatings formed after 15 days of immersion in SBF. Results indicate a good correlation between crystallinity of the apatite like coatings formed in these conditions and respective cell spreading and morphology. In general, higher cell proliferation was observed for higher crystalline Ca-P coatings.

Although such cells are a central component of immune reactions and likely to be fundamental in determining the long-term clinical efficacy of implants, their response to biomaterials is not well known. This study has therefore examined the in vitro effects of phosphate-based glasses (PG), which can be produced with pre-determined solubility and may be promising materials for promoting the regeneration of new bone and other tissues. Extracts of PG which were modified by the addition of Ca, Co, Zn, and Fe oxides were found to cause only very low levels of activation of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes over a period of 6 days, as measured by changes in DNA synthesis. In contrast, the activation of these cells by concanavalin A, a potent T cell mitogen, was partially inhibited by extracts of a high-Ca PG and nearly totally ablated by the Co-derived extract. These studies show that, despite their apparent inability to activate immunologically responsive cells directly, substances which leach out of metal-containing PG implant materials have the potential to modulate inflammatory reactions.

In vitro studies in simulated body fluid (SBF) demonstrated rapid hydroxyapatite (HA) formation on the surface of the composites, indicating their bioactivity. For comparison, composite foams containing Bioglass particles as filler for the polymer matrix (in concentration of up to 40 wt %) were prepared by freeze-drying, enabling homogenous glass particle distribution in the polymer matrix. The formation of HA on the composite surfaces after immersion in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was investigated to confirm the bioactivity of the composites. Human osteoblasts (HOBs) were seeded onto as-fabricated PDLLA foams and onto PDLLA foams coated with Bioglass(R) particles to determine early cell attachment and spreading. Cells were observed to attach and spread on all surfaces after the first 90 min in culture. The results of this study indicate that the fabricated composite materials have potential as scaffolds for guided bone regeneration.

The purpose of the present study was to quantify the susceptibility artifacts produced by various biomaterials used for neurosurgical implants. Using a 3-tesla MR imaging unit, we obtained MR images of various biomaterials, including six types of ceramics, a cobalt-based alloy (Elgiloy), pure titanium, a titanium alloy, and stainless steel. All implants shared a uniform size and shape. In each image, a linear region of interest was defined across the center of the biomaterial in the transverse direction, and the diameter of the susceptibility artifact was calculated. The ceramics produced a considerably smaller artifact diameter than those produced by other biomaterials. Among the types of ceramics, zirconia was found to produce the smallest artifact diameter. Among the remaining biomaterials, the diameters of the artifacts decreased in order from that associated with stainless steel to those associated with cobalt-based alloys, pure titanium, and titanium alloy. Little difference was observed between the artifact diameters associated with pure titanium and titanium alloy. Ceramics are the most suitable biomaterials for minimizing artifacts in high-field MR imaging.","Iwate Med Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Morioka, Iwate 0208505, Japan; Iwate Med Univ, Dept Radiol, Morioka, Iwate 0208505, Japan","Inoue, T (reprint author), Iwate Med Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Uchimaru 19-1, Morioka, Iwate 0208505, Japan.",,,,,,,21,38,39,0,10,AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"UNIV VIRGINIA, 1224 WEST MAIN ST, STE 450, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA",0022-3085,,,J NEUROSURG,J.

A variant of the nondegradative modification of polyurethanes with epoxy groups attached to the urethane sites is proposed. Two types of commercial elastomeric segmented polyurethanes, represented by a poly(ether urethane) and a poly(urethane urea), were functionalized. by base-induced N-glycidylation of the urethane hard segments with an excess of epibromohydrin in dimethylacetamide solutions at low temperatures. This resulted in the modification of polymers with 0.30-0.44 mmol/g of pendant epoxy groups. Lithium or potassium tert-butoxides were used as bases to initiate the reaction. A nonpolymeric urethane model (ethyl N-p-tolylcarbamoate) was used to verify the course of glycidylation. One of the polymers was subjected to epoxy ring opening with 1-propanethiol, demonstrating the versatility of pendant glycidyl groups as auxiliary groups for further bulk modifications of polyurethanes. These functionalized polyurethanes are useful for the further covalent attachment of suitable moieties (stabilizing or biocompatibility-enhancing agents).

The etching procedure resulted in a complex gradient in pore size, porosity, and porous layer thickness, which was studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry and scanning electron microscopy. The gradients are of interest, e. g., for biomaterials research, biosensor applications, and for basic studies of adsorption of organic molecules, like proteins.

Material-related failures, however, such as lack of growth, thrombosis, and infection, do occur. Because a biodegradable scaffold can be replaced by the patient's own cells and will be treated as a foreign body for a limited period, we compared four biodegradable materials (gelatin, polyglycolic acid, (PGA), and copolymer made of epsilon-caprolactone and L-lactic acid reinforced with a poly-L-lactide knitted [KN-PCLA] or woven fabric [WV-PCLA]) with a nonbiodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material. An animal heart model was tested that simulates the in vivo clinical condition to which a synthetic material would be used. Methods: The five patches were used to repair transmural defects surgically created in the right ventricular outflow tracts of adult rat hearts (n = 5, each patch group). The PTFE patch group served as a control group. At 8 weeks after implantation, the biomaterials were excised. Patch size, patch thickness, infiltrated cell number, extracellular matrix composition, and patch degradation were evaluated. Results: The PTFE patch itself did not change in size except for increasing in thickness because of fibroblast and collagen coverage of both its surfaces. Host cells did not migrate into the PTFE biomaterial. In contrast, cells migrated into the biodegrading gelatin, PGA, and KN-PCLA and WV-PCLA scaffolds. Cellular ingrowth per unit patch area was highest in the KN-PCLA patch. The KN-PCLA patch increased modestly in size and thinness. The WV-PCNA patch did not change in size or thickness. Fibroblasts and collagen were the dominant cellular infiltrate and extracellular matrix formed in the biodegrading scaffolds. The in vivo rates of biomaterial degradation, thinning, and expansion were material specific. All the subendocardial patch surfaces were covered with endothelial cells. No thrombi were seen. Conclusions: The unique, spongy matrix structure of the PCLA patch favored cell colonization relative to the other patches. The strong, durable outer Poly-L-lactide fabric layers in these patches offered physical, biocompatible, and bioresorbable advantages relative to the other biodegradable materials studied. Host cells migrated into all the biomaterials. The cells secreted matrix and formed tissue, which was endothelialized on the endocardial surface. The biomaterial degradation rates and the tissue formation rates were material related. The PCLA grafts hold promise to become a suitable patch for surgical repair.","Toronto Gen Hosp, Toronto Gen Res Inst, Dept Surg, Div Cardiovasc Surg, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Li, RK (reprint author), Toronto Gen Hosp, Toronto Gen Res Inst, Dept Surg, Div Cardiovasc Surg, CCRW 1-815,200 Elizabeth St, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada.",,,"Li, Ren-Ke/0000-0002-2584-060X",,,,26,52,56,3,11,"MOSBY, INC",ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",0022-5223,,,J THORAC CARDIOV SUR,J.

The number of cycles to failure for the SUS-316L stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo cast alloy increased as the maximum stress decreased. The fatigue strengths of the SUS-316L stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo cast alloy at 1 x 108 cycles were much lower than those of the titanium alloys. The fatigue strengths of the vanadium-free Ti-6A1-7N6 and Ti-6Al-2Nb-1Ta alloys at 1 x 10(8) cycles were approximately 600 and 720 MPa, respectively. The fatigue strengths of the Ti-15Zr-4Nb-4Ta alloys annealed at 700 C for 2 h were about 700 MPa at 1 x 108 cycles, and were not significantly affected by varying the frequency from 2 to 10 Hz. Aging of the Ti-15Zr-4Nb-4Ta alloy containing 0.2%O and 0.05%N after solution treatment increased its ultimate tensile strength to 1150 MPa, and the total elongation and reduction in the area were 15 and 50%, respectively. The fatigue strength of the Ti-15Zr-4Ta-4Nb alloy treated in this way was 880 MPa under sine wave loading of 10 Hz at 1 x 108 cycles. This strength proved to be nearly identical to that estimated for the human hip joint, following an analysis of its movements and the forces acting upon it in vivo. The fatigue strength ratios at 1 x 108 cycles to ultimate tensile strength of the SUS-316L stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo cast alloy were about 50%. The fatigue strength ratio at 1 x 108 cycles to ultimate tensile strength of the Ti-6Al-2Nb-1Ta alloy was high at 75%. In the case of the Ti-15Zr-4Nb-4Ta alloy annealed or aged after solution treatment, the fatigue strength ratio to ultimate tensile strength was about 75%. Many striations and cracks caused by fatigue were visible on the fatigue-fractured surfaces of the SUS-316L stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo cast alloy. Micro-cracks in dimples were also apparent on the fatigue-fractured surface of the titanium alloys.","Natl Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Inst Mech Syst Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058564, Japan; Natl Inst Technol & Evaluat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan","Okazaki, Y (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Inst Mech Syst Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058564, Japan.",,"Okazaki, Yoshimitsu/M-8964-2018","Okazaki, Yoshimitsu/0000-0003-0354-564X",,,,10,12,13,1,9,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

Metallic implants have been utilized to aid in injury wound healing as bone replacements, endoprosthesis, and percutaneous devices. Of concern with metallic devices is the prolonged effects and service life of the implant. It is known that metallic dissolution and premature failure can occur in the body leading to complications for the host. In an effort to provide more corrosion resistant materials with adequate strength for better resistance against high cycle fatigue, Ti-Ta alloys are presented to compete with current, popular materials such as Ti6A14V. This research focuses on the binary alloy systems of Ti40Ta and Ti50Ta alloys for implant consideration. Three heat-treated versions of the Ti-Ta system that demonstrated high strength properties were also assessed. Cell culture testing of NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells was conducted to perform biocompatibility testing on these metal substrates. MTT cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate cellular behavior on the metal substrates. Flow cytometry assays were conducted to analyze rates of cell growth and cycling to determine best surface conditions among these metals. Results indicate very similar cellular activity on the Ti alloys and to a lesser degree on the commercially pure titanium and tantalum. Flow cytometry tests showed similar cellular growth rates on the different materials and on the control plastic. MTT assays indicate a higher degree of proliferation on the Ti-Ta alloys and on the Ti6A14V. Although the Ti and Ta elemental materials supported slightly fewer cells on their surface, differences were minimal. Ti-Ta alloys appear to be comparable if not slightly more compatible than the standard Ti6A14V.","Univ Texas, Dept Met & Mat Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Biol Sci, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Villa, R (reprint author), Univ Texas, Dept Met & Mat Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",,,"Murr, Lawrence/0000-0001-5942-8376",,,,11,9,10,0,14,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

Effects of laser conditions such as laser power input or pulse duration were investigated on the microstructure and tensile strength of spot melted wires. Width of the melted metal decreased by laser irradiation with a shorter pulse duration and was about 0.3 mm for the 0.35 mm diameter wires. On the contrary, laser spot melting with a shorter pulse duration needed more precise control of laser conditions to achieve the sound melting free from burn out of the samples. Similarly, melting of thinner wire needed more precise control of laser conditions. Melted metal exhibited a rapidly quenched austenite cell microstructure with a cell size of less than about 5 mum. Tensile strength of the spot melted wires was 660 MPa, which was almost the same as that of annealed base materials. Besides, corrosion resistance in a quasi biological environment was hardly degraded by spot melting.

Conventional austenitic stainless steel, 316L, was also polarized for comparison. The both alloys were spontaneously passivated in all electrolytes. The HNS didn't show pitting corrosion in the polarization range in all electrolytes although the 316L showed pitting corrosion. Passive current densities of the HNS in all electrolytes were lower than those of 316L. Therefore, the HNS shows higher passivity and resistance to pitting corrosion than 316L. The passive current density in Hanks of HNS was lower than that in saline, indicating that the protectiveness of surface oxide film increased with the existence of inorganic ions such as phosphate and calcium ions. On the other hand, the passive current density in E-MEM was higher than that in Hanks, but was lower than that in saline. Consequently, the HNS must show high corrosion resistance in vivo and be a promising biomaterials.","Natl Inst Mat Sci, Biomat Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan; Natl Inst Mat Sci, Steel Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Kuroda, D (reprint author), Natl Inst Mat Sci, Biomat Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011",,,,,23,37,39,0,6,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

Change in this function when contacting fibroblasts with various polymer microspheres was estimated using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay system. When the cells were in contact on test dishes, the inhibition level increased as the diameters of polystyrene microspheres decreased, except for a microsphere with 0.5 mum diameter. The function was inclined to be recovered with the increase of the incubation time, while it was not recovered when the cells were cultured with pre-coated polystyrene microspheres. As well as inhibitory activities of the function, cytotoxicity potentials of tested microspheres depended on their diameter and their composition. These findings suggest that the size and the physico-chemical character of polymer microspheres, and how cells recognize them plays important roles in causing influences of the microspheres on both gap junctional intercellular communication and their cytotoxicity. Therefore, estimating the inhibitory effect of biomaterials on the gap junctional intercellular communication will provide valuable information about the biocompatibility of materials even in the form of particles.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Nakaoka, R (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",nakaoka@nihs.go.jp,,,,,,31,4,4,0,6,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

The proliferation and differentiation of NHOst cells cultured on 10Au-62Ag-13Pd were significantly decreased more than those on 13Au-58Ag-21Pd, respectively. It was suggested that the content of Cu caused the difference in the proliferation and differentiation between NHOst cells cultured on 13Au-58Ag-21Pd and that on 10Au-62Ag-13Pd. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the Au-Ag-Pd alloy was evaluated by the MEM elution assay and the colony assay using fibroblast L929 and V79 cells, in order to compare with the cytological effects of the alloy on NHOst cells. 13Au-58Ag-21Pd showed no cytotoxicity to L929 and V79 cells in the MEM elution assay and the colony assay. However, 10Au-62Ag-13Pd showed extremely weak cytotoxicity to L929 cells and weak cytotoxicity to V79 cells in the colony assay, though 10Au-62Ag-13Pd showed no cytotoxicity to L929 cells in the MEM elution assay. NHOst cells expressed the toxicity to the proliferation and differentiation on 10Au-62Ag-13Pd clearly. The in vitro toxicity test based on the proliferation and differentiation of NHOst cells was useful to evaluate the toxicity of medical materials.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Isama, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,14,6,6,0,5,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

However, restenosis remains one of the most crucial problems in interventional cardiology. Inflammatory infiltrates and foreign body reactions can be found in the tissue surrounding the struts in stenting. Thrombogenesis, proliferation of a-actin expressing cells (smooth muscle cells) and hyperplasia of the intima occur. In order to improve the biocompatibility of the stents, new stent designs and stent coatings have been developed. One advantage of stent coating is the combination of mechanical stability of the stent with the biocompatibility of the coating. The coatings are divided into active and passive coatings. Passive coatings improve the biocompatibility of the stent, while active coatings may suppress neointima proliferation by releasing anti-inflammatory or antiproliferative substances. Immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus, sirolimus) and cytostatic drugs (paclitaxel) have been tested in several studies and showed promising results. However, it could also be demonstrated that polymer-coated stents used as a matrix for drug release reduced the hyperplasia of the intima. However, after dissipation of the immunosuppressants or cytostatics, the presence of the polymer itself lead to a delayed inflammation and proliferation causing restenosis. Thus, efforts have been made to develop inorganic coatings that are suitable for drug loading. One promising approach is a new nanoporous alumina coating. Preliminary tests with this coating revealed favourable loading characteristics and sustained drug release in vivo. The present article provides an overview on different approaches for stent coatings.","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Cardiol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Chem, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Pathol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Surg, D-45122 Essen, Germany; AlCove Surfaces GMBH, Gladbeck, Germany; JOMED GMBH, Rangendingen, Germany","Karoussos, IA (reprint author), Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Dept Cardiol, Hufelandstr 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,84,12,12,0,2,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Since its discovery interest increases in the biological as well as in medical aspects of this genetic program. On the one hand, missing or low induction of apoptosis is connected to an increased cancer risk, on the other hand, an excessive occurrence of cell death results in serious consequences for the whole organism. An early death of immune competent cells may weaken the immune defense. Additionally, the acceptance of transplanted organs or synthetic prostheses is decreased when surrounding tissues are induced to undergo apoptosis. Particularly metallic ingredients or impurities in alloys or plastic materials may interfere with cellular signal transduction pathways that induce apoptosis leading to detrimental effects. The review summarises recent publications on apoptosis induced by metals and metal compounds with the aim of providing a better understanding of the connection between the apoptotic machinery and the toxic effects of metals in medicine.","Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Toxicol & Genet, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany","Krug, HF (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Toxicol & Genet, ITG POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",,,,,,,55,6,6,0,2,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

The scale of research has changed over recent years, passing from a macroscopic view to a microscopic view, resulting in a change from mechanical devices, such as prostheses, catheters and slings to the cellular unit and more particularly in vitro cell cultures. New techniques, such as gene therapy and cell reconstruction have been recently introduced into the field of urology. Prospective biocompatibility studies must be conducted to establish appropriate biocompatibility standards adapted to new materials. The development of these new materials required a multidisciplinary approach involving engineers, biologists and physicists. It must be conducted in specialized centres skilled in biocompatibility research and in close collaboration with a basic bioscience and clinical practice. In the future, synthetic biomaterials will have an almost unlimited range of mechanical properties allowing much more specific applications. Another improvement of materials will concern a reduction of the risk of infection, erosion, mineral deposits, migration of particles, secondary reactions, and finally improved durability. However the long-term properties of synthetic materials will probably not be as good as those of natural or almost natural biomaterials derived from biotechnology by tissue engineering.","Hop Charles Nicolle, Serv Urol, Rouen, France","Grise, P (reprint author), CHU Charles Nicolle, Serv Urol, Rue Germont, F-76031 Rouen, France.",,,,,,,24,7,7,0,3,PROGRES EN UROLOGIE,PARIS,"76 RUE DE LA POMPE, 75016 PARIS, FRANCE",1166-7087,,,PROG UROL,Prog.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the most important ligand for cell activity. ECM is known to contain collagen, one of whose constituents is gelatin. Although natural gelatin has good cell attachment properties, the melting point of gelatin hydrogel is lower than body temperature. Thus, non-chemically cross-linked gelatin hydrogel is not a biomaterial that is used for prostheses. In the present study, we report the preparation of acyl-gelatin hydrogels with high melting point (>37degreesC) and high affinity for hydrophobic surfaces for easy handling for transportation and adhesion activities on the hydrophobic surfaces. In addition, the doubling time of endothelial cells on the coated cell culture plate was faster than that of natural gelatin owing to the higher adhesion activity of acyl-gelatin. The results clearly demonstrated that the acyl-gelatin acted as an interface that enabled cell adhesion to artificial materials surfaces.","Mie Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Mat, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan",,,,,,,,12,1,1,3,6,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,HILVERSUM,"PO BOX 1673, 1200 BR HILVERSUM, NETHERLANDS",0929-8665,,,PROTEIN PEPTIDE LETT,Protein Pept.

Nanometric topography production has traditionally relied on expensive and time-consuming techniques such as electron beam lithography. This presents disadvantages to the cell biologist in regard to material availability. New research is focusing on less expensive methods of nanotopography production for in vitro cell engineering. One such method is the spontaneous demixing of polymers (in this case polystyrene and polybromostyrene) to produce nanometrically high islands. This article observes fibroblast response to nanometric islands (13, 35, and 95 nn in height) produced by polymer demixing. Changes in cell morphology, cytoskeleton, and proliferation are observed by light, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. Morphological features produced by cells in response to the materials were selected, and cell shape parameters were measured with shape-recognition software. The results showed that island height could either increase or reduce cell spreading and proliferation in relation to control, with 13-nn islands producing cells with the greatest area and 95 nn islands producing cells with the lowest areas. Interaction of filopodia with the islands could been seen to increase as island size was increased.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Ctr Cell Engn, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Pure & Appl Chem, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Dalby, MJ (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Ctr Cell Engn, Joseph Black Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,"Dalby, Matthew/G-2426-2012; Riehle, Mathis/A-3427-2011","Riehle, Mathis/0000-0001-7988-1514; Dalby, Matthew/0000-0002-0528-3359",,,,38,192,198,1,30,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,DEC,2002.0,8,6,,,,,1099,1108,,10.1089/107632702320934191,,,,10,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,621EW,WOS:000179576400020,12542955.0,,,,2019-02-25

Next to conventional techniques, open and laparoscopic tension-free methods using mesh implants to reinforce the abdominal wall are increasingly carried out, even becoming the standard procedure in many countries. Because of the benefits of material-reduced meshes for incisional hernia repair, a new mesh modification for tension-free inguinal hernia repair has been developed. In the present study this new low-weight mesh (Vypro II) made of polypropylene and polyglactin multifilaments was compared to a common heavy-weight polypropylene mesh (Prolene) regarding their functional consequences and the morphologic tissue response. After implantation in rats as an inlay, abdominal wall mobility was recorded by three-dimensional photogrammetry and the tensile strength of the suture zone and the mesh itself was measured at 3, 21, and 90 days. Explanted tissue samples have been investigated for their histologic reaction in regard to the inflammatory infiltrate, vascularization, and connective and fat tissue ingrowth. Numbers of granulocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and foreign giant body cells have been evaluated to reflect the quality of the tissue response. The cellular response was assessed by measuring DNA strand breaks and apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67), and cell stress (HSP70). The results indicated that restriction of abdominal wall mobility was significantly reduced with Vypro II compared to that seen with heavy-weight mesh modification, and the inflammatory reaction and connective tissue formation were markedly diminished. Apoptosis and cell proliferation showed considerably lowered levels, and expression of cytoprotective HSP70 was significantly increased. The present study thus confirms the benefits of material-reduced mesh modifications. The new low-weight mesh (Vypro II) could be advantageous in inguinal hernia repair.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Pathol, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, German Ctr Excellence Biomaterial & Implant Patho, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Surg, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Klosterhalfen, B (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Pathol, Pauwelstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,39,102,121,0,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0364-2313,,,WORLD J SURG,World J.Surg.,DEC,2002.0,26,12,,,,,1472,1480,,10.1007/s00268-002-6444-z,,,,9,Surgery,Surgery,626HH,WOS:000179865400014,12297937.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Cationic poly-L-lysine . HBr (PLL) was reinforced by sodium montmorillonite clay. The PLL/clay nanocomposites were made via the solution-intercalation film-casting technique. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy data indicated that montmorillonite layers intercalated with PLL chains coexist with exfoliated layers over a wide range of relative PLL/clay compositions. Differential scanning calorimetry suggests that the presence of clay suppresses crystal formation in PLL relative to the neat polypeptide and slightly decreases the PLL melting temperature. Despite lower crystallinity, dynamic mechanical analysis revealed a significant increase in the storage modulus of PLL with an increase in clay loading producing storage modulus magnitudes on par with traditional engineering thermoplastics.

Through a small midline laparotomy a 2 x 2-cm piece of mesh (n = 80) was sewn to an intact peritoneum on each side of a midline incision in 40 New Zealand White rabbits. Two types of ePTFE mesh [Dual Mesh (Dual) and modified Dual Mesh (C-Type), W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ] and PP mesh (Marlex, C.R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ) were compared. In 10 rabbits (n = 20) a laparoscopic adhesiolysis (LapA) was performed at one week. Mesh adhesions were scored using a modified Diamond scale (0, 0%; 1, 1-25%; 2, 26-50%; and 3, >50%) at 1, 3, 9, and 16 weeks by serial microlaparoscopic (2 mm) examinations. After recording the final adhesion score at 16 weeks the prosthetic biomaterials were excised en bloc with the anterior abdominal wall for histologic evaluation of mesothelial layer growth (%) on the visceral surface of the mesh. Statistical differences (P value <0.05) were measured by chi-square and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. There were no statistical differences in mean adhesion scores at adhesiolysis at 7 days. The mean adhesion scores in the groups undergoing laparoscopic adhesiolysis was statistically less (P < 0.05) for PP and both ePTFE meshes at 3-, 9-, and 16-week intervals compared with those not undergoing adhesiolysis. The percentage of mesothelialization on the visceral surface of the mesh was not statistically different between the adhesiolysis and control groups for any of the prosthetic biomaterials. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis at one week minimizes subsequent adhesion formation to PP and ePTFE mesh over a 4-month follow-up. Adhesion formation within the first 7 days after mesh implantation appears to determine the long-term adhesion score. Eliminating adhesions to mesh by mechanical or other means during this critical time may control adhesions to the mesh and subsequent mesh-related complications.","Carolinas Med Ctr, Dept Gen Surg, Charlotte, NC 28203 USA; Carolinas Med Ctr, James B Cannon Res Ctr, Charlotte, NC 28203 USA","Matthews, BD (reprint author), Carolinas Med Ctr, Dept Gen Surg, 1000 Blythe Blvd,MEB 601, Charlotte, NC 28203 USA.",,,,,,,38,12,15,0,1,SOUTHEASTERN SURGICAL CONGRESS,CUMMING,"115 SAMARITAN DR, #200, CUMMING, GA 30040-2354 USA",0003-1348,1555-9823,,AM SURGEON,Am.

Caspofungin displayed potent in vitro activity against sessile C. albicans cells within biofilms, with MICs at which 50% of the sessile cells were inhibited well within the drug's therapeutic range. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to visualize the effects of caspofungin on preformed C. albicans biofilms, and the results indicated that caspofungin affected the cellular morphology and the metabolic status of cells within the biofilms. The coating of biomaterials with caspofungin had an inhibitory effect on subsequent biofilm development by C. albicans.

Analysis of surface bound complement proteins revealed significantly reduced binding of activated C3 and C5b-9 to HBS in vitro, compared with uncoated surfaces, which was probably due to more HBS bound complement inhibitors (C1-Inhibitor, factor H) being present. This was reflected by significantly reduced activation of the alternative pathway (C3bBbP) and terminal complex (SC5b-9) by HBS but slightly increased levels of classic pathway complex (C1rs-C1-inhibitor). These results were confirmed during in vivo study by analysis of hemolytic complement function, activation specific C3 derived split products, and surface bound complement proteins. Increased binding of complement regulators to HBS appears to effectively reduce complement activation by biomaterials, leading to improved long-term biocompatibility.","Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Physiol, ECC Lab, Inst Physiol, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Univ Heidelberg, Inst Immunol, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany","Kopp, R (reprint author), Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Physiol, ECC Lab, Inst Physiol, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,38,30,30,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,NOV-DEC,2002.0,48,6,,,,,598,605,,10.1097/01.MAT.0000033639.23941.7E,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,615QV,WOS:000179258800005,12455769.0,,,,2019-02-25

First, dithiobis(propanoic dihydrazide) (DTP) and dithiobis(butyric dihydrazide) (DTB) were synthesized and then coupled to HA with carbodiimide chemistry. Next, disulfide bonds of the initially formed gel were reduced using dithiothreitol (DTT) to give, after exhaustive dialysis, the corresponding thiol-modified macromolecular derivatives HA-DTPH and HA-DTBH. The degree of substitution of HA-DTPH and HA-DTBH could be controlled from 20% to 70% of available glucuronate carboxylic acid groups. The pK(a) values of the HA-thiol derivatives were determined spectrophotometrically to be pK(a) = 8.87 (HADTPH) and pK(a) = 9.01 (HA-DTBH). The thiol groups could be oxidized in air to reform disulfide linkages, which resulted in HA-DTPH and HA-DTBH hydrogel films. Further oxidation of these hydrogels with dilute H(2)O(2) created additional cross-links and afforded poorly swellable films. The disulfide cross-linking was reversible, and films could be again reduced to sols with DTT. Release of blue dextran from crosslinked films was used as a model for drug release. The rapid gelation of the HA-DTPH solution under physiological conditions was also achieved, which demonstrated the capacity for in situ cell encapsulation. Thus, L-929 murine fibroblasts were encapsulated in HA-DTPH hydrogel; these cells remained viable and proliferated during 3 days of culture in vitro.","Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Prestwich, GD (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, 419 Wakara Way,Suite 205, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA.",gprestwich@pharm.utah.edu,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [DC04663],,,55,379,385,10,277,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,NOV-DEC,2002.0,3,6,,,,,1304,1311,,10.1021/bm025603c,,,,8,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,615GB,WOS:000179236500022,12425669.0,,,,2019-02-25

The following materials were implanted subcutaneously for 7 weeks then excised for histologic analysis: a solid PU; a solid polyurethane with silicone and polyethylene oxide (PU-S-PEO); porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE); and porous polyvinyl alcohol sponge (PVA). Two thicknesses of PU-S-PEO were compared: 300 pin (thin) and 2000 put (thick). Foreign body capsule (FBC) thickness was much less in PU-S-PEO implants than in PU implants. In addition, FBC were thinner in thin implants than in thick implants. FBC was much more dense in solid implants than in porous implants. As compared with solid implants, porous implants (PVA and ePTFE) led to a marked increase in the number of microvessels that developed adjacent to the implant, as observed both with hematoxylin/eosin staining and with an immunohistochemical anti-endothelial stain. We conclude that the polyethylene oxide and silicone moieties in PU reduce the thickness of the Subsequent FBC. In addition, thin implants lead to a thin FBC.

In addition, hydrogels, three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that are able to swell large amounts of water, can be made to resemble the physical characteristics of soft tissues. Hydrogel materials also generally exhibit high permeability and good biocompatibility making, these materials attractive for use in cell encapsulation and tissue engineering applications. A number of hydrogel materials can be formed via photopolymerization processes mild enough to be carried out in the presence of living cells. This allows one to homogeneously seed cells throughout the scaffold material and to form hydrogels in situ. This review presents advantages of photopolymerization of hydrogels and describes the photoinitiators and materials in current use. Applications of photopolymerized hydrogels in tissue engineering that have been investigated are summarized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Non-adhesive hydrogels were modified with adhesive Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide sequences to facilitate the adhesion, spreading, and, consequently, cytoskeletal organization of rat calvarial osteoblasts. When attached to hydrogel surfaces, the density and area of osteoblasts attached were dramatically different between modified and unmodified hydrogels. A concentration dependence of RGD groups was observed, with increased osteoblast attachment and spreading with higher RGD concentrations, and cytoskeleton organization was seen with only the highest peptide density. A majority of the osteoblasts survived the photoencapsulation process when gels were formed with 10% macromer, but a decrease in osteoblast viability of similar to25% and 38% was seen after I day of in vitro culture when the macromer concentration was increased to 20 and 30wt%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in cell viability when peptides were added to the network. Finally, mineral deposits were seen in all hydrogels after 4 weeks of in vitro culture, but a significant increase in mineralization was observed upon introduction of adhesive peptides throughout the network.

To this end, poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), a viscous polyester synthesized from diethyl fumarate (DEF), has been studied for use as an engineered bone graft. We have investigated the photocrosslinking of PPF dissolved in its precursor, DEF, using the photoinitiator bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) and low levels of ultraviolet light exposure. A three factor, 2 x 2 x 4 factorial design was developed, studying the effects of PPF number average molecular weight, BAPO initiator content, and DEF content upon photocrosslinking characteristics and mechanical properties. Uncured DEF/PPF solution viscosity fell over three orders of magnitude as DEF content was increased from 0% to 75%. The exothermic photocrosslinking reaction released low levels of heat, with no more than 160 J/g released from any formulation tested. As a result, the maximum photocrosslinking temperature remained below 47degreesC for all samples. Both sol fraction and swelling degree generally increased with increasing DEF content. Compressive mechanical properties were within the range of trabecular bone, with the strongest samples possessing an elastic modulus of 195.3 +/- 17.5 MPa and a fracture strength of 68.8 +/- 9.4 MPa. Finally, the results indicate that PPF crosslinking was facilitated at low DEF precursor concentrations, but hindered at higher precursor concentrations. These novel DEF/PPF solutions may be preferred over pure PPF as the basis for an engineered bone graft because they (1) exhibit reduced viscosity and thus are easily handled, (2) form polymer networks with compressive strength at fracture suitable for consideration for trabecular bone replacement, and (3) may be readily fabricated into solids with a wide range of structures.

Cells were encapsulated in uncrosslinked gelatin microparticles of average diameter of 630 mum containing similar to53 cells. Gelatin microparticles were crosslinked to shell thicknesses of similar to75 pin via exposure to I mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) solution for 15 min or 5 mm DSP solution for 5 min for the production of microparticles dispersing similar to60 min after placement into a physiologic fluid at 37degreesC. Formed microparticles were placed into culture wells at a cell seeding density of 5.3 x 10(4) cell/cm(2) and, following the degradation and/or dissolution of gelatin, the cells were cultured in the presence of osteogenic supplements for 28 days. Samples were taken at specified time points and analyzed by a DNA assay for cell number and a H-3-thymidine incorporation assay for proliferative potential. Samples were also obtained and analyzed at several time points by alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and mineralization assays for early and late phenotypic expression markers of osteoblastic differentiation. The measurements from the different assays for encapsulated cells (EC) in uncrosslinked and crosslinked gelatin microparticles were normalized with the cell numbers from the DNA assay and compared with those for nonencapsulated control cells. The results demonstrated that the marrow stromal cells survived the encapsulation procedure in uncrosslinked gelatin microparticles and also retained their proliferative potential and osteoblastic phenotype over a 28 day period, although at a slightly lower level than the nonencapsulated cells. The results further showed that the marrow stromal cells survived the encapsulation in crosslinked gelatin microparticles prepared via exposure to 5 mm DSP for 5 min and also retained their proliferative potential and osteoblastic phenotype over a 28 day period, but at a slightly lower level than the EC in uncrosslinked gelatin microparticles. In contrast, exposure to 1 mm DSP for 15 min led to severely limited cell viability and phenotypic expression probably due to the increased crosslinking time. These results suggest that temporary encapsulation of cells in gelatin microparticles may protect cells from short-term environmental effects such as those associated with the crosslinking of an injectable polymeric carrier for bone tissue engineering.

This may be explained, in part, by our recent reports of apoptosis of biomaterial-adherent leukocytes induced through exposure to shear stress. Here we utilize a rotating disk system to generate physiologically relevant shear stress levels (0-18 dynes / cm(2)) at the surface of a polyetherurethane urea (PEUU) and investigate neutrophil intracellular pathways involved in shear-induced apoptosis. In situ detection of activated caspases, the enzymatic mediators of the apoptosis cascade, showed qualitatively that these proteases participate in shear-induced apoptosis and are activated in a shear-dependent manner. The involvement of caspase 3 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of extracted neutrophil proteins. Comparative studies with neutrophils adherent under static conditions demonstrated time-dependent activation of caspases in TNF-alpha/cycloheximide-induced apoptosis, for which caspase-3 also was implicated. These findings are the first steps toward elucidation of the mechanisms behind the inappropriate induction of apoptosis by adhesion to biomaterials, which may contribute to the development and persistence of device-related infections.

Three 5-mm cylinders were placed end-to-end to fill a 15-mm defect created in the humeri of adult rabbits and were stabilized by an intramedullary rod. In controls, the titanium fiber-mesh cylinders were combined with PLA-PEG in the absence of BMP. Six weeks after implantation, new bone had formed on the surface of the implant and had bridged the defect. All of the defects (5/5) treated by cylinders containing 120 mug (40 mug x 3) of BMP were repaired completely. New bone formation was also found inside the pores of the cylinders. The defect was not repaired in the control animals. These results demonstrate that these new composite implants fabricated by combining rhBMP, synthetic degradable polymers and compatible biomaterials enhance the regeneration potential of bone. Thus, it is possible that large skeletal defects can be repaired using this prosthesis in lieu of autogenous bone graft.

The effect of these chronic exposures on the ability of cells to respond to a subsequent challenge is not known. To investigate this idea, we exposed human THP-1 monocytes to sublethal concentrations of HEMA, TEGDMA, Hg2+, and Ni2+ for 2 weeks and then assessed the monocytic response to subsequent 24-h challenge with the same components at higher concentrations. Chronic (2 week) exposures of monocytes to HEMA and both metal ions significantly altered monocyte response to short-term (24 h) secondary exposures, even when overt effects of the chronic exposures were not apparent. However, cellular responses were highly variable depending on the material and its concentrations. For TEGDMA, no effects were seen. These results demonstrate that the chronic effects of materials must be considered even when the chronic exposure has no initial overt effect. The effect on cells may only be apparent if the cell is challenged by a secondary exposure.

Preliminary results of their potential in the field of controlled-release technologies also have been reported.

Two different methodologies of synthesis, namely, in solution and in emulsion, have been tested. The structure of the copolymers was studied by H-1-NMR and infrared spectroscopy and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cytotoxicity tests were conducted to assess their biocompatibility. The copolymers were used to prepare particles by the emulsion-solvent evaporation technique. The shapes and dimensions of the particles were dependent on the polymer type and concentration used. The surfaces of the particles were modified by the presence of polyacrylamide residues, as demonstrated by zeta-potential measurements. The release behavior of the particles was assessed by encapsulating rhodamine B as the model compound. The release was faster for the particles prepared by the grafted polymer as a consequence of its increased hydrophilicity. Based on these novel biomaterials, preliminary results suggest a potential of the particles for peroral or parenteral drug delivery.

The results show very different protein adsorption properties for different SMEs on the same backbone polymer. Fibrinogen binds weakly on the hydrophilic backbone of a poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS)-modified polyurethane surface but leaves the hydrophobic PDMS part untouched. On sulfonate end-group-modified (SO3-) polyurethane surfaces, fibrinogen adsorbs well. However, on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-modified surfaces, it adsorbs poorly. The protein-resistant character of PEO is probably due to steric repulsion. This work demonstrates the utility of SFG in the study of protein adsorption on polymeric biomaterials at the molecular level and the ability of SMEs to mediate protein adsorption.

This article describes a new approach for testing biomaterials in vivo using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the developing chicken embryo, as an alternative to the traditional mammalian models. Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated for 4 days, at which time a small window was cut in the shell of the egg. After 1 week of incubation, the CAM received several test materials, including the endotoxin LPS, a cotton thread and a Silastic tubing. One day and 1 week later, the tissue response to the test materials was assessed using gross, histological, and scanning electron microscope evaluations. The inflammatory response of the chorioallantoic membrane to biomaterials was fully characterized and found to be similar to that of the mammalian response and was also seen to vary according to test materials. We also found that the structure and geometry of the test materials greatly influenced the incorporation of the samples in the CAM. The similarity of the tissue response of the CAM with the mammalian models, plus the low cost, simplicity, and possibility to continuously visualize the test site through the shell window make this animal model particularly attractive for the rapid in vivo screening of biomaterials.

The properties of the PDLLA-modified surfaces and the controls were investigated by water contact angle measurement and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). These data reflect the change in the biocompatibility of modified PDLLA surfaces. Then rat osteoblasts were seeded onto these modified surfaces and on controls to examine their effects on cell adhesion and proliferation. Cell morphologies on these surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cell viability was evaluated with a MTT assay. In addition, differentiated cell function was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity.

XPS investigations have shown that low-temperature vacuum annealing can create a controlled number of Ti3+ defects (up to 21% Ti3+/Ti4+ at 573 K).

Integrity of the osseous tissue requires the contribution of mesenchymal stem cells and their continuous differentiation into an osteoblastic phenotype. This study aims to investigate the hypothesis that exposure to wear debris particles derived from orthopaedic biomaterials affects the osteoblastic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Upon in vitro culture in the presence of osteogenic supplements (OS), we observe that cultures of hMSCs isolated from femoral head bone marrow are capable of osteogenic differentiation, expressing alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein (BSP), in addition to producing collagen type I and BSP accompanied by extracellular matrix mineralization. Exposure of OS-treated hMSCs to submicron commercially pure titanium (cpTi) particles suppresses BSP gene expression, reduces collagen type I and BSP production, decreases cellular proliferation and viability, and inhibits matrix mineralization. In comparison, exposure to zirconium oxide (ZrO2) particles of similar size did not alter osteoblastic gene expression and resulted in only a moderate decrease in cellular proliferation and mineralization. Confocal imaging of cpTi-treated hMSC cultures revealed patchy groups of cells displaying disorganized cytoskeletal architecture and low levels of extracellular BSP. These in vitro findings suggest that chronic exposure of marrow cells to titanium wear debris in vivo may contribute to decreased bone formation at the bone/implant interface by reducing the population of viable hMSCs and compromising their differentiation into functional osteoblasts. Understanding the nature of hMSC bioreactivity to orthopaedic wear debris should provide additional insights into mechanisms underlying aseptic loosening.

We describe here a new method for the neovascularization of polyurethane meshes from explants of rat aorta. Aortic rings embedded in collagen-permeated polyurethane meshes and cultured in medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and vascular endothelial growth factor generated florid microvascular outgrowths that efficiently vascularized the available spaces between polyurethane fibers. The neovessels could be identified in the live cultures by phase-contrast microscopy, and in formalin-fixed preparations by the ABC peroxidase procedure, using the endothelial-specific Grifforlia isolectin B4. The aortic outgrowths were successfully labeled with the intravital fluorescent dyes Calcein AM or SPDiOC(18), which are notoxic and can be used for tracking studies. This study shows that artificial biomaterial meshes can be colonized ex vivo with histotypic microvascular networks, and provides the proof of concept for the future development of stably vascularized devices for in vivo implantation.

The coated specimens were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metallography and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The coatings of different thicknesses were evaluated for corrosion resistance by various electrochemical techniques in deaerated Hank's solution of pH 7.4 at 37 degreesC, which simulates body fluid conditions. The results revealed that among four different thicknesses of alumina, the 150-mum-thick alumina coating provides good protection and increases the breakdown potential. While all thicknesses of MSZ coating provides very good protection, breakdown potential increases considerably for the 150-mum-thick coating. The breakdown potential increases marginally for the 50-mum-thick YSZ coating. Among the three types of coatings, the MSZ coating has been identified as a suitable coating material and its optimum thickness is 150 mum as it increases the breakdown to a maximum value. Therefore, the present results show that the plasma-sprayed MSZ ceramic coating of 150 mum helps in improving the corrosion resistance of 316 L stainless steel considerably.

The PPY film was first graft copolymerized with 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) and subsequently silanized with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (ATS) via Si-O bonding with the hydroxyl groups of the grafted HEA polymer. Water-soluble carbodiimide-activated hyaluronic acid was then covalently immobilized through amide linkage formation with the primary amine groups introduced on the PPY film surface via the ATS silanization process. The amount of HA immobilized could be varied by changing the concentration of the primary amine groups on the PPY film surface. The immobilized HA was biologically active as evaluated by using a protein binding assay, and it retained a significant degree of its activity after 4 days storage in air. The present method of covalent immobilization of HA on PPY film surface offers the advantages of preserving the film's electrical conductivity and mechanical strength and at the same time improving the film's surface wettability.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore","Neoh, KG (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Kent Ridge, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",chenkg@nus.edu.sg,"Kang, En-Tang/G-8522-2012","Kang, En-Tang/0000-0003-0599-7834; Neoh, Koon Gee/0000-0002-2700-1914",,,,34,37,38,0,19,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,OCT 29,2002.0,18,22,,,,,8633,8640,,10.1021/la025979b,,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,608HC,WOS:000178839300053,,,,,2019-02-25

In aqueous media, the hydrophobic end-standing polymerizable methacrylic units of the macromonomers self-organize, and their polymerization leads to networks with better mechanical properties than those prepared with the same macromonomers but in organic solvents.

One of the major problems in the application of these materials is their relatively poor mechanical strength, attributed to the high degree of hydration of the gel. This work was directed to the study of the interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilized fibers, with the objective of optimization of the mechanical properties of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) membranes. The membranes were prepared by electron-beam irradiation of an aqueous polymer solution. A nonwoven cloth made of polypropylene matted fiber, grafted with methyl methacrylate, was employed as a reinforcement. The changes in the main properties of the membranes, such as the gel content, swelling characteristics, cytotoxicity, and mechanical behavior, were investigated. The results showed an increase of 800% in tensile strength, without changes in the swelling and cytotoxicity.

Microcombustion calorimetric studies of a polyglycolide sample with the empirical formula C2.000H2.160O2.032Cl0.009243Na0.004404 (PGA) led to Delta(f)H(m)(o)(PGA, pol) = -(379.1 +/- 1.1) kJ.mol(-1). These results were used to discuss the energetics of the solid-state polymerization of alkali metal halogenoacetates leading to polyglycolide. In agreement with experimental observations, it is concluded that for a given metal, the reaction becomes less favorable when the halogen changes along the series Cl --> Br --> I. The reaction is also considerably less favorable for the lithium than for the homologue sodium salts. These differences in reactivity seem to be mainly determined by the lattice enthalpy of the alkali metal halide salt formed in each reaction.","Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Quim Estrutural, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Chem, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","da Piedade, MEM (reprint author), Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Quim Estrutural, Complexo Interdisciplinar, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",pememp@popsrv.ist.utl.pt; matthias.epple@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,"Minas da Piedade, Manuel/E-9960-2017; Diogo, Herminio/H-8246-2012; Piedade, Manuel/A-4262-2013","Minas da Piedade, Manuel/0000-0001-7550-6952; Diogo, Herminio/0000-0002-0808-1306; Piedade, Manuel/0000-0001-7550-6952",,,,55,5,5,1,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

They can be prepared easily from available, low cost resources and can be manipulated to meet desirable characteristics. Polyanhydrides are biocompatible and degrade in vivo into non-toxic diacid counterparts that are eliminated from the body as metabolites. Owing to their usefulness, this review focuses on the development, synthesis methods, structures and characterization of polyanhydrides, which will provide an overview for the researchers in the field. Their in vitro and in vivo degradability, toxicity, biocompatibility and applications are discussed in the subsequent chapters of this special issue on polyanhydrides and poly(ortho esters).

Their hydrolysis is investigated at pH 2.0 in HCl and DL-lactic acid (DLLA) solutions (37degreesC) for up to 300 days, and the results are compared with those obtained for Pi-LA films hydrolyzed at pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered solution) and pH 12 (NaOH solution). The changes in the weight loss and molecular weight distribution of the PLLA films during hydrolysis in the acid media reveals that their hydrolysis proceeds homogeneously along the film cross section by mainly a bulk erosion mechanism. Moreover, the durability of PLLA films in the acid media is very similar to that in the neutral medium but higher than that in the alkaline medium. The hydrolysis rate constant values (k) of the initially amorphous PLLA0 film evaluated from the changes in the number-average molecular weight were 3.0 and 2.4 x 10(-3) day(-1) at pH 2.0 in the HCl and DLLA solutions, respectively, These k values are very similar to 2.6 x 10(-3) day(-1) at pH 7.4 in the phosphate-buffered solution. The similar k values and the negligible weight loss after the hydrolysis for 300 days reflect that the hydronium ions and the lactic acid oligomers and monomers have insignificant catalytic effects on the hydrolysis of the PLLA films. Increasing the initial crystallinity of the PLLA film increases the hydrolysis rate in the HCl solution, whereas increasing the initial crystallinity of the PLLA film does not alter the hydrolysis rate in the DLLA solution. The differential scanning calorimetry results show that the crystallization of PLLA chains occurs during the hydrolysis, irrespective of the hydrolysis acid media and the initial crystallinity.

Of interest in our laboratory are the binding mechanisms responsible for metal uptake. In this study, the binding behavior of Pb(II) to immobilized Datura innoxia biomaterial was investigated under different chemical conditions, such as ionic strength, the presence of calcium, and pH. Regularized regression analysis was employed to derive the corresponding affinity distributions. Two classes of binding sites were determined, having mean affinity of approximately 200 and 10(5) M-1, depending on solution conditions. Variations in apparent affinity distributions with ionic strength and pH suggest the low-affinity sites involve sulfonates and carboxylates in an ion exchange process. The high-affinity sites are proposed to result from the coordination of carboxylates to Pb2+ ions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, there is still very little known about the specific cellular enzyme activities involved in interactions with these devices. The current study investigates the nature of candidate enzymes that may be involved in the degradation of polymeric biomaterials through the use of specific enzyme inhibitor agents. When MDM were incubated with a polycarbonate-based polyurethane (PCNU) synthesized with C-14-labeled hexane diisocyanate (HDI), polycarbonate diol and butanediol (BD) (referred to as C-14-HD1431). the radiolabel release (RR) measured was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (serine protease/esterase inhibitors), and sodium fluoride (NaF) (a carboxyl esterase (CXE) inhibitor). Sodium taurocholate (NaT) (a cholesterol esterase (CE) stimulator) had little effect on RR. The two candidate enzymes proposed were CE and CXE, bused on the fact that both were identified by immunoblotting in the releasate of MDM following 48 It incubation with C-14-HD1431. The effect of the above reagents on the RR caused by purified CE and CXE, was measured and compared to changes in their activity with p-nitrophenylbutyrate (PNB). The effect of NaF on MDM was similar to that of purified CXE (inhibitory on both RR and lysate esterase activity), suggesting the involvement of CXE. However, NaT inhibited the PNB activity of purified CXE, but had no effect on MDM-mediated RR or PNB activity, implicating another esterase in the biomaterial degradation. Since NaT stimulated CE-mediated RR and PNB activity, it may also be involved in MDM-niecliated biodegradation of PCNUs. The results of these Studies point to both esterases as being candidates. However. the current methods were unable to determine the relative contribution of each one to the observed biodegradation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Blend polymers of PHBHHx/PHB were fabricated into three-dimensional porous scaffolds by the salt-leaching method. Chondrocytes isolated from rabbit articular cartilage (RAC) were seeded on the scaffolds and incubated over 28 days, with change of the culture medium every 4 days. PHB scaffold was taken as a control. Methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltertra-zolium bromide) assay was used to quantitatively examine the proliferation of chondrocytes. Results showed that chondrocytes proliferated better on the PHBHHx/PHB scaffolds than on PHB one. The maximal cell densities were all observed after 7 days of incubation. As for the blend polymers, cells grew better on scaffolds consisting of PHBHHx/PHB in ratios of 2:1 and 1:2 than they did on PHBHHx/PHB of 1:1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also showed that large quantities of chondrocytes grew initially on the surface of the scaffold. After 7 days, they further grew into the open pores of the blend polymer scaffolds. Morphologically, cells found on the surface of the scaffold exhibited a flat appearance and slowly form confluent cell multilayers starting from 14 to 28 days of the growth. In contrast, cells showed rounded morphology, formed aggregates and islets inside the scaffolds. In addition, chondrocytes proliferated on the scaffold and preserved their phenotype for up to 28 days. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Decomposition of HA to beta-TCP was suppressed due to the substitution of F- for OH-, consequently forming fluor-hydroxyapatite (FHA) solid solution. This suppression of decomposition allowed the production of a fully dense body, which retained both high flexural strength and fracture toughness.

In method 1, gelatin and GA were mixed in three different proportions (64:1, 128:1, and 256:1) before coating. In method II, a newly formed 5% gelatin membrane was cross-linked with a 2.5% GA solution. All coatings were hydrophilic, as determined from the measurement of contact angle for a drop of water on the surface. Bovine coronary arterial endothelial cells were shown to grow well on the surface modified by method II at 72 h.

In the first, a brief history of the use of miniature specimens for characterizing the mechanical behavior of materials in general is given. In the second part, several trends in literature reports of small punch and small shear punch tests of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene and acrylic bone cement specimens are examined critically. In this exercise, special attention is paid to one test metric; namely, the work to failure [which is the area under the punch load (P) versus punch displacement (A) plot up to the failure point]. In the third part of the article, seven key issues in this field are discussed. In each case, the gaps in the current knowledge base are pointed out. Among those issues are determination of sensitivity of test results to test variables, development of methods for converting P-Delta results to bulk material properties, and constitutive modeling of the mechanical behavior of a polymeric biomaterial, under both small punch and small shear punch loading.

After 7 and 14 days, no significant difference was observed in the relative viability or alkaline phosphatase activity of primary rat calvarial osteoblasts cultured in the presence or absence of degrading polymer networks, indicating that the degradation products had no detrimental effect on the function or activity of the cultured cells. The tissue response to preformed lactic acid networks implanted in rats consisted of a mild inflammatory response with an increase in fibrous capsule thickness and inflammation correlating with faster degrading polymer compositions. This relatively neutral response is indicative of a biocompatible, degradable polymer that has potential medical applications. Finally, porous scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in rats, and vascularized fibrous tissue infiltration was highly dependent on the scaffold porosity and architecture. This finding indicates that an in situ forming porous scaffold of this composition may support the infiltration of surrounding vascularized tissue, and thus be applicable to orthopedic treatments of large bone defects.

One hundred forty-four tissue specimens were assessed: 96 sutured samples (48 in which a centrally located suture was placed at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis, whereas in the remaining 48, a centrally located suture was placed at a 45degrees angle to the longitudinal axis, in sets of 12 samples each, sewn with sutures made of Gore-Tex, nylon, Prolene, or silk), and 48 unsutured controls. Each group of 24 samples sewn at one angle or the other with the different suture materials was assayed together with a corresponding control group of 12 unsutured samples. The mean tensile strengths in the unsutured controls ranged between 30.16 MPa and 43.42 MPa, whereas those of the sutured sets ranged from 14.68 MPa to 21,91 MPa, The latter presented a statistically significant loss of resistance (p < 0.01) when compared with the unsutured tissue samples. The angle of the suture with respect to the longitudinal axis influenced the degree of shear stress produced by the suture, as well as the behavior of the different suture materials used. The set of samples sewn with Prolene appeared to be that most sensitive to changes in the angle of the suture, whereas tissue sewn at a 45degrees angle with Gore-Tex presented lower shear stress values in comparison with samples in which the other three materials were used. A method of tissue selection based on morphological and mechanical criteria was used to ensure the homogeneity of the results in such a way that the coefficients of determination (R-2) for the stress/strain curve fitting equation ranged between 0.888 and 0.995. This excellent fit made it possible, applying regression analysis, to predict the mechanical behavior of a specimen by determining that of a contiguous tissue sample. Thus, it should be possible, at least theoretically, to characterize the behavior of a specific region or zone of the biomaterial. In conclusion, ostrich pericardium exhibits strong resistance to rupture, even when sutured. The selection method used ensures the homogeneity of the samples and, thus, of the results. The angle of the suture with respect to the longitudinal axis, where the load is centered, determines the shear stress produced by the suture and the mechanical behavior of each suture material.

This study describes a novel basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) delivery system synthesized by the conjugation of a structure-stabilizing polymer, hyaluronate (HA), with a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, heparin (HP), that has inherent specific binding sites for members of the FGF family. The biopolymers were formed via stable amine or labile imine bonds v coupling amine-modified HA with oxidized heparin. The addition of recombinant human FGF-2 resulted in the rapid binding of FGF-2 to the heparin segment of the hyaluronate-heparin (HAHP) conjugate, The FGF-2 was released in vitro from the imine-bonded (HAHPi) gets in the form of FGF-2-heparin complexes through the hydrolysis of the imine bonds. In contrast, the release of growth factor from the more stable amine-bonded (HAHPa) gels required treatment with free heparin or enzymatic digestion of the hyaluronate segment. Functional analysis of the released FGF-2 showed that the HAHP conjugate gels increased both the stability and activity of the growth factor.

The mechanical properties and biological behaviors of the composite were investigated by mechanical and in vivo studies. The existence of Ti metal phase can promote the dehydration and decomposition of HA ceramic phase into the more stable calcium phosphate phases, such as alpha-Ca-3(PO4)(2) (alpha-TCP) and Ca4O(PO4)(2) at high temperatures. Comparing with pure HA ceramic manufactured under the same conditions, HA-20 vol % Ti composite with higher fracture toughness (0.987 MPa m(1/2)), bending strength (78.59 MPa), work of fracture (12.8J/m(2)), porosity (9.8%) and lower elastic modulus (75.91 GPa) is more suitable for use as hard tissue replacement. Crack deflection is the chief toughening mechanism in the composite. Histological evaluation by light microscope shows HA-20 vol % Ti composite implant could be partially integrated with newborn bone tissues after 3 weeks and fully osteointegrated at 12 weeks in vivo. The excellent biological properties of HA-20 vol % Ti composite may be contributed to the coexistence of high porosity and the decomposition products of HA phase in the composite.

The precipitates filtered were dried in a freeze drier or naturally dried in the air at 25 degreesC. The naturally dried cakes had open channels of 5-15 mum in diameters, which were three-dimensionally and regularly developed over the whole samples, and showed a pretty good mechanical strength. The channels that were formed at spaces among the HAp/collagen particles, cross-linked one another, which had been filled up with water before its evaporation. The ordering state of the open channels depended on the degree of cross-linkage with glutaraldehyde; the optimal self-organized state was found when 30 molecules of glutaraldehyde were added per collagen molecule, though an excess amount of glutaraldehyde suppressed the appearance of the ordered state. From SEM and FT-IR measurements, it was indicated that the self-organization in the HAp/collagen nanocompsites continuously occurred during the drying process together with the removal of water and the increase of the density.

It was also observed a reversible formation and disruption of -SO3- ...+H3N- according to the ionic strength of bathing solution. Thus the import of both -SO3H and -NH2 groups in a single gel is expected to induce a reversible hardening and softening of gel matrix through the formation of salt-linkages.

The most effective addition of TiO2 was about 8.7 wt% in this system glass. The activation energy difference between the base glass (no TiO2 added) and the glass containing most effective addition of TiO2 was more than 100 kJ/mol.

Observation of the samples in wet state by means of the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) enabled us to observe the calcium phosphate deposition process in situ over a number of days. One of the most important features of the study is that it was carried out on a single, unchanged titanium sample and the process was not at any stage interrupted.

Furthermore, dental implant surfaces exposed to the oral cavity must remain plaque-free. Such materials can be created under well-controlled conditions by modifying the surfaces of metals that contact those tissues. ""Tissue-compatible implants,"" which are compatible with all host tissues, must integrate with bone tissue, easily form hemidesmosomes, and prevent bacterial adhesion. This research was aimed at developing such tissue-compatible implants by modifying titanium surfaces using a dry process for closely adhering to the titanium substrate and ensuring good wear resistance. The process includes ion beam dynamic mixing (thin calcium phosphates), ion implantation, titania spraying, ion plating and ion beam mixing. At the bone tissue/implant interface, a thin calcium phosphate coating and rapid heating with infrared radiation was effective in controlling the dissolution without cracking the coating. This thin calcium phosphate coating may directly promote osteogenisis, but also enable immobilization of functional proteins or drugs such as bisphosphonate for dug delivery system. At the oral fluid/implant interface, an alumina coating and F+-implantation were responsible for inhibiting the adhesion of microbial plaque. In conclusion, dry-process surface modification is useful in controlling the physicochemical nature of surfaces, including the surface energy and the surface electrical charge, and in developing tissue-compatible implants.","Tokyo Dent Coll, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Chiba 2618502, Japan; Tokyo Dent Coll, Dept Clin Pathophysiol, Chiba 2618502, Japan; Tokyo Dent Coll, Dept Pathol, Chiba 2618502, Japan","Yoshinari, M (reprint author), Tokyo Dent Coll, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Chiba 2618502, Japan.",yosinari@tdc.ac.jp,,,,,,30,18,20,0,22,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",1345-9678,1347-5320,,MATER TRANS,Mater.

Studies of protein. binding domains reveal molecular architectures with specific chemical moieties that provide a framework for selective recognition of target biomolecules in aqueous environment. By matching functionality and positioning of chemical residues, we have been successful in designing biomimetic polymer networks that specifically bind biomolecules in aqueous environments. Our work addresses the preparation, behavior, and dynamics of the three-dimensional structure of biomimetic polymers for selective recognition via non-covalent complexation. In particular, the synthesis and characterization of recognitive gels for the macromolecular recognition of D-glucose is highlighted. Novel copolymer networks containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and functional monomers such as acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and acrylamide were synthesized in dimethyl sulfoxide (polar, aprotic solvent) and water (polar, protic solvent) via UV-free radical polymerization. Polymers were characterized by single and competitive equilibrium and kinetic binding studies, single and competitive fluorescent and confocal microscopy studies, dynamic network swelling studies, and ATR-FTIR. Results qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate effective glucose-binding polymers in aqueous solvent. Owing to the presence of template, the imprinting process resulted in a more macroporous structure as exhibited by dynamic swelling experiments and confocal microscopy. Polymerization kinetic studies suggest that the template molecule has more than a dilution effect on the polymerization, and the effect of the template is related strongly to the rate of propagation. In addition, PEG containing networks were micropatterned to fabricate microstructures, which would be the basis for micro-diagnostic and tissue engineering devices. Utilizing photolithography techniques, polymer micropatterns Of a variety of shapes and dimensions have been created on polymer and silicon substrates using UV free-radical polymerizations with strict spatial control. Micropatterns were characterized using optical microscopy, SEM, and profilometry. The processes and analytical techniques presented are applicable to other stimuli-sensitive and recognitive networks for biomolecules, in which hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, or ionic contributions will direct recognition.

Polyesters with allyl pendent groups were synthesized by melt copolymerization of succinic anhydride (SA) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) in the presence of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride (BTMAC) as a catalyst. Functionality of some polyesters was reduced by replacing a part of AGE with butyl glycidyl ether (BGE). The epoxidation of the polyesters obtained was carried out using m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA). The multifunctional epoxy-polyester resins were cured using different amounts of glutaric anhydride (GA) and without use of it. The cured resins were degraded in aqueous buffer of pH = 7.4 at 70 and 37degreesC. The hydrolytic degradation was monitored by determination Of mass loss. Fracture surfaces of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Influence of the composition of initial resins and amount of GA used on the hydrolytic degradation was studied. The products of degradation were identified by HPLC and H-1-NMR.

The molecular mechanisms that biological molecules utilize to sense and respond provide interesting models for the development of ""smart"" polymeric biomaterials with biomimetic properties. An important example of this is the protein coat of viruses, which contains peptide units that facilitate the trafficking of the virus into the cell via endocytosis, followed by delivery of the genetic material out of the endosome into the cytoplasm, and from there into the nucleus. We have designed several new types of synthetic polymers to facilitate intracellular trafficking of drugs. One of these has been designed to mimic the specific peptides on viral coats that facilitate endosomal escape. Another has been designed to contain pH-degradable bonds, facilitating endosomal escape of the drug only after the bonds are degraded at the acidic pHs of the endosomes. Both types of polymer are responsive to the lowered pH within endosomes, leading to disruption of the endosomal membrane and release of important biomolecular drugs such as DNA, RNA, peptides and proteins to the cytoplasm before they are trafficked to lysosomes and degraded by lysosomal enzymes. In this article, we review our work on the design, synthesis and action of such smart, pH-sensitive polymers.

These films exhibit an exponential growth regime where the thickness increases exponentially with the number of deposited layers, leading to micrometer thick films. Previously such a growth regime was suggested to result from an ""in"" and ""out"" diffusion of the PLL chains through the film during buildup, but direct evidence was lacking. The use of dye-conjugated polyelectrolytes now allows a direct three-dimensional visualization of the film construction by introducing fluorescent polyelectrolytes at different steps during the film buildup. We find that, as postulated, PILL diffuses throughout the film down into the substrate after each new PILL injection and out of the film after each PILL rinsing and further after each HA injection. As PILL reaches the outer layer of the film it interacts with the incoming HA, forming the new HA/PLL layer. The thickness of this new layer is thus proportional to the amount of PILL that diffuses out of the film during the buildup step, which explains the exponential growth regime. HA layers are also visualized but no diffusion is observed, leading to a stratified film structure. We believe that such a diffusion-based buildup mechanism explains most of the exponential-like growth processes of polyelectrolyte multilayers reported in the literature.","Ecole Europeenne Chim Polymeres & Mat Strasbourg, F-67087 Strasbourg 2, France; Univ Strasbourg 1, Ctr Rech Odontol, INSERM, U424, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; CNRS, Inst Biol Mol Plantes, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Strasbourg 1, CNRS, Inst Charles Sadron, F-67083 Strasbourg, France","Schaaf, P (reprint author), Ecole Europeenne Chim Polymeres & Mat Strasbourg, 25 Rue Becquerel, F-67087 Strasbourg 2, France.",,"SCHAAF, Pierre/J-2751-2016; Lavalle, Philippe/E-6328-2016; Richert, Ludovic/B-5006-2008","SCHAAF, Pierre/0000-0001-7423-5492; Lavalle, Philippe/0000-0001-8798-912X; Richert, Ludovic/0000-0003-4479-5418; PICART, Catherine/0000-0002-4854-6366; PICART, Catherine/0000-0003-0130-1000","NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC004336, DC04336]",,,35,648,656,2,162,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Consequently, platelet GpIIb-IIIa receptor inhibitors are successfully used during stent implantation procedures to prevent thrombosis. However, currently a new generation of stems contains surface coating, which changes the surface to more hydrophobic or hydrophilic. This change markedly affects the interaction of platelets and may influence the efficiency of GpIIb-IIla inhibitors. Materials and methods: To study the influence of the wettability of biomaterials on the effectiveness of abciximab, 5-cm polyethylene gradients with contact angles of 100 to 40 were made by means of glow discharge. Fresh whole blood with or without abciximab was recirculated over this gradient. Results: Inhibition of platelet adhesion by abciximab was maximal, but not complete, on the hydrophobic and moderate hydrophobic part of the gradient. with contact angles of 55degrees to 90degrees. Percentage inhibition by abciximab was maximal around 60degrees. Conclusions: Intermediate hydrophobicity of currently applied stent materials, such as stainless steel, seems optimal in combination with abciximab. However, on hydrophobic and particularly on hydrophilic materials, abciximab is less effective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Improved adhesion and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells are demonstrated on different substrates coated with the FG-GF/FG-GF-GEL mixture, compared with the respective bare surfaces. The strength of adhesion of endothelial cells on the coated matrices was found to be adequate to resist shear stress when monolayers were exposed to forces of flow in an in vitro parallel plate flow chamber. The monolayers maintained physiological nonthrombogenic character as evidenced by in vitro platelet adhesion and response to agonist measurements. Nitric oxide synthesis by cells grown on the study matrices was also found to be normal. Thus, the matrix composition and the coating technique, as presented here, can be easily applied to generate tissue-engineered biomaterials with a nonthrombogenic endothelial cell monolayer for cardiovascular implants.

With this purpose in mind, we have attempted to synthesize a novel nontoxic biodegradable lysine diisocyanate (LDI)- and glucose-based polymer via polymerization of highly purified LDI with glucose and its subsequent hydration to form a spongy matrix. The LDI-glucose polymer was degradable in aqueous solutions at 37, 22, and 4degreesC, and yielded lysine and glucose as breakdown products. The degradation products of the LDI-glucose polymer did not significantly affect the pH of the solution. The physical properties of the polymer were found to be adequate for supporting cell growth in vitro, as evidenced by the fact that rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) attached to the polymer matrix, remained viable on its surface, and formed multilayered confluent cultures with retention of their phenotype over a period of 2 to 4 weeks. These observations suggest that the LDI-glucose polymer and its degradation products were nontoxic in vitro. Further examination in vivo over 8 weeks revealed that subcutaneous implantation of hydrated matrix degraded in vivo three times faster than in vitro. The implanted polymer was not immunogenic and did not induce antibody responses in the host. Histological analysis of the implanted polymer showed that LDI-glucose polymer induced a minimal foreign body reaction, with formation of a capsule around the degrading polymer. The results suggest that biodegradable peptide-based polymers can be synthesized, and may potentially find their way into biomedical applications because of their biodegradability and biocompatibility.","Carnegie Mellon Univ, Bone Tissue Engn Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Oral Med & Pathol, Sch Dent Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Hollinger, JO (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Bone Tissue Engn Ctr, 218 Smith Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",hollinge@cs.cmu.edu,,,NCCIH NIH HHS [R01 AT000646],,,33,74,77,1,23,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-4947,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,OCT,2002.0,8,5,,,,,771,785,,10.1089/10763270260424132,,,,15,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,610AH,WOS:000178938200005,12459056.0,Green Accepted,,,2019-02-25

In addition, the response of these skin equivalents to wounding mimicks that of animal models in terms of the kinetics of reepithelialization, the spatiotemporal distribution of proliferating cells in and around the-wound, the unique phenotype exhibited by the cells in the newly formed epidermis, the upregulation of key molecular anchors that initiate cell migration, and the formation of basement membrane during wound closure.

The evolution of the film chemical composition and bonding configuration has been followed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies. The study of samples exposed to the atmospheric humidity revealed important changes and the structural rearrangement of the local environment of the Si-O groups. A gradual shifting of the Si-O stretching vibration to higher wavenumbers, saturation of the Si-O non-bridging bonds and relief of the strain in the network have been observed. It has been demonstrated that the bioactive glass properties are preserved stable and unaltered when the films are maintained in alcohol. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The biodegradable material should permit rapid cellular growth and delayed degradation with minimal inflammation. We compared a new material, epsilon-caprolactone-co-L-lactide sponge reinforced with knitted poly-L-lactide fabric (PCLA), to gelatin (GEL) and polyglycolic acid (PEA), which are previously evaluated materials. Methods-Syngenic rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs, 2X10(6)) were seeded onto GEL, PEA, and PCLA patches and cultured (n=11 per group). The DNA content in each patch was measured at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after seeding. Histological examination was performed 2 weeks after seeding. Cell-seeded patches were employed to replace a surgically created defect in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) of rats (n=5 per group). Histology was studied at 8 weeks following implantation. Results-In vitro studies showed that the DNA content increased significantly (P<0.05) in all patches between 1 and 3 weeks after seeding. Histology and staining SMCs for anti-a-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) revealed better growth of cells in the interstices of the grafts with GEL and PCLA than the PGA graft. In vivo studies demonstrated that seeded SMCs survived at least 8 weeks after the patch implantation in all groups. PCLA scaffolds were replaced by more cells with larger alphaSMA-positive areas and by more extracellular matrix with larger elastin-positive areas than with GEL and PEA. The patch did not thin and expanded significantly. The GEL and PGA patches thinned and expanded. All grafts had complete endothelialization on the endocardial surface. Conclusions-SMC-seeded biodegradable materials can be employed to repair the RVOT. The novel PCLA patches permitted better cellular penetration in vitro and did not thin or dilate in vivo and did not produce an inflammatory response. The cell-seeded PCLA patch may permit the construction of an autologous patch to repair congenital heart defects.","Univ Toronto, Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Cardiovasc Surg,Toronto Gen Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada","Li, RK (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Cardiovasc Surg,Toronto Gen Res Inst, CCRW 1-815,200 Elizabeth St, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada.",,,,,,,31,51,56,3,10,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,SEP 24,2002.0,106,13,,S,,,I176,I182,,10.1161/01.cir.0000032901.55215.cc,,,,7,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,599DM,WOS:000178318900031,12354729.0,,,,2019-02-25

The experimental conditions of loading pressures, pH, and HA concentration were set to closely correspond to physiological human knee-joint conditions. From the force and optical (refractive index) measurements, it was concluded that, like other negatively charged polyelectrolytes, HA does not naturally adsorb on the mica surface which is hydrophihc and weakly negatively charged at physiological conditions: the polymer solution exhibits the bulk viscosity (22.5 +/- 1.5 cP) for films thicker than about 0.4 mum of the polymer, whereas for thinner films, the viscosity decreases monotonically toward the value of the pure electrolyte solution (1 cP) as HA is extruded from between the surfaces. This is indicative of a repulsive ""depletion"" interaction of HA with each mica surface and to a weakly attractive polymer-mediated force between the two surfaces. Thus, free HA in synovial fluid is not expected to act as a good ""boundary lubricant."" Relaxation measurements on approaching and receding surfaces in HA solutions were also performed, and it is shown that the presence of HA in the bulk solution can improve ""hydrodynamic"" modes of lubrication, for example, by assuaging the compression stroke. The study includes information that is beneficial to researchers working with biomaterials viscosupplementation devices.

This study was designed to evaluate specific humoral immune responses following repeated intraperitoneal implantations of collagen-impregnated polyester (Dacron) prosthetic segments into LEWIS rats. Serum antibody detection was performed by enzyme immunoassay with the prosthetic segments as a target. Cutoff values for antibody positivity were greater than or equal to the 99th percentile for control rats. Polymer immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were significantly increased (p < 0.05) by repeated implantation and were subsequently followed until experimental day 293. Antibody formation was significantly enhanced through the application of complete Freund's adjuvant in combination with the first implantation. All rats within this group were antibody-positive on day 53, but only 6 of 10 animals that received the prosthesis without the adjuvant were. After preincubation of sera with bovine collagen type I (solid phase adsorbed or in solution), polymer antibody binding was discovered not to be diminished, indicating that the IgG antibodies detected were not directed against the prosthesis impregnation. Furthermore, a significant correlation was obtained between polymer antibody binding to collagen-impregnated and nonimpregnated prostheses (r(s) = 0.797, p < 0.001). There was no substantiated correlation between antibody binding to polyester and to an irrelevant polymer (Tecoflex EG 80). We conclude that specific polymer antibodies may indeed provide an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing as well as a possible serological marker of an inflammatory response to implants.

Anti-gentamicin antibody was immobilized in a mesoporous sol-gel material using tetramethoxysilane as a precursor and poly(ethylene glycol) as a template. The sol-gel glass was used to develop an immumoaffinity column for the flow-injection immunoassay of gentamicin. Little unspecific adsorption of gentamicin on the sol-gel and no antibody leaching under harsh elution conditions were found. The immunoassay is based on the competition between gentamicin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled gentamicin for a limited number of encapsulated antibody binding sites. NaOH solution of 5 x 10(-3) mol/L is used for the regeneration of encapsulated antibody binding sites after each measurement, which allows the immunoreactor to be used for up to 20 times without any loss of reactivity. Sample preconcentration is not needed and a single assay can be performed within 10 min. The calibration for gentamicin has a working range of 250-5000 ng/mL with a detection limit of 200 ng/mL, which is close to that of the fluorescence immunoassay and fluorescence polarization immunoassay using the same reactants. Comparison of the results from this method with that obtained from HPLC showed an excellent correlation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

When the surface of the waveguide is exposed to different solutions, the peaks in the spectrum shift due to molecular interactions with the surface. Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) is a highly sensitive technique that is capable of real-time monitoring of these interactions. Since this integrated optical method is based on the measurement of the polarizability density (i.e., refractive index) in the vicinity of the waveguide surface, radioactive, fluorescent or other kinds of labeling are not required. In addition, measurement of at least two guided modes enables the absolute mass of adsorbed Molecules to be determined. In this article, the technique will be described in some detail, and applications from different areas will be discussed.

RKKP(R)-coated and uncoated (controls) YSTZ cylinders were implanted in the distal femoral epiphyses of 14 Sprague Dawley rats under general anaesthesia. At the experimental times of 30 and 60 days after sacrifice, histomorphometry and SEM microanalysis were performed on methylmethacrylate-embedded undecalcified sections to determine the osteointegration rate. At 30 days, a significantly higher affinity index was demonstrated in vivo by histomorphometric evaluation in RKKP(R)-coated versus uncoated YSTZ implants (p<0.05); at 60 days, the coated implants behaved better than controls (affinity index of +32%), but the difference observed lay within the statistical uncertainty. SEM analysis demonstrated better bone adhesion to the material in RKKP(R)-coated YSTZ at both 30 and 60 days. These findings suggest that YSTZ coated with the bioactive glass named RKKP(R) enhances osteointegration of ceramics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Stable and homogeneous Bioglass' coatings on the surface of PDLLA foams as well as infiltration of Bioglass(R) particles throughout the porous network were achieved using a slurry-dipping technique in conjunction with pre-treatment of the foams in ethanol. The quality of the bioactive glass coatings was reproducible in terms of thickness and microstructure. Additionally, electrophoretic deposition was investigated as an alternative method for the fabrication of PDLLA foam/Bioglass(R) composite materials. In vitro studies in simulated body fluid (SBF) were performed to study the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the surface of PDLLA/Bioglass(R) composites.

The bridge formation between COL fibers could be assessed from C Is and N Is band spectrum. The dehydration of swelling water during drying led to the reduction of linking distance for pendant GA between COL fibrils and contributed to further cross-linkage reaction.

To examine the degree of transformation, a commercial, coarsely particulate bone mineral biomaterial produced by prolonged deproteination, defatting, dehydration, and heating (donor material) was compared with similar particles of human bone (recipient material) prepared optimally by low-temperature milling. The two powders were freeze-substituted and embedded without thawing in Lowicryl K4M before sectioning for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (other aliquots were processed by traditional TEM methods). To maximize resolution, electron micrographs were image-enhanced by digitization and printed as negatives using a Polaroid Sprint Scan 45. In addition to their morphology, the particles were examined for antigenicity (specific by reference to fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-conjugated fibronectin, and nonspecific by reference to general FITC-conjugated immunoglobulins). Results showed that the optimally prepared human bone fragments stained discretely for fibronectin with negligible background autofluorescence. In contrast, the bioimplant fragments stained extensively with this and any other FITC-conjugated antibody and, unlike fresh bone, it also autofluoresced a uniform yellow. This difference was also expressed structurally and, although the bioimplant mineral consisted of rhomboidal plates up to 200 nm across and 10 nm thick, the optimally prepared bone mineral was composed of numerous clusters of 5-nm-wide sinuous calcified filaments of variable density and indeterminate length (which became straight needles 50 nm long and 5 run thick following traditional chemical TEM fixation/staining). It was concluded that the inorganic phase of bone is both morphologically and immunologically transmutable and that, in biomaterials, the transformation is apparently so great that a broad indigenous antigenicity is unmasked, increasing the likelihood of resorption or rejection. This marked change may also provide preliminary insight into a more modest natural aging phenomenon with the localized lateral fusion of calcified filaments into less flexible, more immunologically reactive fenestrated plates.

Continuous improvements in micro-electronics, as well as in the development of biomaterials and stable insulin solutions, have led to the availability of implantable pumps able to infuse insulin by the peritoneal route, in a continuous and programmable way, for several years. These systems represent the most efficient and physiological mode of insulin therapy at the present time. More recently, we have demonstrated during clinical trials that intravascular, implantable, glucose sensors using glucose-oxidase were able to measure with good accuracy real-time blood glucose for several months. The combination of these two devices to form a prototype of implantable artificial beta cell, designated as Long Term Sensor System, allowed us to perform the first trials of closed-loop insulin delivery according to sensor signal for periods of 48 hours in type 1 diabetic patients. This mode of functioning appeared to be feasible and able to establish glucose control closer to physiology than the use of implantable pumps in open-loop, i.e. by adapting insulin delivery according to capillary blood glucose. Although algorithms tuning automated insulin delivery are improvable, the success of these initial trials materializes the perspective of a possible restoration of physiological insulin function by the mean of an implanted artificial beta cell in diabetic patients.","Hop Lapeyronie, Serv Malad Endocriniennes, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France","Renard, E (reprint author), Hop Lapeyronie, Serv Malad Endocriniennes, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,32,7,7,0,2,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",1262-3636,,,DIABETES METAB,Diabetes Metab.,SEP,2002.0,28,4,2,,,,S19,S25,,,,,,7,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,602MY,WOS:000178510100004,,,,,2019-02-25

The governing equations of the mechanics of solids with a growing mass are revisited within the framework of finite deformation continuum thermodynamics. The multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into its elastic and growth parts is employed to study the growth of isotropic, transversely isotropic, and orthotropic biomaterials. An explicit representation of the growth, part of the deformation gradient is given in each case, which leads to an effective incremental formulation in the analysis of the stress-modulated growth process. The rectangular components of the instantaneous elastic moduli tensor are derived corresponding to selected forms of the elastic strain energy function. Physically appealing structures of the stress-dependent evolution equations for the growth induced stretch ratios are proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fourteen patients (4 men and 10 women), with a mean age of 59 +/- 19 years, suffering from chronic epiphora caused by common canaliculus stenosis were operated on (18 procedures: 14 unilateral, 4 bilateral). We used a modified Dupuy-Dutemps technique. The anterior face of the lacrimal sac was cut as a flap, which was secured with the posterior nasal mucosal flap for the posterior anastomosis plane. The common canaliculus stenosis and the external face of the lacrimal sac were excised guided by the operating microscope so as to put in place a bicanalicular device, which was left for 6 months. The anterior plane of anastomosis was made 722 of a Goretex((R)) patch or FTFE(R) (Polytetrafluoroethylene((R))) placed under the deep face of the orbicularis muscle. The procedure was successful in 15 of the 18 cases (success rated 83.3%). Among the three failures, two were due to the early loss of the bicanalicular stent and one to anastomosis fibrosis. This technique made it possible to restore lacrimal pathway anatomy, which was severely modified by the dacryocystorhinostomy procedure and to protect the anastomosis from fibrosis by the surrounding tissues. Biomaterials such as Goretex((R)) and PTFE(R) are valuable tools for this technique. In common canaliculus stenosis, restoring the lacrimal pathway with biomaterials such as Goretex((R)) or PTFE(R) improves the functional results.","CHU Angers, Serv Ophtalmol, F-49033 Angers 01, France","Ebran, JM (reprint author), CHU Angers, Serv Ophtalmol, 4 Rue Larrey, F-49033 Angers 01, France.",,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0181-5512,,,J FR OPHTALMOL,J.

Following confirmation of the conjugation by inhibition of trinitrophenyl (TNP) binding, female Balb/c mice received HEMA conjugated to mouse serum albumin (MSA) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant or saline subcutaneously. ELISA was used to determine the serum antibody responses to native and modified MSA. IL-2 production in spleen cell cultures stimulated with HEMA-conjugated MSA was measured. HEMA reacted with serum albumin at physiological conditions. HEMA-conjugated MSA induced IL-2 secretion and production of IgG antibodies to native MSA. The results suggest that modification of an endogenous protein like serum albumin with HEMA may defeat the control of immune responses to this self-protein.","Fac Odontol, Dept Endodontol Oral Diagnosis, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Fac Med, Dept Rheumatol, Gothenburg, Sweden","Sandberg, E (reprint author), Fac Odontol, Dept Endodontol Oral Diagnosis, Box 450, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,19,21,21,1,2,INT AMER ASSOC DENTAL RESEARCHI A D R/A A D R,ALEXANDRIA,"1619 DUKE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-3406 USA",0022-0345,,,J DENT RES,J.

Histological and microhardness analyses were performed at 30 and 45 days after implant surgery. Results: After implantation of xenogenic DBM, bone healing areas of the aged and young groups showed a significant increase in the formation of newly mineralized bone relative to controls. Measurements of trabecular thickness on day 45 revealed no differences between newly formed and preexisting bone in the young group, while control values were lower. Microhardness measurements demonstrated that newly mineralized bone, either induced by DBM or not, and preexisting bone were comparable in terms of trabecular hardness after 45 days. Conclusions: In conclusion, xenogenic DBM seems to be effective in bone defect healing, since it increases mineralized tissue volume. In both DBM-filled and empty sites, age seems to have a detrimental effect on the volume of new bone formation but no influence on bone maturation.","Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Res Inst Codivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Milan, Dept Oral Med & Pathol, Milan, Italy; Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy","Torricelli, P (reprint author), Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, Serv Chirurg Sperimentale, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",paola.torricelli@ior.it,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016; Cochis, Andrea/U-5264-2018; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/J-5298-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Cochis, Andrea/0000-0003-2455-8239; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/0000-0001-7494-9970; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969; RIMONDINI, LIA/0000-0002-7785-2282",,,,54,15,19,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-3492,1943-3670,,J PERIODONTOL,J.
