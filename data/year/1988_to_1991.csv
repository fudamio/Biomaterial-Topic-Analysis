This Bioregister is a so-called ""spontaneous"" ad hoc recording system whose efficiency depends largely on the collaboration of physicians. Thus, the efficiency and rationality of the use of biomaterials can certainly be improved.

The putative enhancement of glutaraldehyde crosslinking by lysine was investigated in three model systems: bovine pericardium, collagen membranes, and bovine serum albumin. Repetitive sequential treatment of bovine pericardium with glutaraldehyde and lysine and finally with formaldehyde produced a matrix which, by the two criteria used (shrinkage temperature and urea/SDS soluble collagen), was shown to be more highly crosslinked than pericardium fixed in glutaraldehyde alone. Essentially the same results were obtained when membranes prepared from pepsin-soluble pericardial collagen were subjected to sequential glutaraldehyde and lysine treatments, reaching shrinkage temperatures of more than 90-degrees-C. Heart valves prepared from lysine-enhanced glutaraldehyde crosslinked bovine pericardium were tested in vitro in an accelerated fatigue tester and have been shown to behave satisfactorily after 300 million cycles. These additional crosslinks proved to be stable in saline at 37-degrees-C. Studies on bovine serum albumin attempted to get an insight into the mechanisms of lysine enhancement of glutaraldehyde crosslinking by treating sequentially albumin with glutaraldehyde and lysine and analysis of the products by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. These studies suggest that free amino groups exposed by proteins are initially reacted with glutaraldehyde and then bridged by the diamino compound (lysine) producing more extensive intermolecular crosslinking than glutaraldehyde alone.","ACAD MED SCI, MED RES CTR, CARDIOVASC SURG RES DEPT, POB 118-4300, Targu Mures, ROMANIA",,,,,,,,24,42,42,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

In this study different molecular weight PEO molecules were covalently attached to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films using cyanuric chloride chemistry. Prior to the PEO immobilization, amino groups were introduced onto the PET films by exposing them to an allylamine plasma glow discharge. The amino groups on the PET film were next activated with cyanuric chloride and then reacted with bis-amino PEO. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, water contact angle measurements, gravimetric analysis, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The adsorption of I-125-labeled baboon fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin was studied from buffer solutions. Gravimetric analysis indicated that the films grafted with the low-molecular-weight PEO contained many more PEO molecules than the surfaces grafted with higher-molecular-weight PEO. The high-molecular-weight PEO surfaces, however, exhibited greater wettability (lower water contact angles) and less protein adsorption than the low-molecular-weight PEO surfaces. Adsorption of albumin and fibrinogen to the PEO surfaces decreased with increasing PEO molecular weight up to 3500. A further increase in molecular weight resulted in only slight decreases in protein adsorption. Protein adsorption studies as a function of buffer ionic strength suggest that there may be an ionic interaction between the protein and the allylamine surface. The trends in protein adsorption together with the water contact angle results and the gravimetric analysis suggest that a kind of ""cooperative"" water structuring around the larger PEO molecules may create an ""excluded volume"" of the hydrated polymer coils. This may be an important factor contributing to the observed low protein adsorption behavior.","UNIV WASHINGTON, CTR BIOENGN, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,48,475,480,3,107,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The effect of these plasma proteins on bacterial surface properties resulted in strong increases of surface charge as measured by ion-exchange chromatography and with no effect on hydrophobicity, estimated as contact angles.

The hydrogel was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde using MgCl2 (water based) or toluenesulfonic acid (DMSO based) as the acid catalyst. The water-based gel was stiffer (compression modulus of 465 kPa) than the DMSO gel (compression modulus of 48.6 +/- 2.4 kPa). The terminal hydroxyl group of PEG (M(n) 2000 and 5000, with or without a monomethoxy end cap) was oxidized to an aldehyde by using an acetic anhydride-DMSO mixture or modified with a diisocyanatohexane to produce a terminal isocyanate. Optimum conversion to an aldehyde was realized at 8 h at room temperature, independent of molecular weight. Maximum conversion to the isocyanate occurred at 6 and 10 h/90-degrees-C for M(n) 2000 and 5000, respectively. Using the aldehyde-terminated PEG5000 in the presence of toluenesulfonic acid, XPS analysis of the immobilized product determined that an average maximum oxyethylene content of 71% was obtained after 4 h at 70-degrees-C. Both molecular weight species of poly(ethylene glycol isocyanate) were bound to PVA on the order of 74% oxyethylene content as measured by XPS. Covalent binding of PEG M(n) 5000 via an aldehyde had no effect on the advancing contact angle whereas immobilization through a urethane moiety resulted in a significant decrease, indicating that PEG dominated this surface in air. Since receding contact angles indicated total wetting of both modified and unmodified PVA surfaces, it was not possible to distinguish the presence of PEG from that of PVA on the surface of the gel in water. These surfaces are of potential interest as a means of reducing the thrombogenicity of cardiovascular biomaterials.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA; UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA",,,,,,,,35,41,43,0,39,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,NOV 11,1991.0,24.0,23,,,,,6065,6072,,10.1021/ma00023a003,,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,GQ428,WOS:A1991GQ42800003,,,,,2019-02-25

In chambers made of pure titanium, the number of leucocytes increased about twofold from 1.8 x 10(6)/ml to 4.1 x 10(6)/ml between 24 h and 6 d, whereas a larger increase from 2.1 x 10(6)/ml to 8.3 x 10(6)/ml was observed in the polytetrafluorethylene chambers. Irrespective of implant material, polymorphonuclear granulocytes constituted the vast majority of leucocytes (> 81%). After 24 h the leukotriene B4 content was slightly higher in polytetrafluorethylene chambers than in titanium chambers. In contrast to the titanium chambers, a marked increase in leukotriene B4 levels was detected in polytetrafluorethylene chambers 6 d after insertion, whereas the greatest amount of leukotriene B4 in titanium chambers was measured at 9 d. Interleukin 1 was only detected in both types of chambers after 6 d. The present study, together with previous findings, shows that the materials used in this study elicit different degrees of inflammatory reactions in the chamber exudate. Since the number of leucocytes in the exudate retrieved from the chambers correlated well with the leukotriene B4 levels, it is suggested that leukotriene B4, but not interleukin 1, may be an important mediator for polymorphonuclear granulocyte migration into the implant-tissue interface. The role of leukotriene B4 and interleukin 1 for other parts of the inflammatory process around biomaterials in soft tissue, such as cell adhesion and activation and microvascular changes and their potential roles for the development of the peri-implant tissue remains to be established.","GOTHENBURG UNIV,DEPT ANAT,POB 33031,S-40033 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN",,,,"Thomsen, Peter/0000-0003-3910-6665",,,,21,19,19,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,NOV,1991.0,12.0,9,,,,,827,830,,10.1016/0142-9612(91)90069-M,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,GT183,WOS:A1991GT18300006,1662545.0,,,,2019-02-25

Gas chromatography of the supernatant shows that substantial methanol is produced, along with trace amounts of N,N-dimethylethylene diamine.

Adhesion of causative bacteria to biomaterials is considered to be an essential step in these infections. We and others have shown that adhesion of CoNS to biomaterials may be mediated by protease-sensitive surface constituents. In the present study we expanded on these investigations by characterizing a biomaterial adhesin of Staphylococcus epidermidis 354 by using a strain-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 36.4). MAb 36.4 was strongly and exclusively reactive with strain 354 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which whole bacteria were used as antigens. Immunoblotting of cell wall polypeptides of strain 354 revealed strong reactivity with a 200- to 220-kDa band and a weaker reaction in the 100- to 110-kDa range. Preincubation of strain 354 with MAb 36.4 resulted in a 54 to 91% (mean +/- standard deviation, 74% +/- 14%; n = 10) inhibition of adhesion to polystyrene spheres. Fab fragments prepared from MAb 36.4 also inhibited adhesion effectively, indicating specific blocking of an adhesion antigen rather than aspecific inhibition. Immunogold electron microscopy with MAb 36.4 revealed deposition of gold particles on the cell surface and possibly also on fimbrialike surface projections. It is concluded that a surface-located protein antigen of S. epidermidis 354 recognized by MAb 36.4 acts as an adhesin mediating attachment to uncoated foreign material. It is speculated that this type of adhesion to biomaterials may play an important role in the pathogenesis of foreign body-related infections caused by CoNS.","STATE UNIV UTRECHT,EIJKMAN WINKLER LAB MED MICROBIOL,HEIDELBERGLAAN 100,3584 CH UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; STATE UNIV UTRECHT,DEPT MOLEC CELL BIOL,UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; UNIV CHILDRENS HOSP HET WILHELMINA KINDERZIEKENHUIS,3512 LK UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; BRETONNEAU HOSP,DEPT INFECT DIS,F-37044 TOURS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,33,84,84,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

In the present studies the focus was to determine the composition and distribution of proteins at the surface of these materials after contact with human blood plasma. On all materials, protein adsorption was detected and included identification of albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, fibronectin, Hageman factor (factor XII), factor VIII/von Willebrand factor, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and the complement protein C5. The amount of protein adsorbed decreased with an increase in the MPC composition and appeared to adsorb to the surfaces in a uniform and evenly distributed manner. Therefore, we suggest that MPC moieties play an important role in suppression of protein adsorption. From these findings, it is concluded that the reduction of protein adsorption at the blood contacting surface of phospholipid polymers may result in the inhibition of thrombus formation.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL,2085 ADELBERT RD,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,TOKYO 101,JAPAN; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-33849],,,34,366,370,6,73,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The customary approach to evaluating the role of this force, comparison of protein adsorption to a spectrum of solid surfaces spanning a range of hydrophobicities, is limited by incomplete control over surface chemical variables other than the overall hydrophobicity. We evaluate the importance of the hydrophobic interaction in protein adsorption, while maintaining constant surface properties, by addition of alcohols known to modulate the strength of the hydrophobic interaction in aqueous solutions. The responses of adsorption isotherms, dynamics, and lateral mobility of adsorbed proteins to changes in solvent composition demonstrate the primary role of the hydrophobic interaction in the adsorption of ribonuclease A to polystyrene surfaces. Manipulating the magnitude of the hydrophobic interaction alters the adsorption mechanism through both fluid-phase transport and protein binding at the interface.","STANFORD UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305",,,"Tilton, Robert/A-8267-2009","Tilton, Robert/0000-0002-6535-9415",,,,50,94,96,2,16,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,NOV,1991.0,7.0,11,,,,,2710,2718,,10.1021/la00059a051,,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,GQ894,WOS:A1991GQ89400054,,,,,2019-02-25

These gels are highly swollen at low temperatures, gradually deswelling as temperature rises, usually sharply over a limited temperature range. Linear polymer type, crosslink density and ionic content have been varied in order to determine the effects of controllable network parameters on the important properties (degree of swelling, transition temperature and sharpness of transition) of the gels obtained. The transition temperature itself is about that of the observed linear polymer lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Producing gels from increasingly hydrophilic cellulose ethers raises the transition temperature and increases the swelling degree at comparable crosslink densities. However, decreasing crosslinking has little effect on swelling above the transition temperature. In contrast, increasing ionic content increases swelling at all temperatures. The transition temperature is not affected by the degree of crosslinking, but increases with increasing ionic content. The volume transition of the hydroxypropyl cellulose gel is significantly sharper than for the other gels. Crosslinking and ionic content have little effect on transition sharpness. The trends observed with cellulose ether gels are consistent with those observed in gels produced by conventional copolymerization/crosslinking synthesis methods, though some differences are noted.","UNIV CINCINNATI,DEPT CHEM ENGN,CINCINNATI,OH 45221",,,"Gehrke, Stevin/A-5265-2014",,,,,0,100,101,2,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-3659,,,J CONTROL RELEASE,J.

Pulpispad was highly cytotoxic to all cell lines even after setting for 1 week. The use of Pulpispad is not recommended for future clinical application. The various responses among the four cell lines indicated that diploid cell lines can, under certain circumstances, be less sensitive than aneuploid cell lines.

Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory agent, acts on macrophages to decrease production of inflammatory mediators, and on mast cells to prevent degranulation. Systemic administration of dexamethasone (dms) in rats decreases the tissue reaction to intraperitoneally implanted vinyl chloride-acrylic copolymer capsules. Local release of even smaller amounts of dms from a polymeric substrate placed inside an acrylic copolymer capsule may control the tissue reaction while avoiding the undesirable side effects of systemic treatment. Such a system also allows investigation of the local effect of soluble molecules on tissue-material interactions without altering the surface properties of the implant or adding the effect of a releasing material. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dms released from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVAc) rods placed in acrylic copolymer capsules and implanted in the peritoneal cavity of rats. In vitro the release of dms from EVAc rods was quasilinear for 5 weeks. When implanted intraperitoneally into rats, polymer capsules containing EVAc/dms rods generated a tissue reaction that was significantly thinner and featured fewer fibroblast and collagen layers than that around capsules containing pure EVAc rods at all time points studied. The tissue reaction layer was also thinner than that previously described in rats treated systemically with dms. The trabeculae of implants with dms-loaded EVAc rods contained significantly more intact mast cells than implants with EVAc alone, suggesting that degranulation of mast cells is involved in the tissue reaction to intraperitoneal polymer implants.","BROWN UNIV,ARTIFICIAL ORGAN LAB,PROVIDENCE,RI 02912",,,"Aebischer, Patrick/E-1387-2013",,,,,26,18,18,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Degradation was observed for the four polymers studied under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The rate of degradation was affected by polymer side-chain structure and correlated with the swelling behavior. The ethyl side-chain polymers absorbed more water than their phenyl counterparts. Among the sterilization methods, UV irradiation followed by antibiotic treatment was the most suitable, as steam autoclave and ethylene oxide treatments altered the properties of several of the poly(phosphoesters). Tissue response to the poly(phosphoesters) in rabbits was characterized by minor encapsulation and slight or no lymphocyte, giant cell, or macrophage activity. No evidence of edema or necrosis was found. The elastic moduli of these materials varied from 488 MPa for poly(bisphenol A-ethylphosphate) (BPA/EOP) to 627 MPa for the more rigid poly(bisphenol A-phenylphosphonate) (BPA/PP).

The measurements were repeated on the phases formed by the polymer solutions after they were mixed and allowed to equilibrate. The molecular weight distribution of the Dx differed in the top and bottom phase; both differed from that of the stock solution. Although we believe that the molecular weight distribution for PEG also differs in the top and bottom phases, we were unable to determine this within the resolution of our instruments.","HEINRICH HEINE UNIV DUSSELDORF,INST ENZYMTECHNOL,W-5170 JULICH,GERMANY",,,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [1 RO 1-GM40023-02],,,14,10,10,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1656,,,J BIOTECHNOL,J.

When partially cationized cellulose was used under suitable conditions for heparin enrichment and additionally four different crosslinking reagents and different reaction steps were applied and compared with non-cationized cellulose, the ionic fixation of heparin was ten to fifty times higher compared with non-cationized cellulose. When tested with blood partially cationized cellulose showed a high platelet adhesion whereas endothelial-cell-surface-heparansulfate (ES-HS), isolated from bovine aorta and immobilized on partially cationized cellulose, was completely inert to platelet adhesion measured in a modified Baumgartner chamber. The latter result seems to give a new promising concept for the synthesis of biomaterials, e.g. membranes with nonthrombogenic surfaces similar to surfaces of blood vessels in nature because the isolation procedure of ES-HS and immobilization of ES-HS on polymer surfaces does not change the inertness of ES-HS to platelet adhesion.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, CHEM & PATHOBIOCHEM KLIN, W-5100 AACHEN, GERMANY","BAUMANN, H (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, WORRINGERWEG 1, W-5100 AACHEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,42,13,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Direct quantitative methods utilise either measurements of the physical characteristics of the coated surface (equipment necessary for this is not always available), or measurements of radiolabelled protein. We demonstrate that proteins labelled with I-125 using chloramine-T contain a significant proportion of I-125 label which is unable to adsorb to polyvinyl microtitre wells. This non-bindable label is not separable from protein by fractionation on Sephadex G-25 but does dissociate upon SDS gel electrophoresis. The proportion of non-adsorbable label increases with storage time at -70-degrees-C, the effect being accelerated at higher temperatures. A method is described for estimating protein adsorption which is both independent of the non adsorbable fraction but can also be used to estimate it. The use of biotin as a protein label does not apparently result in deterioration of adsorption with short storage times.

However, serum incubated with silver and nickel powder stimulated neutrophils to polarize indicating that these powders may activate complement.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,INST MED & DENT BIOENGN,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,24,12,12,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,AUG,1991.0,12.0,6,,,,,607,613,,10.1016/0142-9612(91)90060-N,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,GA674,WOS:A1991GA67400015,1772960.0,,,,2019-02-25

Two fluorescent dyes of particular value for vital fluorescence studies are Rhodamine-123 and 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL). We examined the toxicity of these two dyes and of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent used in Rhodamine-123 studies, on the growth of MRC5 human fetal fibroblasts in monolayer culture. Two parameters of cell growth were quantitated: Cell number (a measure of proliferation), and cell area (a measure of cell spreading), based on microscopic images obtained at the start and end of a 48-h growth period after brief exposure (0.5 h) to test solutions. We found that the recommended solvent for solubilization of Rhodamine-123, DMSO, caused cessation of cell proliferation and actual reduction in the area covered by adherent fibroblasts at concentrations of as low as 0.1% (vol:vol). Rhodamine-123 made up from an aqueous stock solution modestly retarded proliferation and spreading, and there was no significant effect of DiI-LDL on these parameters over prolonged periods of exposure (up to 24 h) in culture. These results demonstrate that the most toxic substance for growing fibroblasts was the solvent DMSO. We conclude that both the solvent vehicle and fluorescent dye should be carefully examined for potential toxicity before such dyes are used for vital fluorescence studies of living cells.","BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT PATHOL,75 FRANCIS ST,BOSTON,MA 02115; BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02115",,,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [DK-39512]; NCRR NIH HHS [BRSG 807 RR05950],,,31,17,17,0,2,SOC IN VITRO BIOLOGY,COLUMBIA,"8815 CENTRE PARK DRIVE SUITE 210, COLUMBIA, MD 21045",0073-5655,,,IN VITRO CELL DEV B,,AUG,1991.0,27.0,8,,,,,633,638,,,,,,6,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,GG585,WOS:A1991GG58500008,1917780.0,,,,2019-02-25

Other prostheses composed of tissue-derived and polymeric biomaterials also are complicated by deposition of mineral. We have previously demonstrated that: (a) Failure due to calcification of clinical bioprosthetic valves can be simulated by either a large animal circulatory model or subdermal implants in rodents. (b) Calcification of bioprosthetic tissue has complex host, implant, and mechanical determinants. (c) The initial calcification event in the rat subdermal model is the mineral deposition in devitalized cells intrinsic to the bioprosthetic tissue within 48 to 72 h, followed later by collagen mineralization. (d) Initiation of bioprosthetic tissue mineralization, like that of physiological bone formation, has ""matrix vesicles"" as early nucleation sites. (e) Alkaline phosphatase (AP), an enzyme also associated with matrix vesicles involved in bone mineral nucleation, is present in both fresh and fixed bioprosthetic tissue at sites of initial mineralization. (f) Certain inhibitors of bioprosthetic tissue calcification (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+) are localized to the sites at which alkaline phosphatase is present. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that alkaline phosphatase is a key element in the pathogenesis of mineralization of bioprosthetic tissue. In the present studies, we focused on the relationship of AP to early events in calcification, and the inhibition of both calcification and AP activity by FeCl3 and AlCl3 preincubations. Subdermal implants of glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium (GPBP) were done in 3-week-old rats. AP was characterized by enzymatic hydrolysis of paranitrophenyl phosphate (pnpp), and by histochemical studies. Calcification was evaluated chemically (by atomic adsorption spectroscopy) and morphologically (by light microscopy). The results of these studies are as follows: (a) Extractable AP activity is present in fresh but not glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardial tissue. However, histochemical studies reveal active AP within the intrinsic devitalized cells of GPBP, despite extended glutaraldehyde incubation. (b) Extrinsic AP is rapidly adsorbed following implantation, with peak activity at 72 h (424 +/- 67.2 nm pnpp/mg protein/ min enzyme activity [units]), but markedly lesser amounts at 21 days (96.8 +/- 3.9 units). (c) Simultaneously to the AP activity maximum, bulk calcification is initiated, with GPBP calcium levels rising from 1.2 +/- 0.1 (unimplanted) to 2.4 +/-0.2-mu-g/mg at 72 h, to 55.6 +/- 3.1-mu-g/mg at 21 days, despite a marked decline in AP activity at this later time. (d) Preincubation of GPBP in either FeCl3 or AlCl3, at concentrations (0.1 M) which inhibited GPBP calcification, significantly reduce AP activity. We conclude that endogenous AP activity is present but not extractable in unimplanted GPBP fixed for extended periods. However, concurrent with the time of the onset of GPBP calcification in the rat subdermal model, AP adsorbed following implantation rises sharply to a maximum, thereby augmenting intrinsic enzyme. Preincubations of GPBP in either AlCl3 or FeCl3 not only prevent calcification, but also result in reduction in AP activity. These results strongly suggest that AP is an important cofactor in the mechanism of bioprosthetic valve mineralization and may be a fruitful target for anticalcification treatments.","BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT PATHOL,BOSTON,MA 02115; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115","LEVY, RJ (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT PEDIAT,R5014 KRESGE IT 0576,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",,,,,,,83,67,71,0,5,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

For the system poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-dextran-water these novel physical pictures are based on the observation that a transition occurs in the nature of the top PEO-rich phase, from the dilute to the semidilute polymer solution regimes, with increasing PEO molecular weight. In systems containing low molecular weight PEO (M < 10 000 Da), individual polymer coils, which may be larger or smaller than the proteins, interact with the proteins. Mathematically simple geometric and scaling arguments are used to probe the qualitative form of the free-energy change arising from polymer-protein and polymer-polymer interactions within each picture. Through a statistical thermodynamic framework, used to relate the change in free energy to the experimentally measurable protein partition coefficient, K(p), it is possible to discriminate between the novel physical pictures on the basis of the predicted qualitative trends. At THETA-solvent conditions for the polymer, a picture that incorporates solely the excluded-volume interactions between the proteins and the polymer coils is unable to account for the influence of polymer molecular weight on K(p); at athermal-solvent conditions, where repulsive polymer-polymer interactions also influence the protein chemical potential, the predicted protein partition coefficient is shifted in a direction qualitatively consistent with experimental trends. For both athermal- and THETA-solvent conditions, the observed change in K(p) is found to be qualitatively consistent with the presence of a weak attraction between the polymer coils and the proteins. The presence of a strong attraction between the polymer coils and the proteins, and associated formation of an adsorbed polymer layer at the surface of the proteins, can lead to a new partitioning behavior that has not yet been realized experimentally. In systems containing high molecular weight PEO (M >> 10 000 Da), the proteins interact with an entangled polymer network rather than with identifiable polymer coils, and the protein partition coefficient becomes independent of the PEO molecular weight.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,,,,,,73,84,86,1,21,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 22,1991.0,24.0,15,,,,,4334,4348,,10.1021/ma00015a015,,,,15,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FY047,WOS:A1991FY04700015,,,,,2019-02-25

Furthermore it is possible to both quantitatively evaluate by counting absolute cell numbers and to qualitatively evaluate by studying cell morphology with light- and/or electron microscopy.

Using our test system, both primary and secondary cytotoxic effects were found. Primary cytotoxicity is due to direct leakage of products from the material, detected by testing, extracts of the collagen or the collagen itself. Secondary cytotoxicity is due to release of cytotoxic products resulting from cell-biomaterial interactions. We conclude that our test system is extremely useful to test materials which are suspected of primary and/or secondary cytotoxicity, either with slow release of cytotoxic products or release of products with late cytotoxic effects.",,"VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,0,25,25,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The present study evaluates the effect of an atherogenic diet on macrophage/biomaterial interactions. Female New Zealand white rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from these as well as rabbits fed a normal diet and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium with platelet-poor serum. Dacron or polyglactin 910 were added to two of three conditions of both cell groups in passage 2. Conditioned media were collected weekly through week 15. Mitogenicity assays were performed with quiescent mouse embryonal (BALB/c3T3) fibroblasts, atherosclerotic rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells, and murine capillary lung (LE-II) endothelial cells. Mitogenic activity was assayed by scintillation counting of tritiated thymidine incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Results showed increased mitogenic activity released by macrophages from atherosclerotic rabbits, in the absence of prosthetic material, when assayed against every cell line. In normal diet macrophages, polyglactin 910 stimulated mitogen release for every cell line, and Dacron yielded minimal mitogen release. In lipid diet macrophages polyglactin 910 slightly increased mitogen release for all three cell lines, whereas Dacron resulted in stimulation of DNA synthesis in smooth muscle cells and BALB/c3T3 cells but less DNA synthesis in LE-II cells than in control, no graft material, media. Western blotting demonstrated immunoreactivity to basic fibroblast growth factor in media from normal diet macrophages but only in the presence of polyglactin 910 or Dacron. Radioimmunoassay for platelet-derived growth factor B chain was negative in all groups, and polymerase chain reaction techniques to amplify transforming growth factor-beta messenger ribonucleic was negative. These data demonstrate the effect of in vivo dietary manipulation on macrophage activation as well as the effect of an atherogenic diet in modulating macrophage/biomaterial interactions. Additionally, different biomaterials differentially induce macrophages to release factors that stimulate and inhibit growth.","VET ADM MED CTR,HINES,IL 60141; ST BARNABAS HOSP,LIVINGSTON,NJ 07039; AMER RED CROSS,ROCKVILLE,MD","GREISLER, HP (reprint author), LOYOLA UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT SURG,2160 S 1ST AVE,MAYWOOD,IL 60153, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL41272],,,28,14,15,0,0,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

The reply rates were about 80% and 83%. In both surveys, about one half of the personnel reported occupation-related health complaints, a majority of which were dermatoses of hands and fingers. The dermatoses were attributed to seasonal air quality problems, or to contact with chemically active substances relevant to hygienic measures, treatment patterns, or other activities connected with the running of a dental clinic. The majority of the dermatoses were probably irritative. Some presumably hypersensitivity reactions occurred after handling of dental materials. Latex gloves, which were in general use only at the time of the last survey, seemed to have prevented some dermatoses formerly attributed to handwashing procedures. However, latex gloves per se had also induced dermatoses. Non-dermatological ailments of a transient nature comprised eye, respiratory, or systemic reactions and were connected with volatiles from X-ray liquids, methylmethacrylate monomer, and disinfectants. Adverse patient reactions occurred at a frequency of about one per 2600 treated patients. The observations comprised skin reactions (head/face), gingival/mucosal ulcerations, and sometimes systemic/urticarial reactions. The reactions were associated with the use of local anesthetics, orthodontic appliances, and other biomaterials. Two reactions were related to contact with the dentists' latex gloves.","OSLO PUBL DENT HLTH SERV,OSLO,NORWAY","JACOBSEN, N (reprint author), SCANDINAVIAN INST DENT MAT,NIOM,N-1344 HASLUM,NORWAY.",,,,,,,25,44,44,1,1,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0301-5661,,,COMMUNITY DENT ORAL,Community Dentist.

Beginning as a research thrust, which led to courses at a few universities, biomaterials education has evolved into distinct curriculum in over 60 institutions in the United States and Canada alone. Rapid growth, however, can cause problems. In an effort to determine the present status and future needs in each sector, as well as begin to assess if the needs of industry are being met by present academic programs, two surveys were sent out. As shown by the two surveys, academic programs have been increasing in both size and quality while industry has also been expanding, as indicated by the many small companies involved in biomaterials. The shift toward graduate programs is in keeping with the perceived educational needs of potential employers. The majority of academic programs appear to be providing the training and coursework desired by employers. Further information, however, is needed to determine if the number of graduates trained in biomaterials is adequate, or in fact excessive. It is, therefore, recommended that a more comprehensive survey, sent to the biomaterials companies listed in the FDA registry, be undertaken. In addition, a survey to each academic program that addresses hiring of recent graduates would also be beneficial. It does appear that certain standards for curricula could be agreed upon, although the field has probably not evolved sufficiently for accreditation or professional registration to be addressed yet.","ONCOGEN,SEATTLE,WA","FELDMAN, DS (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA,SCH ENGN,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,BUSINESS ENGN COMPLEX,ROOM 256,UAB STN,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294, USA.",,,,,,,4,3,3,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",1045-4861,,,J APPL BIOMATER,J.

Radiolabelled bacteria (10(8) cfu/ml) were incubated in vials containing 1-cm lengths of catheter for up to 3 days. The peak of maximal adherence to each biomaterial was reached after 24 h for P. aeruginosa and after 72 h for the other strains. Bacterial adherence to PVC and siliconised latex was significantly higher (2-6 times; p < 0.05) than to the other biomaterials for all the strains. The lowest values of adherence were observed with polyurethane and Vialon(R) for the staphylococci but with Teflon(R) for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. None of the eluates affected the viability of the staphylococci. However, all of them, significantly increased the growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa with the exception of the eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced to an undetectable level for E. coli. We conclude that bacterial adherence to catheters may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that certain substances eluted from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different micro-organisms.","UNIV SEVILLE,SCH MED,DEPT MICROBIOL,APDO 914,E-41080 SEVILLE,SPAIN",,,"Pascual, Alvaro/Y-5854-2018","Pascual, Alvaro/0000-0002-8672-5891",,,,13,55,57,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0022-2615,,,J MED MICROBIOL,J.

The PU-FBNG material was processed through a spraying, phase-inversion technique to fabricate porous tubular conduits. FBNG was subsequently converted into covalently cross-linked fibrin (FBN) through the action of thrombin (Th), fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF), and calcium ions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the cross-linked blend was more stable than native cross-linked FBN. Tensile behaviors of the PU-FBN materials closely matched those of a natural artery on varying the ratio PU/FBN. Implantation experiments in the rat model showed a mature internal capsule and good tissue organization of PU-FBN (50%) grafts in the regenerated arterial wall. However, 50% of FBN did not assure adequate mechanical resistance, and aneurysmal changes were seen in some grafts.

Many of these complications are caused by the intrinsic thrombogenicity of the biomaterials, which are used to cast the luminal blood sac. Numerous attempts have been made to improve the hemocompatibility of the new generation of totally implantable blood pumps, mainly by physico-chemical modifications of the biopolymeric materials and the blood contacting surfaces. We, on the other hand, believe that the most promising and challenging approach, from both the biologists' and engineers' point of view, is to coat the luminal surfaces of cardiac prostheses with a functional monolayer of autologous endothelial cells (ECs) and thus reproduce ""nature's biocompatible blood container."" The key to lining an artificial heart with a nonthrombogenic monolayer of endothelial cells is to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms which render the EC lining inside the beating ventricle nonthrombogenic and resistant to flow-induced shear stresses and cyclic, tensional deformations. This knowledge has then to be translated into biotechnological know-how, in order to maintain an intact EC monolayer inside the blood sac of an artificial device. In this paper we emphasize some of the bioengineering issues associated with the endothelialization of the luminal sac, and also discuss some aspects related to the blood sac itself.","UNIV WISCONSIN, SCH MED, DEPT MED, CELL BIOL LAB, MILWAUKEE, WI 53201 USA",,,,,,,,93,9,9,0,1,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

Upon heating to about 300-350-degrees-C, 7 spontaneously rearranged to poly(Bisphenol A N-phenylurethane) (4). The rearrangement was a first-order reaction with an activation energy of 180 kJ/mol. The transformation of 7 to 4 was followed by FT-IR. Analysis of the polymer before and after heat treatment by gel permeation chromatography and low-angle laser light scattering indicated that the rearrangement proceeded without detectable backbone cleavage. The chemical structure of 4 was confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR. This polymer formed transparent, amorphous, and mechanically strong films (tensile strength, 567 kg/cm2; tensile modulus, 23,800 kg/cm2; elongation at break, 5.5%).

The onset of the decomposition exotherm was observed at 475-degrees-C (DSC, in air, open pan), and the polymer started to lose weight at 504-degrees-C (TGA, in air). Since N-substituted polyurethanes cannot be readily obtained by conventional polymerization reactions, the exceptionally clean, thermal rearrangement of 7 to 4 represents a rare case of a synthetically useful, polymeric backbone rearrangement.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,APR 29,1991.0,24.0,9,,,,,2302,2308,,10.1021/ma00009a028,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FJ881,WOS:A1991FJ88100028,,,,,2019-02-25

To prevent this condition an interlocked running suture to adjust the mesh is recommended. It is concluded that this intestinal sling procedure is a feasible surgical method causing only mild postoperative complaints or no symptoms at all.

The integrated Py-FI mass spectra give characteristic fingerprints of the biomaterials investigated. The application of principal component analysis to the mass spectral data results in a clear discrimination and classification of the samples reflecting the chemical modifications and transformations of organic matter by biochemical and biogeochemical processes. The chemical compositions are determined by processes such as enrichment and/or translocation of plant constituents (e.g. carbohydrates, lignin, lipids, suberin, and aliphatic polymers) during maturation and senescence of needles; amendment of new components; decomposition; selective preservation and humification processes in the soil environment. During needle maturation, major chemical changes include the decrease of carbohydrate content, condensation of lignin, and crosslinking of waves. Senescent needles are characterized by lower contents of carbohydrates and lower yields of monomeric pyrolysis products from lignin. The contribution of different litter materials to the humus layer can be estimated by differences in chemical composition. During litter decomposition and humification on the forest floor, carbohydrate content decreases rapidly. The lignin content remains almost constant but some subunits are continuously oxidized. Wax material accumulates until the mechanical disintegration of the needle occurs. In the O-horizons polymeric aliphatic materials are enriched in humified plant remains. A constant increase of aryl-alkyl esters from suberin in the O-horizons is due to both root input and selective preservation. In general, mainly aliphatic polymers and aryl-alkyl esters accumulate during the genesis of mor profiles under conifers.",,"HEMPFLING, R (reprint author), FACHHSCH FRESENIUS WIESBADEN,DEPT TRACE ANAL,DAMBACHTAL 20,W-6200 WIESBADEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,37,36,36,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-2563,,,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,Biogeochemistry,APR,1991.0,13.0,1,,,,,27,60,,,,,,34,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,FZ495,WOS:A1991FZ49500002,,,,,2019-02-25

To test an existing model for its usefulness in quantitative evaluation of periodontal wound healing, large supraalveolar periodontal defects were surgically created around the mandibular premolars (P2, P3, P4) in the left or right jaw quadrants in 5 beagle dogs. The defects were exposed to the oral environment for 6 months and were then subjected to reconstructive flap surgery (chronic defects). Healing in these defects was compared to healing following reconstructive surgery in similar contralateral defects which had not been exposed to plaque and calculus (acute defects). The animals were sacrificed after a 4-week healing period and tissue blocks including teeth and surrounding structures were processed for histometric analysis. Mean defect height (+/- s.d) for chronic and acute defects amounted to 4.6 +/- 0.3 and 4.4 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. Mean connective tissue repair to the root surface in chronic defects amounted to 62% (range 49% to 74%) of the defect height. Mean connective tissue repair in the acute defects exceeded 94% of the defect height in 4 of the dogs, but amounted to only 48% in 1 dog. Regeneration of alveolar bone and cementum was limited under both experimental conditions. Root resorption was frequently encountered, whereas ankylosis was seen in only few teeth. This study indicates that healing may vary not only as a result of controlled experimental variables, but also due to differences in biological response between dogs or to fortuitous traumatic factors. The variability in healing in the chronic defects imposes limitations on the use of this defect model to study periodontal regeneration, especially when a small number of animals is used.","NATL DENTAL HLTH SERV, KRISTIANSTAD, SWEDEN; UNIV BERGEN, N-5014 BERGEN, NORWAY","WIKESJO, UME (reprint author), LOMA LINDA UNIV, SCH DENT, LOMA LINDA, CA 92350 USA.",,"Wikesjo, Ulf/A-4159-2009","Wikesjo, Ulf/0000-0003-1607-0583",,,,38,35,35,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-3492,1943-3670,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

To investigate the growth characteristics of endothelial cells on theoretically suitable biomaterials, we compared three polyurethanes (Pellethane, Biomer, Enka) and three silicone rubbers (Elastosil, 3145 RTV, Medical Adhesive). All synthetic surfaces were precoated with an extracellular matrix (group 1), fibronectin (group 2), or a glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix (group 3). After the seeding of 2.5 X 10(4)/cm2 human endothelial cells onto the various surfaces, primary adherence, growth kinetics, and maintenance of monolayer integrity were studied for 13 days. On the three polyurethanes all precoating procedures resulted in endothelial cell proliferation and the formation of persistent monolayers. In contrast, on silicone rubbers a persistent coverage with a confluent endothelium could be achieved only on the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix. When endothelial cell growth was quantitatively assessed on all precoating substrates, the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix proved to be far superior on each of the synthetics (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of endothelialization of artificial hearts in vitro. Provided such an endothelium can withstand the mechanical forces within an artificial heart, in vitro endothelialization might contribute to a regained attractiveness of the elective long-term implantation of artificial hearts.","UNIV VIENNA,DEPT SURG 2,A-1010 VIENNA,AUSTRIA; UNIV FREIBURG,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,W-7800 FREIBURG,GERMANY; UNIV CAPE TOWN,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,CAPE TOWN,SOUTH AFRICA",,,,,,,,28,11,11,0,1,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-5223,,,J THORAC CARDIOV SUR,J.

To understand this, a computer simulation of stress in a PFM strip was conducted. The simulation considers cooling from temperatures higher than the porcelain sag point. The following temperature-dependent factors were incorporated : the elastic modulus, shear viscosity (porcelain), and coefficient of thermal expansion. Cooling rates during tempering of porcelain were measured. The cooling rate dependencies of the glass transition temperature and temperature distribution during cooling were also included in the simulation.

Discs of hexamethylenediisocyanate-tanned dermal sheep collagen were subcutaneously implanted in rats. Both an intra- and an extracellular route of degradation could be distinguished. In addition to normal components of a typical foreign body reaction, remarkable phenomena, such as locally deviant neutrophil morphology, infiltration of basophil-like cells, indications of foreign body multinucleate giant cells formed from different cell types, aluminium silicate accumulations and calcium phosphate depositions, were observed. Foreign body multinucleate giant cells intracellularly degraded hexamethylenediisocyanate-tanned dermal sheep collagen after internalization. Both internalized and cellularly enveloped hexamethylenediisocyanate-tanned dermal sheep collagen degraded by the detachment of fibrils. Another extracellular route of degradation was characterized by calcium phosphate depositions in large bundles of hexamethylenediisocyanate-tanned dermal sheep collagen. From 6 wk, the hexamethylenediisocyanate-tanned dermal sheep collagen implant was replaced by rat connective tissue, which was subsequently also degraded. After 15 wk, the presence of basophil-like foreign body multinucleated giant cells containing aluminium/silicon-crystalline accumulations still persisted.

According to this criterion, biomaterials such as hemodialysis membranes made from cellulosic or various synthetic polymers were classified as activators or nonactivators of complement. Since certain membranes bind large quantities of C3a from the fluid phase, classification based on fluid-phase C3a concentration has in some instances been inaccurate. As follows from the comparison of complement activation by cuprophane and polyacrylonitrile membranes, the capacity of a biomedical polymer to activate complement is not determined by the number of potential covalent binding sites on its surface. Biomaterial itself may lack hydroxyl and/or amino groups, and yet it may activate C3 in human serum very efficiently. Some of the biomaterials may also bind unactivated/unfragmented C3 whether in the absence or presence of other serum proteins. In addition, binding of factor B (a promotor of C3 activation) and binding of factor H (an inhibitor of C3 activation) to certain biomaterials have been found to be independent of complement activation and unaffected by the presence or absence of C3. Thus, it is becoming apparent that the requirements for the formation and stability of the C3 convertase on artificial surfaces differ from those on biological membranes, and that the relative magnitude of binding of factor B and factor H to the surface per se cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the capacity of the biomaterial to activate complement. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of C3 and C5 activation on the surfaces of biomedical polymers. Its understanding should lead to the development of new or modification of existing artificial membranes which would cause less adverse effects for patients during extracorporeal procedures.",,"JANATOVA, J (reprint author), UNIV UTAH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,50 N MED DR,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84132, USA.",,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [DK 35830]; NIAID NIH HHS [AI 19319],,,0,56,56,0,6,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1012-8204,,,COMPLEMENT INFLAMMAT,,MAR-APR,1991.0,8.0,2,,,,,61,69,,10.1159/000463181,,,,9,Immunology,Immunology,FF582,WOS:A1991FF58200001,2055009.0,,,,2019-02-25

Acetone and ethanol immersion produced 98.9% and 94.3% denucleation, respectively. Denucleation was essentially complete when vacuum exposure was followed by hydrostatic pressure treatment at 500 psig or greater. The influence of gas content on thrombogenicity was determined by immersing graft samples in whole canine blood and weighing the adherent thrombus. Denucleation significantly reduced adherent thrombus weight compared with control grafts (p < 0.001). Air in Vitagraft walls was responsible for 84% of the adherent thrombus weight at four minutes.

When the DDS-glass was coated with albumin alone, platelets were only contact adherent and could not spread at all. After competitive adsorption of fibrinogen and albumin, however, platelets were able to spread on the surface. Platelet activation increased linearly as the surface fibrinogen concentration increased up to 0.02-mu-g/cm2. Platelets were able to activate fully if the surface fibrinogen concentration was 0.02-mu-g/cm2 or higher, even though the surface was dominated by albumin.

While methyl methacrylate and 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate were found nontoxic, the other chemicals displayed high cytotoxicity. However, when extracts of synthesized poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) specimens, differentially treated after polymerization, were subjected to the same assays it was found that toxicity from residual 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate monomer was lost during steam sterilization and storage in water because of the removal of the monomer through aqueous washing.

The patency rate of composite grafts was not significantly different from that of isotopic vein (p = 0.5, Fisher's exact test), and both had higher patency than unprocessed polyurethane (p < 0.01). Composite grafts were examined sequentially using light and scanning electron microscopy. Grafts were fully endothelialized between the first and third months.

Immobilization of 2.75 +/- 0.45-mu-g rHir on 1.0 cm2 Dacron prosthetic graft patches resulted in inhibition of 1.88 +/- 0.03-mu-g alpha-thrombin in solution (mean +/- SD, n = 3), which is a 8:1 molar ratio, respectively. rHir ED50 inhibition of 0.1 NIH U alpha thrombin stimulated whole blood platelet aggregation was 0.12 x 10(-6)-mu-M. The conjugate ED50 inhibition was 1.37 x 10(-6)-mu-M showing an eleven-fold loss of activity. We conclude that there is only a ten-fold loss of inhibitory activity when rHir is covalently immobilized and that this technique has a benefit of localizing antithrombin activity to surfaces or soluble carrier molecules.","HARVARD UNIV,NEW ENGLAND DEACONESS HOSP,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02215",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R0-1 HL21796],,,15,11,11,1,1,RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH",0957-5235,,,BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN,Blood Coagul.

Tiny air nuclei (microbubbles) are found in the surface roughness of biomaterials on exposure to a liquid, therefore two interfaces exist: (a) a blood/biomaterial, and (b) a blood/air interface. Experiments were carried out that documented that air bubbles activate complement and augment in vitro platelet aggregation in human plasma. The air nuclei were removed from the surface of silicone rubber by a technique termed denucleation to determine if complement activation and platelet aggregation could be reduced. We observed a significant reduction in C3a and C5a in the plasma samples incubated with denucleated silicone rubber as compared to the control samples (p < 0.001, ANOVA). The plasma incubated with the denucleated silicone caused reduced platelet aggregation as compared to the plasma incubated with the control silicone when added to a platelet suspension (p < 0.001, ANOVA).

This approach was used to provide substrates that were adhesive to cells even in the absence of serum proteins and with no prior pretreatment of the surface with proteins of the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) family. This approach was used to dramatically enhance the cell-adhesiveness of substrates that were otherwise cell-nonadhesive and to improve control of cellular interactions with cell-adhesive materials by providing stably bound adhesion ligands. Glycophase glass was examined as a model cell-nonadhesive substrate prior to modification, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were examined as representative materials for biomedical applications. The peptides were surface-coupled by their N-terminal amine to surface hydroxyl moieties using tresyl chloride chemistry. Prior to peptide grafting, the PET and PTFE were surface hydroxylated to yield PETOH and PTFE-OH. The PET-OH was less cell-adhesive and the PTFE-OH was much more cell-adhesive than the native polymers. Radioiodination of a C-terminal tyrosine residue was used to quantify the amount of peptide coupled to the surface, and these amounts were 12.1 pmol/cm2 on glycophase glass, 139 fmol/cm2 on PETOH, and 31 fmol/cm2 on PTFE-OH. Although the glycophase glass did not support adhesion or spreading even in the presence of serum, the RGD- and YIGSR-grafted glycophase glass did support adhesion and spreading, even when the only serum protein that was included was albumin. Although PET and PTFE-OH supported adhesion when incubated in serum-supplemented medium, neither of these materials supported adhesion with only albumin present, indicating that cell adhesion is mediated by adsorbed CAM proteins. When these materials were peptide-grafted, however, extensive adhesion and spreading did occur even when only albumin was present. Since the peptide grafting is quite easily controlled and is temporally stable, while protein adsorption is quite difficult to precisely control and is temporally dynamic, peptide grafting may be advantageous over other approaches employed to improve long-term cell adhesion to biomaterials.","UNIV TEXAS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,AUSTIN,TX 78712",,,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",,,,26,234,239,0,44,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The syntheses were accomplished by the following sequence of reactions. First, the sodium salt of diacetone D-glucose or the cosubstituent nucleophile was allowed to react with poly(dichlorophosphazene) to generate an intermediate of formula [NP(di-A-Gl)(x)Cl(y)]n or [NPCl(x)(OR)y]n, with the ratio of x to y being determined by the ratio of the reactants. Second, the cosubstituent (NHR, OR, or di-A-Gl) was introduced by replacement of the remaining chlorine by reaction with methylamine or the appropriate alkoxide or aryl oxide. Finally, the protecting groups on the glucosyl residues were removed by treatment with acid. A wide range of ratios of x to y was explored, and the resultant polymers were studied with respect to solubility in water, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, cross-linking by gamma-radiation or chemical reagents, and stability to hydrolysis.

In order to minimise the cell adhesion and other type of depositions, a method of surface modification of lens involving the use of phosphoryl choline, a phospholipid and the glow discharge technique has been described. The power variation of the lenses after modification has been checked using Topcon lensometer. The possible power changes of the modified samples due to the exposure to the normal light in the laboratory, darkness, ultraviolet (U.V.) light or saline have been investigated by taking the visible and ultra violet spectra using Beckman spectrophotometer. Surface energy variations after modifications of the samples have been checked by sessile drop water contact angle measurements. Glow discharge treatment increases the hydrophilicity of the samples.

Observations of the internal substructure were distorted. The open face of the fibers were frequently covered with debris. Conversely, when fibers were frozen and then fractured, dehydrated fibers appeared to have undistorted features and were intact around their edges. No contamination across the face of the fiber was apparent and there was no difference in morphology between the nitrogen and Freon frozen dehydrated collagen fibers. Transmission electron microscopy showed that collagen fibers were composed of a subpopulation of transverse and longitudinal collagen fibrils and fibril bundles embedded in a disorganized amorphous collagen matrix. Freeze fracturing or snapping collagenous biomaterials was shown to be an effective method for retaining the substructure of these dry and very fragile materials.

We have identified proteins expressed on the surfaces of retrieved vascular grafts to determine if certain proteins were present at the end stage of vascular failure. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of protein adsorption on the surfaces of retrieved vascular prostheses was determined using antibodies to human blood proteins fibrinogen, fibronectin, Hageman factor (factor XII and factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor. The detection of these proteins on the blood contacting surface was evaluated by immunogold labelling with protein A-gold beads followed by silver enhancement. Fibronectin was the most abundant protein detected on retrieved expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or umbilical vein grafts. Protein adsorption was disperse for all proteins and one protein, fibronectin, was found in great amounts on all surfaces. Proteins such as fibronectin may be important in the adhesion and activation of platelets and leukocytes and thus contribute to the development of thrombosis.

The application of these procedures resulted in a versatile, low toxicity GMA embedding medium. GMA embedding medium and resin blocks were tested utilizing a variety of physico-chemical techniques, namely: gas chromatography, determination of the maximum temperature reached during polymerization, the time taken to reach the maximum temperature, hardness testing, determination of the glass transition temperature, and measurement of the dimensional changes following section stretching and mounting at various temperatures. Data obtained from these techniques enabled a multi-purpose GMA embedding medium to be precisely specified. The infiltration solution, as well as the accelerator solution, of this mixture contains fewer toxic components than comparable systems. The infiltration solution consists of GMA monomer and a non-toxic plasticizer (2-isopropoxy ethanol). The initiator is a 50% damped dibenzoyl peroxide, and the accelerator solution is composed of a mixture of polyethylene glycol 200 and a low concentration of a low toxicity tertiary amine (N,N,3,5-tetramethylaniline). Resin blocks obtained from this mixture are highly transparent, do not become coloured, and are easy to cut at 0.5-2.0-mu-m. Various histological techniques, such as routine embedding of implanted biomaterials, histochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry were carried out; the new GMA embedding medium proved to be applicable in all the techniques without laborious modifications.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT PATHOL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS; HERAEUS KULZER GMBH,W-6393 WEHRHEIM,GERMANY; UNIV SHEFFIELD,DEPT BIOMED SCI,SHEFFIELD S10 2TN,S YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND","GERRITS, PO (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT ANAT & EMBRYOL,69 OOSTERSINGEL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,29,11,11,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,189,198,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300001,,,,,2019-02-25

Ruthenium red-lysine preserved considerable amounts of slime covering the cocci as well as extending between them and the prosthetic surface. Elongate strands of slime appeared to facilitate attachment to the substrate and projection of cells away from the substrate.

To gain more insight in the relation between basophil-like cells, foreign body multinucleate giant (FBM-G) cells derived from them, and aluminum/silicate (Al/Si)-crystals, we also implanted agarose-embedded Al/Si-crystals. GDSC induced early after implantation extensive lipid formation, cell degeneration and death, but NDSC did not have any cytotoxic effects. Basophil-like (FBM-G) cells specifically dealt with Al/Si-crystals, because they were attracted by the agarose-embedded Al/Si-crystals. These cells were also attracted by GDSC and NDSC, where Al/Si-crystals are present. Accumulation of Al/Si-crystals was especially prominent with GDSC. Degradation by phagocytosis was in part carried out by FBM-G cells, derived from macrophages or fibroblasts, and observed only with GDSC, which indicates that the presence of cross-links is a prerequisite for their formation.","TWENTE UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT CHEM TECHNOL,7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS","VANWACHEM, PB (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,BIOMAT RES SECT,OOSTERSINGEL 692,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,48,19,19,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,251,263,,,,,,13,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300007,,,,,2019-02-25

Matrix vesicle (MV) numbers, diameters, distances to calcifying fronts, and numbers of MV-types were recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and histomorphometry. Implants were surrounded by time-dependent and implant-dependent primary calcification. The bonding type displayed more intratibial bone than the non-bonding type. Bone-bonding implants supported mineralization via increased MV numbers when compared to metal oxide containing non-bonding implants. High MV diameters correlated with a high osteoblastic forming capacity in both implants. The intravesicular crystal formation around bone-bonding implants was slightly delayed. At 6 days , MV distances to calcifying fronts were significantly smaller in non-bonding implants. Non-bonding implants did not affect intravesicular hydroxyapatite (HA) crystal growth significantly, which contradicts in vitro findings. They affected osteoblastic function via a reduced production of MV and extracellular matrix (ECM). Osteoblastic function and the growth of calcifying fronts might be disturbed by leached metal oxides rather than MV function.

This has led to a surge in investigations suggesting a role for hydrophobicity in adhesion of bacteria to an array of surfaces (oral surfaces, mineral particles, fatty meat, epithelial cells, phagocytes, biomaterials), partitioning at interfaces, as well as gliding mobility. The present manuscript comprises a critical, chronological look at the origins of microbial hydrophobicity research, its development, origins, and applications.

After 4 months, some small areas of ossification were observed around the HA particles. After 6 months, the fibro-connective tissue was replaced by neo-formed bone in the mandible. PFC was found to increase the interfaces between the HA particles and the host tissues, permitting HA integration into the bone. The PFC/HA implant was also molded when moistened by blood or saline solution and then became mis-shapen by local pressures exerted. These findings show that the implant should preferably be reserved for the restoration of bones not subjected to significant forces or local stresses.","UNIV LOUVAIN, HOSP MT GODINNE, DEPT PATHOL, B-5530 YVOIR, BELGIUM","REMACLE, M (reprint author), UNIV LOUVAIN, HOSP MT GODINNE, DEPT EAR NOSE & THROAT HEAD & NECK SURG, B-5530 YVOIR, BELGIUM.",,,,,,,31,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0937-4477,1434-4726,,EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L,Eur.

In vitro studies of platelet adhesion in flowing blood have become possible due to the development of suitable perfusion chambers. With the use of such chambers, adhesion to subendothelium and to isolated connective tissue components from the vessel wall has been realized. Such studies have begun to shed light on the molecular basis of the adhesion process. Von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibronectin, and collagen types I and III have been shown to be the most important adhesive proteins. The functional domains involved in vWF and fibronectin are being identified and the platelet receptors for these ligands have been established. A complicated picture of multiple mutually supportive ligand-receptor interactions has emerged. These insights are critical for the development of thrombo-resistant biomaterials.","WAKE FOREST UNIV,BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,WINSTON SALEM,NC 27103","SIXMA, JJ (reprint author), UNIV HOSP UTRECHT,DEPT HAEMATOL,G03 647,POB 85500,3508 GA UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,46,17,17,0,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The surfaces studied included polyethylene (PE), silicone rubber (SR), Teflon-FEP (FEP), and two polyetherurethanes: one with a poly(tetramethylene oxide) soft segment (PTMO-PU) and one with a poly(ethylene oxide) soft segment (PEO-PU). The adsorption of these proteins from single-component solutions followed the Freundlich isotherm and the adhesive proteins showed similar trends in Freundlich parameters for surfaces of similar surface wettability. Adsorption from a quaternary-component solution composed of physiological molar ratios of the three proteins and human serum albumin (HSA) revealed a significant enrichment of adsorbed vitronectin as determined from ratios of the adsorbed surface fraction of each protein to its respective bulk fraction. The other proteins' adsorption was enriched to a lesser extent in the decreasing order of FGN > FN > HSA for all surfaces. The relative enrichment of VN from plasma was also high as compared with its bulk concentration, whereas the enrichment of FGN, FN, and HSA was much lower and of approximately the same magnitude. Compared with the three other proteins, VN showed a resistance to displacement from the polymer substrates as either the plasma concentration was increased or the length of contact with plasma and diluted plasma was increased.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,1415 W JOHNSON DR,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-21001, HL-24046]",,,53,70,70,2,28,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In this paper attention is directed rather to the antecedent transport phenomena necessary to deliver successive proteins to a surface. The different limitations on protein arrival fixed by the total quantity present and by the rates of transport of super-sufficient quantities are distinguished. The transport perspective is then used to ask, and partly answer, the question: Can protein displacement be responsible for patterns of thrombus formation and cellular adhesion that are seen on the blood-wetted surfaces of devices found in medical practice: artificial organs and vascular prostheses?

We here report an in vitro biomechanical evaluation of a biodegradable particulate composite that might be used for similar purposes. The composite includes a matrix phase consisting of a hydrolyzable prepolymer [polypropylene fumarate (PPF)] cross-linked with methacrylate monomer, and a particulate phase consisting of tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. We implanted dynamic hip screws in 22 cadaveric proximal femora and measured the yield load for an oblique force applied to the femoral head. The hip screws were then reinforced with either PMMA or the PPF composite and tested again. On the basis of analysis of variance, the average increases in yield load for PMMA and PPF reinforcement of 1,750 and 1,130 N were statistically significant (p < 0.00005), suggesting that both materials enhance congruence between implant and bone and thereby increase the projected load-bearing area of the implant. The increase in yield force with PMMA was slightly higher than the increase with PPF (p < 0.05), but both values after reinforcement were close (3,790 +/- 561 N for PMMA vs. 3,240 +/- 669 N for PPF). If we can demonstrate that appropriate rates of degradation, bony ingrowth, and static and fatigue properties can be achieved in vivo with this system, our data suggest that this PPF composite may have potential as an adjunct to the internal fixation of unstable fractures of the osteoporotic hip.","BETH ISRAEL HOSP,CHARLES A DANA RES INST,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ORTHOPAED BIOMECH LAB,BOSTON,MA 02215; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115",,,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [CDC CR102550],,,26,24,24,0,2,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Yet commercial polymers are in general unsatisfactory biomaterials. This is due to variability in composition, stability, surface smoothness, and the presence of impurities during production. On the other hand we have already successfully demonstrated that many of the mechanical and physical properties of polymers can be substantially improved by modifications of the surface by simple ion irradiation. Ion irradiation and track etch techniques have been used in a study of the surface properties of polymeric biomaterials, including polyetheylene, and teflon. The experimental results on surface improvement - especially wear, and stability under irradiation are discussed against the theoretical background of ion ranges and energy deposition in the polymer at the atomic/molecular level. Some new and exciting potential commercial applications are briefly referred to. There are implications for all polymeric biomaterials in this most recent practical approach to modification of basic physico-chemical properties. A high added value accompanies the much improved reliability of polymeric medical applications, and a greater compatibility with human tissue.","AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV,PHYS SCI RES SCH,INST ADV STUDIES,CTR LASER PHYS,CANBERRA,ACT 2600,AUSTRALIA; HAHN MEITNER INST KERNFORSCH BERLIN GMBH,P-3,GLIENICKERSTR 100,W-1000 BERLIN 39,GERMANY; UNIV AUTONOMA METROPOLITANA AZCAPOTZALCO,DEPT FIS,IZTAPALAPA,DF,MEXICO","KOUL, SL (reprint author), AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV,CSIRO,CTR ENVIRONM MECH,GPO BOX 4,CANBERRA,ACT 2600,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,6,7,7,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0735-245X,,,NUCL TRACKS RAD MEAS,,,1991.0,19.0,1-4,,,,,825,828,,,,,,4,Nuclear Science & Technology,Nuclear Science & Technology,GP190,WOS:A1991GP19000190,,,,,2019-02-25

However, there is continuing debate in the literature regarding their long term stability in biomedical environments, and the validity of using polyurethanes for extended implant applications is still very much in question. While evidence of polymer degradation in explanted devices has been reported by a number of workers, other studies conclude that degradation is minimal. This review discusses possible pathways of biomedical degradation, such as enzymatic and oxidative attack, as well as observed effects such as cracking and calcification. Metal catalyzed degradation may also occur in devices such as pacemaker leads. While a number of model studies have assessed various modes of degradation, reliable accelerated tests for the prediction of the rates of biomedical ageing effects have apparently not been established. The role of additives and surface contaminants in biocompatibility and degradation is also discussed. Finally, as important interactions between a polyurethane polymer and the host body occur at the interface, the surface analysis of polyurethanes is discussed, and it is concluded that proper characterization of the implant surface before and after degradation studies is important for the understanding of degradation, in particular to exclude effects caused not by the polyurethane itself, but by surface contaminants which appear to have been present on the majority of materials subjected to detailed characterization so far.",,"GRIESSER, HJ (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV CHEM & POLYMERS,PRIVATE BAG 10,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA.",,"Griesser, Hans/E-5628-2011","Griesser, Hans/0000-0003-1072-7863",,,,92,62,62,4,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0141-3910,,,POLYM DEGRAD STABIL,Polym.

They are artificial kidney, artificial lung, artificial skin, artificial pancreas, and artificial cornea. The membranes in these artificial organs are mostly employed to allow the selective permeation of some substances, similar to those in industrial applications. However, biocompatibility is additionally required in the medical applications of these membranes. It is shown that coupling of poly(ethylene glycol) onto the cellulose membrane used for hemodialysis greatly improves the blood compatibility, while graft polymerization of acrylamide onto a silicone membrane used for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation largely reduces clot formation on the surface. The silicone membrane is shown to be effective also for protection of damaged skin, when used with a porous collagen sheet.

Autogenous bone, cryopreserved allograft bone, or equal parts of allograft bone and tricalcium phosphate were added to the decorticated posterior elements. A total of 27 sites were prepared for fusion. The spines were retrieved at 6 months and evaluated for integrity and stability of the fusion sites by clinical examination, three-point bending tests, multiplanar radiographs, and undecalcified tetracycline-labeled and decalcified histologic sections. The nine sites that received autogenous bone were solidly fused. There were one clinical and two radiographic nonunions in the nine sites that received cryopreserved allograft bone. Sites that received a mixture of allograft bone and tricalcium phosphate demonstrated slight motion at two locations and radiographic evidence of fusion at all levels. The extent and degree of fusion was not site-specific. Three-point bending analysis did not demonstrate a significant trend as to site or materials specificity. No adverse histologic response was noted. Histologic sections and tetracycline labels confirmed abundant new bone formation at all sites at 6 months. Although autogenous bone remains the gold standard for use in spinal arthrodesis, this study demonstrates the value of cryopreserved allograft bone alone and in combination with tricalcium phosphate in promoting spinal fusion.","UNIV ALABAMA,DIV ORTHOPAED SURG,619 S 19TH ST,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35233",,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,0,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,,1991.0,16.0,8,,S,,,S330,S333,,,,,,4,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,GB441,WOS:A1991GB44100005,1785082.0,,,,2019-02-25

In contrast, most of the existing joint prostheses operate not under fluid film but under mixed lubrication, which induces some tribological problems such as loosening and wear. Thus, recent investigations on the lubrication mechanisms in natural synovial joints and total replacement joints are reviewed, and then subjects on lubrication and wear in joint prostheses and optimum design of joint prostheses with artificial cartilage are discussed.",,"MURAKAMI, T (reprint author), KYUSHU UNIV,FAC ENGN,6-10-1 HAKOZAKI,HIGASHI KU,FUKUOKA 812,JAPAN.",,,,,,,55,53,53,1,16,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS SANSHIN HOKUSEI BLDG,TOKYO,"4-9 YOYOGI 2-CHOME SHIBUYA-KU, TOKYO 151, JAPAN",0914-8825,,,JSME INT J III-VIB C,,DEC,1990.0,33.0,4,,,,,465,474,,10.1299/jsmec1988.33.465,,,,10,"Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,EV405,WOS:A1990EV40500001,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Since the dental implant must extend from the mandibular or maxillary jaw, through the oral mucosa, and into the oral cavity, these tissue responses include epithelium, connective tissue and bone. The continual occlusal forces acting upon these tissues reinforce the dynamic character of these tissue responses. Immediately upon implantation, a healing phase begins as a response to the implanted biomaterial. Following this immediate response a longer healing phase occurs, beginning approximately 1 week after implantation, resulting in the modeling of bone to the implant as well as the formation of epithelial attachment to the implant. This later, delayed healing continues throughout the lifetime of the implant since these tissues must die and be replaced by similar tissues. Current dental research employing scanning electron microscopy is now documenting these tissue responses. This paper reviews, in detail, SEM observations of these tissue responses.","MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL SURG,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT PROSTHODONT,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT RESTORAT DENT,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294","STEFLIK, DE (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,64,10,10,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",0891-7035,,,SCANNING MICROSCOPY,Scanning Microsc.,DEC,1990.0,4.0,4,,,,,1021,1038,,,,,,18,Microscopy,Microscopy,EY836,WOS:A1990EY83600015,2094003.0,,,,2019-02-25

One of the most important functions is the screening for toxic effects of the biomaterials. The spectrum of changes elicited ranges from cell death to alterations of cell adhesion, proliferation and biosynthetic activity. Such test systems may involve the direct contact of cells with the biomaterials or the use of soluble extracts of the latter. The rapid, cost-effective and highly sensitive in vitro methods have to be weighed against the problem of validity of extrapolation to the in vivo situation. The first step in testing potential biomaterials may be termed ""general"" biocompatibility testing and usually involves the use of various cell lines (i.e. transformed cells) which can be easily cultivated and passaged in the laboratory for long periods. Although the latter is convenient and highly sensitive for recognizing and excluding toxic materials at an early stage in the process of toxicity testing, this method cannot be regarded as exhaustive. It is proposed that such screening methods be followed by a second in vitro phase, in which primary and early passage cells of a type relevant to the proposed application of the medical device are used. This ""specific"" biocompatibility testing is an attempt to simulate the in vivo situation as closely as possible. A further component of such a testing scheme involves the use of relevant biological parameters, such as cell adhesion or the production of specific biosynthetic products by the relevant cell type. It is thus possible to construct a spectrum of in vitro changes, ranging from marked inhibition of growth with frank cell death (""not biocompatible"") to marked stimulation of relevant growth and other cell biological parameters (""biocompatible and bioactive""). An expansion of in vitro testing methods can offer a method to ""tailor"" biomaterials for specific in vivo applications. In conclusion, it must be stressed that all in vitro experimentation, whether ""general"" of ""specific"", cannot replace the subsequent in vivo testing. Both components are necessary in an adequate scheme for testing potential biomaterials.",,"KIRKPATRICK, CJ (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,INST PATHOL,W-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,101,101,0,7,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Two new techniques, not previously used in biomaterials research involving the study of locomotor morphology of neutrophils and cell movement through agarose gels, were used in this study. Chromium ion concentrations from 0.05 to 10 p.p.m. and cobalt ion concentrations from 0.5 to 30 p.p.m. were not chemotactic for neutrophils under agarose and did not induce neutrophils to polarize. As neutrophils must take up a locomotor morphology before migrating, it is clear that cobalt and chromium ions in a protein-free environment are not chemotactic for human neutrophils. Concentrations of > 2.5 p.p.m. nickel ions did induce neutrophils to polarize, probably a result of the nickel ions causing depolarization of the neutrophil plasma membrane.",,"REMES, A (reprint author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,INST MED & DENT BIOENGN,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,0,16,16,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The dynamic sorption process of radiolabelled proteins on the surfaces was followed by detecting the radioactivity at the exit stream of the column, which was the response of a pulse stimulus at the inlet. The mathematical model was described and solved using 'parameter estimation by cybernetic moment technique', and the adsorption rate constants of plasma proteins on different biomaterial surfaces were calculated. By evaluation of the response curves with standard and cybernetic moment techniques, the following results were obtained. Albumin and fibrinogen adsorption is competitive, and the competition is strongly dependent upon the surface characteristics of the biomaterial. Preadsorption or preferential adsorption of albumin decreases the fibrinogen adsorption, and therefore increases the biocompatibility of material surface. Adsorption of blood plasma proteins are irreversible. The moment technique can also be used for the evaluation of stimulus-response data of biological systems, to determine the process parameters.",,"MUTLU, M (reprint author), HACETTEPE UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BEYTAPE CAMPUS,GR-06532 ANKARA,TURKEY.",,"MUTLU, MEHMET/B-3240-2013","MUTLU, MEHMET/0000-0001-9610-9817; Mutlu, Mehmet/0000-0001-7146-1937",,,,28,11,11,0,2,PETER PEREGRINUS LTD,HERTS,"SOUTHGATE HOUSE STEVENAGE PO BOX 8, HERTS, ENGLAND SG1 1HQ",0140-0118,,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

The strategy for achieving of biological activity of polymers, the designs of them, polymers syntheses, and biological and biomedical examinations are discussed. As polymeric anticancer drugs polymeric prodrugs having 5-fluorouracil moieties were prepared and their in vivo activity was investigated using Ehrlich's Sarcoma 180 ascites tumor-bearing mice. It was found that polysaccharide-coated-liposome encapsuled nucleic acid analogs show potent immunomodulating activities. This was done by monitoring the in vitro superoxide anion production from activated human neutrophils and in vivo from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, heparin and/or prostaglandin I2-immobilized hydrogel was entrapped in poly(vinyl chloride). From the result of the activated partial thromboplastin time, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and hole blood clotting time using human blood it was seen that the drug-immobilized antithrombogenic biomaterials provide high antithrombogenicity.","OSAKA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL FINE CHEM,SUITA,OSAKA 565,JAPAN","AKASHI, M (reprint author), KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL CHEM,1-21-40 KORIMOTO,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN.",,,,,,,90,16,17,1,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,Adv.

Knowledge of interactions with biomaterials and the resultant pathophysiological reactions is still very limited. The safety of the heart-lung machine lies, to a great extent, in the hands of the operator; precautions against breakdowns and accidents are necessary. The effects of the extracorporeal circulation process manifest themselves clinically as organ malfunctions. The risk is clearly associated with the age of the patient and the duration of the procedure. The fact that the extracorporeal circulation-and with it the heart operation - affects not just a single organ, but rather the entire organism, requires detailed knowledge of the general state of health of the patient to be operated upon.

The method is based on depositing a pulse of heat into the material of choice, and fitting the subsequent local temperature decay to that predicted by a theoretical model. This transient method is most suitable in situations where frequent measurements of the thermal conductivity are desired. The method was evaluated by calculating the thermal conductivity of several inert materials. The measured conductivities compared well with published values. The developed technique was also used to examine the applicability of the ""apparent conductivity"" index to combine both conductive and blood-convective thermal effects in living, blood perfused tissues. Using both simulated and experimental results, it was shown that the changes in the apparent conductivity are highly correlated with changes in blood flow.
