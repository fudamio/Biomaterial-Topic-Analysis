This ECM, obtained by removing BCEC with an hypotonic shock can be used as a substratum for other endothelial cell growth. Human endothelial cells (HEC) were purified from omentum that was digested with a solution of collagenase-dispase, then filtered through nylon meshes. The cells were further purified by centrifugation onto a Percoll gradient. A comparative study on the attachment and growth of HEC on various coatings (laminin, poly-L-lysine, fibronectin or ECM) indicates that ECM is the most performing substratum. The quality of this endothelium was confirmed by the presence of factor VIII, and MHC class I and the absence of class II antigens.","CHU HENRI MONDOR,CTR RECH CHIRURG,CNRS,URA 1431,F-94010 CRETEIL,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 12,RECH CROISSANCE CELLULAIRE REPARAT & REGENERAT TISSULAIRES LAB,F-94000 CRETEIL,FRANCE",,,,,,,,13,10,10,0,0,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Adsorption of fibrinogen from blood plasma to many materials exhibits a maximum with respect to plasma dilution and exposure time (the Vroman effect). In this study fibrinogen adsorption to several polymers was examined to ascertain the influence of controlled changes in surface chemistry on the Vroman effect. The materials included hydroxyethylmethacrylate-ethylmethacrylate (HEMA/EMA) copolymers, Biomer, and a series of segmented polyurethanes (PEUs), two of which contained fluorinated chain extenders. Each material exhibited maximal adsorption of fibrinogen at intermediate plasma concentrations. Little effect of soft-segment type or molecular weight was observed and no significant differences in fibrinogen adsorption to the fluorinated PEUs were seen. Changes in the strength of fibrinogen attachment to these materials with time after adsorption were also assessed. Fibrinogen adsorbed for 1 min was displaced more readily by blood plasma than that adsorbed for 1 h, regardless of the material. The more hydrophobic polymers exhibited greater retention of adsorbed fibrinogen. In addition, the fraction of fibrinogen retained by polyethylene depended on the amount of fibrinogen adsorbed to the surface, being greatest when the surface loading was the least. These studies indicate that spreading or transition of adsorbed fibrinogen molecules from a weakly to tightly bound state is a general consequence of protein adsorption to solid surfaces.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT CHEM ENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195","SLACK, SM (reprint author), MEMPHIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,MEMPHIS,TN 38152, USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL25951, HL19419]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296]",,,45,39,39,1,4,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Confocal microscopy enables high-resolution imaging to be achieved below semitransparent surfaces in intact living specimens, but this may still be impractical for intraoral applications because of the need to stabilize the sample. The development of a steadying objective (X 240 overall mag.) which is held against the sample surface and is focused by moving internal elements, avoids the need for fine adjustment of the living sample under the microscope to achieve a change of focus. It is therefore more comfortable and also reduces the problems of movement due to the pulse. The objective was used with a tandem scanning microscope, with images recorded via a SIT video camera. Using this system internal tooth structure (e.g. enamel prisms/adhesive restoration interfaces) and the lining cells of the gingival crevice through to the junctional epithelium may be examined. It is also possible to image the oral mucous membrane, focusing to the capillary loops in the basal layers, where streaming red blood cells can be seen. Access is limited to the anterior regions as far back as the premolar teeth. Applications could include caries research, soft and hard tissue responses to biomaterials (e.g. implants), wound healing and monitoring the effect of periodontal treatment regimens. This new technique offers numerous exciting opportunities for the microscopic investigation of many clinical operative procedures in vivo, allowing the response of the tissues to be non-destructively monitored, over time, at high resolution.","UNITED MED & DENT SCH GUYS & ST THOMAS HOSP,GUYS HOSP,DEPT CONSERVAT DENT,LONDON,ENGLAND",,,"Watson, Timothy/C-6815-2013","Watson, Timothy/0000-0001-6039-3780",,,,14,23,23,1,2,BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0300-5712,,,J DENT,J.

Both networks show large contact-angle hysteresis due to surface heterogenity and surface rearrangements. The balance of the polar/nonpolar forces of the dry networks, as quantitated by the I(p)/W(A)d ratio is much below unity; upon equilibrating in water the I(p)/W(A)d ratio increases but remains below unity. Protein adsorption from human plasma and human monocyte adhesion to A and amphiphilic networks possessing polar/nonpolar ratios lower than unity have been investigated. Both networks adsorb less fibrinogen, albumin and Hageman factor (factor XII) than glass, polyethylene (PE), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The extent of adsorption of factor VIII on A, H and glass are very similar. Adsorption of IgG on A was appreciable, however, on H it was less than on any of the other surfaces studied. Monocyte adhesion was significantly inhibited on both networks and glass, relative to a positive adhesive surface such as tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS Evidently both the A and the H networks exhibit reduced protein adsorption and cell adhesion which indicates biocompatibility of these networks at blood contacting surfaces. The ratio of the polar/nonpolar forces expresed by the I(p)/W(A)d ratio may be useful to predict low protein adsorption and cell adhesion on polymer surfaces.","UNIV AKRON,INST POLYMER SCI,AKRON,OH 44325; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL & MACROMOLEC,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; RES INST PLAST IND,H-1950 BUDAPEST,HUNGARY",,,,,,,,27,44,45,2,16,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0170-0839,,,POLYM BULL,Polym.

The complement system is activated by exposure of different biomaterials to blood. Recently a watertight knitted Dacron aortic prosthesis impregnated with bovine collagen has been developed. One potential disadvantage is that this bovine collagen may activate the complement system and evoke the production of inflammatory mediators. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortic surgery with implantation of Dacron prosthesis on the complement system in the perioperative period and at 3 months after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 2 1). Twelve patients who had cholecystectomy served as controls. CH50 consumption and C3a generation were determined to study overall complement activation. Furthermore, C3a/C3 fractions were calculated. Finally, C4 and factor B consumption were determined to evaluate the complement stimulation via the classic and the alternative pathways, respectively. We found significant activation of the complement system during the operation in both the collagen group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p = 0.03; C4 consumption: 74%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 73%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction increase: 173%, p = 0.04), and the nonimpregnated group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p < 0.0001; C4 consumption: 71%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 76%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction increase: 165%,p = 0.025), with no statistically significant differences between the groups of prostheses. Activation was initiated via both the classic and the alternative pathway. This indicates aortic implantation significantly activates the complement system, but that collagen-impregnated prostheses do not stimulate the complement system any more than its nonsealed substrate. Comparing results in patients with vascular disease with controls, a significantly increased complement activation was observed in the vascular group (CH50 consumption: 40%,p < 0.0001; C4 consumption: 74%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 75%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction: 169%, p = 0.002), compared with the controls (CH50 consumption: 71%; CA consumption: 104%; factor B consumption: 94%; C3a/C3 fraction: 119%, all p = NS), with statistical significant differences between the vascular group and cholecystectomies (CH50: p = 0.005; C4: p = 0.002; factor B: p < 0.0001, and C3a/C3 fraction: NS). This observation demonstrates that aortic surgery with the implantation of a Dacron prosthesis significantly activates the complement system.","UNIV HOSP LEIDEN, DEPT NEPHROL, 2300 RC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS; UNIV HOSP LEIDEN, GAUBIUS LAB, 2300 RC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","VANOTTERLOO, JCAD (reprint author), UNIV HOSP LEIDEN, DEPT SURG, POB 9600, 2300 RC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,31,20,20,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

These soluble or insoluble polymers are derived from polystyrene and dextran. Such functional polymers may be endowed with anticoagulant heparin-like properties and, as a consequence, possess low thrombogenicity when they are in contact with flowing blood. Other functional polymers have been tailored specifically to interact with components of the immune system. Other polymers, in contact with cells can affect both cell growth and cell biological functions or only cell biological activity without necessarily undergoing change in all characteristics. Derived from the above concepts, it is possible to demonstrate that a random statistical distribution of chemical groups along the macromolecular backbone correlates with the biological properties of these polymers.",,"JOZEFONVICZ, J (reprint author), CNRS,RECH MACROMOLEC LAB,URA 502,AVE JB CLEMENT,F-93430 VILLETANEUSE,FRANCE.",,,,,,,10,14,15,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0033-4545,,,PURE APPL CHEM,Pure Appl.

We found that the ability of S. epidermidis to hemagglutinate erythrocytes correlated with the adherence of bacteria to plastic and to intravenous catheters. S. epidermidis isolates responsible for prosthetic-valve endocarditis (n = 61) and isolates from intravenous catheters (n = 59) were significantly more likely to cause hemagglutination than isolates from the skin of preoperative cardiac surgery patients (n = 19) (P = 0.027). S. epidermidis isolates (n = 23) recovered from the skin of patients 7 to 10 days after cardiac surgery were significantly more likely to exhibit hemagglutination than the preoperative isolates (P = 0.015). By a quantitative adherence assay, we also observed that the hemagglutination titer and number of species of erythrocytes agglutinated correlated directly with adherence to polystyrene (P < 0.001). In addition, hemagglutinating isolates were significantly more likely to be recovered in high number from intravenous catheters when semiquantitative catheter culture techniques were used (P < 0.001). We speculate that hemagglutinin(s) either plays a direct role in adherence to polymers and thus prosthetic-device infection or serves as an easily demonstrable marker for adherence-prone isolates.","VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIV,MED COLL VIRGINIA,DEPT INTERNAL MED,DIV INFECT DIS,RICHMOND,VA 23298",,,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [AI 21772, F32 AI 08416]",,,38,51,51,0,2,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

In spite of some disparities, the TiN behavior towards albumin and fibrinogen is interesting, compared with the one of a reference medical grade elastomer. The platelet retention test gives similar results as those achieved with the same elastomer. The hemolysis percentage is near to zero.

The interface between this mineralized ECM and the HA was studied at the ultrastructural level with scanning and transmission electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis. Initially, the deposition of a globular, afibrillar matrix was observed on HA. This was followed by the integration of collagen fibers in this matrix and their subsequent mineralization. At the bone-HA interface two distinctly different interfacial structures were observed. An electron-dense layer with a thickness of 20-60 nm was regularly present, which contained both organic and inorganic material and was rich in glycosaminoglycans. The interfaces differed however, in the presence or absence of an amorphous zone which was free of collagen fibers and had an average thickness of 0.7-0.8-mu-m. It was frequently seen interposed between the electron-dense layer and the hydroxyapatite. Similar interfacial structures have also been described in the in vivo environment, where they were referred to as lamina limitans-like or cement linelike.

The resulting copolymers have physical properties similar to those of PEG while the carboxylic acid groups Of L-lysine provide multiple pendent groups along the polymer backbone for further functionalization. By using PEG chains of different molecular weights, a homologous series of PEG-Lys copolymers was prepared containing one lysine unit every 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Da. The pendent carboxylic acid groups were utilized in cross-linking reactions leading to amide cross-links, new acyl semicarbazide cross-links, and hydroxyethyl acrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate derived cross-links. The resulting hydrogels formed transparent, highly swollen films. At an equilibrium water content of about 80%, these films exhibited a relatively high degree of tensile strength ranging from 0.26 to 1.09 MPa.

Lower levels of maximal platelet deposition were obtained for VN-coated silicone rubber (SR) than for other VN-coated substrates with comparable levels of adsorbed VN, but this effect was diminished with increased residence time of VN on the SR surface. Submonolayer and monolayer surface concentrations of VN elicited similar maximal levels of platelet deposition at both short (<3 h) and long (>12 h) residence times, but thrombi were larger and more dense for the submonolayer surface concentrations. VN was also more effective in forming thrombi when adsorbed sequentially before albumin instead of after albumin. To further examine these differences in the nature of adsorbed VN between substrates and adsorption conditions, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) elutability measurements and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance optics (FTIR-ATR) evaluations of the adsorbed protein were performed. An SDS solution was able to remove a greater percentage of the VN which was adsorbed to a submonolayer than a monolayer surface concentration when SDS displacement was initiated immediately after adsorption was terminated. However, if the adsorbed protein was allowed to reside on the surface for a length of time before the introduction of the SDS displacing media, a greater percentage of the monolayer surface concentration was removed. The submonolayer surface concentration may be better able to increase its strength of contact with the surface during the added residence time than the monolayer surface concentration. FTIR-ATR spectra of VN showed less structural alterations when it was adsorbing to SR than to a segmented polyurethane, a more thrombogenic material when coated with VN. Thus, the ability of VN to stimulate thrombus formation appeared to correlate with the percentage of VN which was nonelutable by SDS and the amount of structural alterations observed by FTIR-ATR, both of which are indications of its extent of contact with the surface.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT CHEM ENGN, 1415 W JOHNSON DR, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT MED, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-24046, HL-21001]",,,42,12,12,0,4,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-6245,2567-689X,,THROMB HAEMOSTASIS,Thromb.

Human peripheral blood neutrophils were incubated with several sterile, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free biomaterials used in surgically implantable prosthetic devices: polyurethane, woven dacron, and velcro. Free radical formation as the superoxide (O2-) anion was evaluated by cytochrome c reduction in neutrophils that were exposed to the materials and then removed and in neutrophils allowed to remain in association with the materials. Neutrophils exposed to polyurethane or woven dacron for 30 or 60 min and then removed consistently exhibited an enhanced release of O2- after simulation via receptor engagement with formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Enhanced reactivity to stimulation via protein kinase C with phorbol myristate acetate, however, was not consistently observed. The cells evaluated for O2- release during continous association with the biomaterials showed enhanced metabolic activity during short periods of association (especially with polyurethane and woven dacron). Although O2- release by neutrophils in association with these materials decreased with longer periods of incubation, it was not obliterated. These studies, therefore, show that several commonly used biomaterials activate neutrophils soon after exposure and that this activated state diminishes with prolonged exposure but nevertheless remains measurable. The diminishing level of activity with prolonged exposure, however, suggests that ultimately a depletion of reactivity may occur and may result in increased susceptibility to periprosthetic infection.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT MOLEC GENET & BIOCHEM,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213; UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213","KAPLAN, SS (reprint author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213, USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM41734-01],,,28,49,49,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

However, collagen-based biomaterials may induce cytotoxic effects. This study evaluated possible cytotoxic effects of (crosslinked) dermal sheep collagen (DSC) using a 7-d-methylcellulose cell culture with human skin fibroblasts. Noncrosslinked DSC (NDSC), hexamethylene-diisocyanate-crosslinked DSC (HDSC), and glutaraldehyde-crosslinked DSC (GDSC), their extracts (1 x 10 d to 4 x 10 d extracts), or the corresponding extracted DSC samples were tested. Cell growth was evaluated by cell counting, while cell morphology was assessed by light microscopy and transmission-electron microscopy. Both GDSC and, to a lesser extent, HDSC, induced cytotoxicity, observed as inhibited cell growth and deviant cell morphology. The deviant morphology consisted of extensive accumulations of lipid, reduction in the amount and dilatation of rough endoplasmatic reticulum, increased inclusions of cell remnants, and relatively rounded cell membranes. With HDSC, both primary cytotoxicity, due to extractable products from the material, and secondary cytotoxicity, possibly due to a release of cytotoxic products resulting from enzymatic cell-biomaterial interactions, could be discriminated. With GDSC, however, no clear distinction between primary and secondary cytotoxicity could be made. With NDSC, only primary cytotoxicity, measured as low inhibition of cell proliferation, but without deviant morphology, was observed. These remarkable differences in cytotoxicity are discussed in relation to residual agents and specific crosslinks present in DSCs as a consequence of processing and the crosslinking agents used. The residual agents and the specific crosslinks give rise to differences in direct release of products and in sensitivity to hydrolysis and enzymatic breakdown.","TWENTE UNIV,DEPT CHEM TECHNOL,7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,BIOMAT RES SECT,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,38,113,113,1,13,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The biocompatibility of the treated and control sponges was studied up to 3 months after subcutaneous implantation in rats by analysing cellular responses and calcification by histological and ultrastructural methods. A control collagen-glycosaminoglycan sponge was rapidly invaded by mononuclear cells (8 days), with the formation of granulation tissue. Calcification was observed at the periphery of the implant after 8 days, and the implant was entirely calcified after 15 days; it was degraded progressively after 30 days. Acyl azide treatment increased the persistence of the sponge in vivo up to 90 days and inhibited its calcification. A glutaraldehyde-treated sponge was completely calcified after 15 days, and calcified nodules persisted after 90 days. Thus, acyl azide method efficiently cross-linked a collagen-glycosaminoglycan sponge and inhibited calcification after subcutaneous implantation in rats (at least up to 90 days after implantation).",,"ANSELME, K (reprint author), UNIV LYON 1,INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS,URA 412,CYTOL MOLEC LAB,F-69622 VILLEURBANNE,FRANCE.",,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060; Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,39,26,26,0,3,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0934-8832,,,MATRIX,Matrix,AUG,1992.0,12.0,4,,,,,264,273,,10.1016/S0934-8832(11)80078-8,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,JK670,WOS:A1992JK67000003,1435510.0,,,,2019-02-25

A transition was measured from the dilute to the entangled polymer solution regimes with increasing PEO molecular weight (at constant PEO weight fraction) or with increasing PEO weight fraction (at constant PEO molecular weight). In solutions containing approximately 10 % w/w PEO, the transition was detected in the vicinity of PEO 10 000 Da, which supports our recently advanced hypothesis that changes in PEO molecular weight influence protein partitioning in the two-phase aqueous PEO-dextran system through an accompanying transition in the structure of the PEO-rich solution phase. To elucidate the roles of repulsive steric and attractive forces on the interactions of hydrophilic proteins and PEO, SANS measurements of (1) aqueous solutions of PEO 8650 Da containing identifiable PEO coils, (2) aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and (3) aqueous solutions containing a mixture of BSA and PEO 8650 Da were performed. Although the net interaction between the 8650 Da PEO and BSA was found to be strongly repulsive, the second virial coefficient reflecting protein-polymer interactions was found to be only 80 % of the value predicted for purely excluded-volume interactions, thus suggesting the existence of an attractive interaction between a PEO coil and BSA. A quantitative model of the solution structure indicates that an attractive interaction energy of about 0.05kT (per polymer segment interacting with the protein) is sufficient to describe the influence of BSA-PEO interactions on the SANS intensity measurements. This is consistent with recently developed statistical-thermodynamic models of protein-polymer interactions in the two-phase aqueous PEO-dextran system.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,,,,,,55,72,72,1,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 20,1992.0,25.0,15,,,,,3932,3941,,10.1021/ma00041a016,,,,10,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JE746,WOS:A1992JE74600016,,,,,2019-02-25

It was found that neither the inhibition of platelet function nor the removal of platelets from blood significantly changed the clot formation rate on glass and polyvinyl chloride in comparison to the rate for whole blood. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that platelets were not involved in clot formation near the blood/biomaterial interface. Thus, it was concluded that the system of contact activation of the coagulation cascade dominates during clot formation under static conditions.

This study was designed to evaluate the release of these cytokines by human monocytes (HM) brought into contact with four biomaterials utilized in clinical practice: polyurethane, expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE), Dacron velour, and woven Dacron. In vitro cultures for the generation of IL-1 and TNF by HM in the presence of the above biomaterials were established by exposing cells to each biomaterial in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with harvest of supernatants after 6 or 18 h. These studies showed that in the absence of LPS, IL-1 was released only by Dacron velour and woven Dacron associated monocytes while TNF was secreted in response to all of the materials. When LPS was present, however, monocytes associated with all of the materials released IL-1; and TNF release was greatly augmented. Further, the quantity of released cytokine was directly related to the duration of the association time. This study demonstrated that HM in association with various biomaterials were activated to produce both TNF and IL-1 and that the addition of nanogram quantities of LPS, such as would be produced if infection were present, greatly increased the amount of cytokines released.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261",,,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM-41734],,,34,75,75,0,7,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

In this study the contribution that adsorption of serum fibronectin (Fn) or vitronectin (Vn) make to the attachment and spreading of fibroblast cells during the first 90 min following seeding was determined for two modified tissue culture polystyrenes, as model biomaterial surfaces. The amount of serum Vn and Fn which adsorbed onto tissue culture grade polystyrene (TCP) from different serum concentrations over the range of 0.1-30% (v/v) were determined and compared to attachment of cells of the BHK-21 and HT1080 fibroblast lines. There was no simple correlation between the amount of Fn or the amount of Vn adsorbed and cell attachment and spreading. The requirement for Fn or Vn for attachment and spreading of BHK-21 or HT1080 cells onto modified polystyrene (either TCP or to Primaria) during the first 90 min of cell culture was directly tested by selective removal of Fn or Vn from the serum prior to addition to the culture medium. Attachment and spreading of BHK-21 or HT1080 cells onto TCP or Primaria surfaces were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when the cells were seeded in medium containing 2% (v/v) or higher concentrations of Vn-depleted serum. BHK-21 cells or HT1080 cells seeded in medium containing Fn-depleted serum (which contained Vn) attached and spread onto TCP or Primaria. Both BHK-21 cells and HT1080 cells failed to attach to TCP or Primaria when seeded in medium containing serum depleted of both Vn and Fn. The requirement for serum Vn or Fn for fibroblast attachment to TCP was also tested using cells of a human dermal fibroblast strain. The attachment of the dermal fibroblasts to TCP during the first 90 min of culture was not decreased by depletion of Vn from the 15% (v/v) serum, but there was a reduction in the proportion of the attached cells which had spread. Selective depletion of serum Fn did not have any effect on either cell attachment or spreading. Our results show that for fibroblast cells, particularly with cell lines such as BHK-21 or HT1080 but also with cell strains, the first binding of cells onto tissue culture polystyrene when plated in medium containing serum is a result of adsorption onto the surface of serum Vn.

The biocompatibility studies showed that the interface materials were noncytotoxic to mouse and human fibroblasts, as shown by morphologic evaluation, and by determination of extracellular LDH; and they did not stimulate interleukin-1-like production from human monocytes, as indicated by a thymocyte proliferation assay. The human fibroblast proliferation assay showed that three of the polymers supported cell growth at levels comparable to, or greater than, polymer controls, while the hydrophobic PPHMDSZ inhibited both cell attachment and proliferation.

This model was compared to an in vitro model of non-spontaneous formation of calcium phosphate precipitate. To study the role of porosity/fluid absorption capacity, various biomaterials such as polyurethane, hydrophilic polyurethane foam, Type I collagen sponges, and bioprosthetic heart valve tissue were examined in in vitro and in vivo models. In view of the exceedingly low levels of polyurethane calcification, it seems that the rat subcutaneous model is not suitable for routine studies of the mechanism of polyurethane calcification. The calcification extent of both collageneous and hydrophilic polyurethane, was found to be in good correlation with the water absorption capacity of these biomaterials. It is suggested that the water capacity of the biomaterial determines the bulk level of calcification, which in turn is generated and propagates via the inherent affinity sites of the biomaterial to Ca2+.",,"GOLOMB, G (reprint author), HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,SCH PHARM,DEPT PHARM,POB 12065,IL-91120 JERUSALEM,ISRAEL.",,,"Golomb, Gershon/0000-0002-7369-9831",,,,49,16,16,1,7,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The wettability of these biomaterials in relationship to their microenvironment is an important factor to consider when characterizing surface behaviour. The measure of the contact angle between a fluid and material surface can be used to define wettability for that particular microenvironment. In this study, pure Ti, Ti6Al4V alloy, austenitic and martensitic Ni-Ti alloys, pure Ni, AISI Type 316L stainless steel, Co-Cr alloy, and alpha-alumina were investigated. All metallic materials were mechanically polished and oxidized at 300-degrees-C for 30 min in pure oxygen. Oxide films formed on the surfaces of these materials were examined under the electron microscope and their crystalline structures were identified by the electron diffraction method. The initial contact angle (theta-0) and its changes (delta-theta/delta-t) as a function of time in 1% NaCl solution drop were measured. The results of this study indicated that (i) Ti and its alloys were covered with mainly TiO2 (tetragonal structure), (ii) NiO (cubic structure) was found on pure Ni, (iii) the spinel type oxide (cubic structure) was formed on both 316L stainless steel and Co-Cr alloy, (iv) TiO2 (except for oxides formed on Ti6Al4V alloy) showed a rapid spreading characteristic in 1% NaCl solution; while (v) a relatively slow spreading behaviour was observed on the cubic structure oxides.","BAYLOR COLL DENT,DEPT ORTHODONT,DALLAS,TX 75246; UNIV TSUKUBA,INST MAT SCI,TSUKUBA,IBARAKI 305,JAPAN","OSHIDA, Y (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,SCH DENT,DEPT DENT MAT,1121 W MICHIGAN ST,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202, USA.",,"Miyazaki, Shuichi/A-3113-2012","Miyazaki, Shuichi/0000-0003-3849-4176",,,,17,38,38,0,8,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The purpose of this study was to provide a precise, three-dimensional evaluation of soft-tissue response to surface modifications in both implantation and expansion. Expandable 100-cc prostheses were designed with one of three surfaces: textured silicone (Biocell), standard smooth silicone, or polyurethane (Natural-Y, Meme). A new submuscular implantation site in the rabbit was developed. Each animal randomly received a smooth-surface device on one side and either a textured silicone or polyurethane device on the other. In one group of animals, the prostheses were expanded monthly. Capsular response was evaluated monthly in vivo using standardized techniques as well as biomechanical methods for up to 6 months in the expander group (n = 7 to 16) and 8 months in the implant group (n = 7 to 15). Analysis of biomechanical and histologic data revealed that prosthetic surface morphology can specifically alter capsular response. Polyurethane was the only effective surface in preventing capsular contracture in implantation. In expansion, both textured silicone and polyurethane surfaces resulted in significantly less capsular contracture and less resistance to expansion than comparable smooth-surfaced controls. Statistical comparisons reveal that the biomechanical methods utilized in this study provide the most precise and objective method of defining overall soft-tissue contracture around implanted biomaterials.","MED COLL OHIO HOSP,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,TOLEDO,OH; ST VINCENTS MED CTR,TOLEDO,OH; VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT ORTHOPAED & REHABIL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240; VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PLAST SURG,NASHVILLE,TN 37240; BAPTIST HOSP,INST AESTHET & RECONSTRUCT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN; MEHARRY MED COLL,DEPT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN 37208",,,,,,,,30,92,96,0,5,WILLIAMS & WILKINS,BALTIMORE,"351 WEST CAMDEN ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21201-2436",0032-1052,,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

The beta-spiral of poly(VPGVG) represents a new family of molecular structures in fibrous proteins. In particular for our interests here, aromatic amino acid residue substitutions at position four of poly(VPGVG) give rise to new polypeptides with interesting properties of increased elastic modulus, pressure sensitivity, etc. Molecular mechanics computations were carried out to answer the question, can the polypeptides with Phe, Tyr, and Trp substitution at position four of poly(VPGVG) form a beta-spiral structure like poly(VPGVG)? Employed in this study was a combination of conformational search using ECEPP/2 and the build-up strategy and of molecular dynamics calculations using CHARMm. The results indicate that the VPGX Type II beta-turn structure appears to be the most prominent secondary structural feature for the three aromatic residues containing polypentapeptides, although there is more evidence for VPGFG and VPGYG to assume the VPGVG-type structure than for VPGWG to do so.

The mechanism by which this apparently trivial maneuver reduces platelet deposition was investigated. Polypropylene suture (7-0 Prolene) was passed through human arteries (fetal and adult), and platelet deposition to the suture was measured in a standardized perfusion chamber. Single vessel passage of the sutures reduced platelet deposition by 68+/-23%, which contrasts sharply with the power of prostaglandin E1 (1-mu-M PGE1 is sufficient to abolish platelet shape change and aggregation), which inhibited only 11% of platelet deposition to the sutures. Aspirin treatment of the vessel (to prevent PGI2 formation) or endothelial stripping (to remove the ability to produce nitric oxide) had no effect on the degree of inhibition. Passage of the suture through a vessel analogue (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) did not inhibit platelet deposition. I-125-fibrinogen adsorption to the suture after vessel passage was reduced to a degree similar to that of platelet deposition. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins eluted from vessel-passed sutures revealed bands at 66, 47, and 16 kd. Western blotting indicated the presence of large amounts of albumin and hemoglobin, a moderate amount of haptoglobin, and only trace amounts of fibrinogen. When sutures were exposed to each of these proteins in vitro before perfusion, albumin and hemoglobin were found to reproduce the effect of vessel passage alone on platelet deposition. We conclude that albumin and hemoglobin adsorb to sutures during their passage through the vessel subendothelium. This reduces the subsequent adsorption of fibrinogen from blood, thereby reducing the ability of platelets to attach to the suture.","UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT SURG, PITTSBURGH, PA 15261 USA; UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT PATHOL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15261 USA; MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT CHEM ENGN, HAMILTON L8S 4L8, ONTARIO, CANADA","JOHNSON, PC (reprint author), UNIV PITTSBURGH, DIV PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG, 676 SCAIFE HALL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15261 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R29 HL-45891],,,51,3,3,0,2,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596 USA",1049-8834,,,ARTERIOSCLER THROMB,Arterioscler.

Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) discs served as the biomaterial substratum in this study. Suspension cultures of SE-46 at 10(8) CFU/mL were allowed to adhere to PMMA discs for 2, 6, or 12 h prior to exposure to cephaloridine at 250-mu-g/mL, which is 500 times greater than the MIC of 0.5-mu-g/mL. After a 24-h exposure to the antibiotic viable bacteria adherent to the disc were removed and counted. Those data revealed that at shorter adherence times a larger percentage of the adherent organism were erradicated by antibiotic exposure, 83.6% versus 15.6% for 2-h and 12-h adherence times, respectively. Although a significant percent of the organisms were killed with short adherence times, the organism still persisted in the face of high concentrations of cephaloridine. Scanning electron micrographs of organism adherent for 2 and 12 h revealed distinct morphological changes in the extracellular matrix indicating increased matrix production with longer adherence. Thus, these data reveal that adherence to biomaterials provides a protected environment for the bacteria and the time an organism is adherent to a biomaterial surface prior to antibiotic exposure can also increase the organism's resistance to antibiotics.","KYUSHU UNIV, FAC MED, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, FUKUOKA 812, JAPAN; MED SCI RES INST, SCI ADVISORY BOARD, KNOXVILLE, TN USA; MED SCI RES INST, HERNDON, VA USA",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",1045-4861,,,J APPL BIOMATER,J.

The chemical was analyzed for different genotoxicity endpoints, to obtain both information on its possible mutagenic/carcinogenic potential and a model analysis of a tertiary arylamine, which belongs to a class of chemicals commonly used as polymerization accelerators in the biomaterial field. The genotoxicity endpoints considered were: gene mutation in the Salmonella test; structural and numerical chromosome alterations in Chinese hamster V79 cells, evaluated by the micronucleus test together with an immunofluorescent staining specific for kinetochore proteins; in vitro and in vivo DNA damage, evaluated in V79 cells and in mouse liver by the alkaline DNA elution technique. On the whole, the results indicate that N-acryloyl-N'-phenylpiperazine is to be regarded not so much as a DNA-damaging agent, but as a genomic mutagen. Indeed, it was not mutagenic in Salmonella (though its toxicity did not allow testing concentrations over 70-mu-g/plate), and it was weakly positive in inducing chromosomal fragmentation in vitro (one positive, not dose-related, result out of five different doses tested) and in vivo DNA damage (increases in DNA elution rate never doubling control values). The chemical was, however, clearly positive (with dose-dependent effects up to about 25 times the control value) in causing numerical chromosome alterations, at the maximal non-toxic doses.","UNIV GENOA,CIRC,INST ONCOL,I-16132 GENOA,ITALY; UNIV PERUGIA,DEPT HYG,I-06100 PERUGIA,ITALY; UNIV MILAN,DEPT BIOENGN,I-20133 MILAN,ITALY; CNR,IST MUTAGENESI & DIFFERENZIAMENTO,I-56100 PISA,ITALY","TANINGHER, M (reprint author), NATL INST CANC RES,VIALE BENEDETTO XV NO 10,I-16132 GENOA,ITALY.",,"Tanzi, Maria Cristina/I-4620-2013","Tanzi, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-4913-6633",,,,9,5,5,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8262,,,MUTAT RES,,JUN,1992.0,282.0,2,,,,,99,105,,10.1016/0165-7992(92)90081-R,,,,7,Genetics & Heredity; Toxicology,Genetics & Heredity; Toxicology,HY734,WOS:A1992HY73400007,1377358.0,,,,2019-02-25

There was good correlation between the cytotoxicity and the thickness of inflammatory layer. Histological findings showed that the inflammatory layer of radiation vulcanized natural rubber latex (RVNRL) films involved a slightly higher response than the negative implant at the 3rd post operative day although the inflammatory layer showed almost the same degree as the negative controls at the 7th day. The cytotoxic potential of the extracts prepared from RVNRL films was found to be weak by the colony assay. The hemolytic activity was also detected in the extracts of RVNRL films. The lysis of red blood cells and the release of haemoglobin was clearly caused by RVNRL film. Though the cytotoxic and tissue irritative activities of RVNRL are considered much weaker then sulfur-vulcanized latices, it was suggested that RVNRL contains some unknown substances showing weak toxicities including hemolysis.","PUBL WELFARE INST SCI RES,KOGANEI,JAPAN; KANAGAWA PREFECTURAL PUBL HLTH LABS,ASAHI KU,YAKOHAMA,KANAGAWA,JAPAN","TSUCHIYA, T (reprint author), NATL INST HYG SCI,KAMIYOGA 1-18-1,SETAGAYA KU,TOKYO 158,JAPAN.",,,,,,,8,10,10,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0146-5724,,,RADIAT PHYS CHEM,Radiat.

The blood compatibility of the NR-g-DMAA tubes was assessed with three methods, namely in vitro test, ex vivo once through test and ex vivo loops test. In the case of the in vitro test, a simple whole blood contacting procedure has been employed. The ex vivo once through test involves the exposing of NR-g-DMAA tubes with once through flow of fresh canine blood and then it was inspected for any evidence of clot. In the case of ex vivo loops test, the NR-g-DMAA tube was implanted at external jugular vein of a mongrel canine and the blood flow in the NR-g-DMAA tube was detected with an ultrasonic flow meter. It was found that the blood compatibility of NR-g-DMAA tubes is improved significantly with the increasing degree of grafting. All the NR-g-DMAA tubes having a degree of grafting of about 30 wt % or more exhibit good blood compatibility.

As an alternative to adsorption and coating, fluid biomaterials can be replaced by conductive freeze-fracture replica. We give an introduction into the sample preparation of metal-coated specimens and discuss how each step can affect the structural preservation and thereby the quality of the data.

FRP composite fracture behavior and environmental interactions are distinctly different from those which occur in metals. These differences must be accounted for in the design and evaluation of implant performance. Fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength in a FRP composite is known to strongly influence fracture behavior. The interfacial bond strength of four candidate fiber/matrix combinations (carbon fiber/polycarbonate, carbon fiber/polysulfone, polyaramid fiber/polycarbonate, polyaramid fiber/polysulfone) were investigated at 37-degrees-C in dry and in vivo simulated (saline, exudate) environments. Ultimate bond strength was measured by a single fiber-microdroplet pull-out test. Dry bond strengths were significantly decreased following exposure to either saline or exudate with bond strength loss being approximately equal in both the saline and exudate. Bond strength loss is attributed to the diffusion of water and/or salt ions into the sample and their interaction with interfacial bonding. Because bond degradation is dependent upon diffusion, diffusional equilibrium must be obtained in composite test samples before the full effect of the test environment upon composite mechanical behavior can be determined.",,"LATOUR, RA (reprint author), CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOENGN,CLEMSON,SC 29634, USA.",,,,,,,32,20,20,0,2,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The failure of the theory to predict the relationship between fracture toughness and molecular mass found experimentally for glass-ionomers and zinc polycarboxylates is noted. These results, together with others from the wider realm of polymer physics, lead to the conclusion that the attempt to understand the fracture of polyelectrolyte biomaterials in such detailed theoretical terms is probably premature.",,"NICHOLSON, JW (reprint author), LAB GOVT CHEMIST, MAT TECHNOL GRP, QUEENS RD, TEDDINGTON TW11 0LY, MIDDX, ENGLAND.",,"Nicholson, John/B-4784-2012",,,,,13,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Thirty female New-Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into three groups on the basis of the material to be implanted in each side of the mandible: six rabbits received a positive control implant (silicone tubes filled with asbestos) in both sides of the mandible; 12 rabbits received a Sealite implant in the left side and a negative control implant (silicone tubes filled with silicone adhesive) in the right side of the mandible; and 12 rabbits received a silicone tube filled with Pulp Canal Sealer in the left side and a negative control implant in the right side of the mandible. The sealers were implanted in a freshly mixed, unset state. The rabbits were killed 4 or 12 weeks after implantation and the implants and surrounding bone were sectioned and treated in accord with standard histologic procedures. The tissue reactions were scored and rated as none, very slight, slight, moderate, severe, and very severe. The statistical analysis of the data showed that the two sealers had similar, good biocompatibility, and that the reactions observed at the 12-week period were better than those observed at the 4-week period.

The fibroblast is the major cell type; but also giant cells and macrophages are present, and their numbers are increased in the occasional adverse-type host reaction to the prosthesis. Adverse lytic reactions are often associated with methylmethacrylate debris, whereas in cementless cases, polyethylene and metallic (titanium) wear debris seem to cause adverse reactions. Osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal collagenase secreted by fibroblasts and macrophages play an important role in the process of prosthetic loosening. Methylmethacrylate is immunologically relatively inert, while it induces inflammatory mononuclear-cell migration. Both cemented and cementless prostheses cause a foreign-body type host response, including adaptive and reactive processes. This response includes the formation of fibroblast-like B-type lining cells, which are able to synthesize and secrete hyaluronate. Material surfaces of hip arthroplasty components also provide a unique environmental niche to which staphylococcal strains adhere and colonize. Antibiotic resistance is related to the material colonized rather than to the presence of an exopolysaccharide barrier, organisms bound to polyethylene and methylmethacrylate are more resistant than organisms that are bound to stainless steel. An understanding of prosthetic biocompatibility requires an appreciation of tissue cell, bacterial cell and host defense-system response to biomaterials.

STUDY DESIGN: Oxidized regenerated cellulose and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene were inserted into the peritoneal cavity of mice and the peritoneal fluid cell number, differential cell count, morphologic type, adherence to plastic, and phorbol-12, 13-myristate acetate-stimulated hydrogen peroxide production evaluated. Peritoneal fluid cell attachment to oxidized regenerated cellulose and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was evaluated by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly elicited increased numbers of large, morphologically activated peritoneal fluid macrophages that adhered more rapidly and produced more hydrogen peroxide than controls. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene gradually increased the number of normal-appearing peritoneal fluid macrophages with increased hydrogen peroxide production but normal adherence. Macrophages rapidly attached to both materials in vivo, with oxidized regenerated cellulose being rapidly degraded. CONCLUSION: Oxidized regenerated cellulose, to a greater extent than expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, elicits an acute peritoneal fluid inflammatory exudate in the mouse, which may contribute to the oxidized regenerated cellulose-induced peritoneal injury and de novo adhesions observed in this model.",,"HANEY, AF (reprint author), DUKE UNIV, MED CTR, DEPT OBSTET & GYNECOL, DIV REPROD ENDOCRINOL & INFERTIL, BOX 2971, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA.",,,,,,,27,25,25,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0002-9378,1097-6868,,AM J OBSTET GYNECOL,Am.

This has been verified by determining the influence of CPB on the activation of fibrinolysis, complement, leucocytes and the contact phase of coagulation. Fibrinolytic activity was determined by fibrin degradation products (X-FDP's), complement activation by C3a and C5a, leucocyte activation by granulocyte elastase and contact activation by factor XII-like activity (FXIIA). Five patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery using a bubble oxygenator and pulsatile perfusion were studied. X-FDP's rose gradually during CPB and remained elevated. Similar patterns were observed for elastase and FXIIA. In contrast, C3a rose sharply with peak values at 1 1/2-2h of bypass while C5a did not show significant changes during bypass. The data obtained have enabled the establishment of response patterns for parameters in CPB which will provide information relevant to the clinical application of biomaterials.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,WOLFSON CTR,BIOENGN UNIT,106 ROTENROW,GLASGOW G4 0WN,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,GLASGOW ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT CARDIAC SURG,GLASGOW,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,GLASGOW ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT MED,GLASGOW,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,18,9,9,0,0,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

A variation in the percentage of Na2O from 0.9 to 15.0% was balanced by decreasing the SiO2 content of the network. The amounts of all other constituents of the eight-component glasses were kept constant. An attempt was made to incorporate a constant 16.5% K2O into the glass compositions. A total of 13, eight-component precursor powders were obtained by spray-drying followed by calcination and fusion in order to produce the final glass. Three samples of each eight-component glass were dissolved and analysed for each element using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) to obtain bulk chemical compositions. This investigation has clearly shown the content of Na2O begins to limit the K2O content. A Student-Newman-Keuls rank order test (SNK) showed that a significant decrease in the K2O content occurred from 4.2 to 15.0% Na2O. A linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the % K2O with Na2O in the glass (r = -0.925, p < 0.001).

The UHF band is favored from two aspects: the avoidance of thermal runaway and the uniformity of heating inhomogeneous material. Various resonant cavity applicators are considered for efficient and uniform rewarming. The square-aspect TE 111 cylindrical applicator is favored principally because it allows variation of the E-field orientation as required during the warming profile. An appropriate kidney phantom organ is described. It is used to obtain measured values of the overall efficiency of a TE 111 applicator. The efficiency values are found to fall steadily with increasing temperature from 85% at -40-degrees-C to 45% at the phase change, mainly due to the decreasing tan delta-value of the phantom material.","UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT SURG,MRC,MED CRYOBIOL GRP,CAMBRIDGE CB2 2AH,ENGLAND","EVANS, S (reprint author), UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT ENGN,CAMBRIDGE CB2 1PZ,ENGLAND.",,,,Wellcome Trust,,,10,10,11,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394",0018-9294,,,IEEE T BIO-MED ENG,IEEE Trans.

The relative reactivity of these materials toward platelets was: glass < Fibrinogen(Fg)-coatedglass < Fg-coated polyethylene < polyethylene approximately = Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. Interindividual variation is relatively large (coefficient of variation = 35.5 +/- 9.3%), but comparison to intraindividual controls reduces the variability to 14.8 +/- 10.3%, a level which is suitable for economical testing of platelet retention to bio-materials in the presence or absence of drugs.

Lot BSP067 showed soft-segment enrichment at the surface, which is typical of PEU. Lot BSUA001 showed no evidence of either hard- or soft-segment PEU components at the surface. The surface of this lot was completely covered with a nonextractable additive identified as poly(diisopropyl amino ethyl methacrylate).

To develop vascular grafts that resist thrombotic occlusion, a radio frequency glow discharge (RFGD) process was employed to modify the surface of existing graft materials. Ultrathin coatings of RFGD polymers of ethylene (E), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) were deposited on the lumen of Dacron grafts. Surfaces were characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The effect of glow discharge treatments on platelet-graft interactions was evaluated in an ex vivo baboon shunt model. Following placement of an untreated or RFGD-treated graft in the shunt, deposition of 111Indium-labeled platelets was monitored for 60 min by gamma camera imaging. Untreated Dacron rapidly accumulated large numbers of platelets, reaching a plateau in 60 min. HMDS- and TFE-treated Dacron had significantly lower levels of platelet deposition compared to the untreated control. In contrast, the ethylene treatment of Dacron augmented platelet deposition, making it the most platelet-adherent surface studied. In vitro studies were also performed using untreated and RFGD-treated poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) coverslips. ESCA verified that the surface composition of the untreated and RFGD-treated coverslips were virtually identical to their untreated and treated Dacron graft counterparts. Samples were incubated in washed baboon platelet suspensions for 2 h at 37-degrees-C. Platelet adhesion on the untreated PET was relatively high, and many of the platelets had a completely spread morphology. The HMDS and TFE treatment of PET reduced the number of adherent platelets and prevented platelet spreading on the surface. Platelet adhesion and spreading on the ethylene-treated surface was the highest among the four studied. There is a remarkable linear correlation of the ex vivo and in vitro platelet adhesion data.","UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,FL-20,SEATTLE,WA 98195; SCRIPPS CLIN & RES FDN,LA JOLLA,CA 92037",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 33229-04, HL 31469, HL 33229-03]",,,35,19,19,0,4,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Using an accurate and sensitive method to quantify glycocalyx and bacterial adherence, we have demonstrated that the producer of the most glycocalyx also exhibited the highest adherence index, whereas low producers exhibited the least (p < 0.01). Additionally, at various concentrations the high producer had the greater tendency to adhere and grow on stainless steel wires and tubes (p < 0.001). The adherence index, referred as the ratio of tritiated thymidine uptake on wires to colony forming units (CFU), was also the highest in high producers. The adherence index increased as the glycocalyx index increased. It was suggested that glycocalyx production enhanced the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to biomaterials and caused persistent and intractable infections. In short, the glycocalyx index and the adherence index can be reliable indices of biomaterial-centerted infection.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV, COLL MED, DEPT BACTERIOL, TAIPEI, TAIWAN","TSAI, CL (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV, COLL MED, DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG, TAIPEI, TAIWAN.",,,,,,,22,2,2,0,0,OKAYAMA UNIV MED SCHOOL,OKAYAMA,"EDITORIAL OFFICE, ACTA MEDICA OKAYAMA OKAYAMA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2-5-1 SHIKATA-CHO, KITA-KU, OKAYAMA, 700-8558, JAPAN",0386-300X,,,ACTA MED OKAYAMA,Acta Med.

Another important trend in such ""molecular bioengineering"" is to develop, perhaps via computer-aided molecular design, new artificial biomimetic systems by exact placement of functional groups on rigid polymer backbones, cross-linked structures, or macromolecular assemblies. In this way, biocatalytic functioning or biorecognition similar to enzymes and antibodies can be achieved without the inherent instability often encountered with the native biomolecules or assemblies. Perhaps the most exciting trend in biomaterials research and development is the availability of new biomolecules, e.g., via protein engineering and of hardy cells with specific biofunctions and bioresponses that can be tailored to specific medical or biotechnological needs. The wide variety of ways that such biomolecules and cells can be combined with polymeric biomaterials provides tremendously exciting opportunities for the biomaterials scientists and engineers. In addition to these synthetic approaches, new and exciting analytical tools, such as the scanning tunneling microscope and the atomic force microscope, are permitting study on a molecular scale of individual and small clusters of proteins and other biomolecular assemblies on surfaces. Cell attachments and spreading may also be visualized at various depths within the cell using the confocal laser microscope. Such analytical techniques can lead to important new knowledge about biologic interactions with biomaterials and, therefore, to development of even more biocompatible implants and devices. This paper overviews the present state of polymeric biomaterials and highlights the important and exciting opportunities generated by the liaison of these materials with molecular biology.",,"HOFFMAN, AS (reprint author), UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,MOLEC BIOENGN PROGRAM,FL-20,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,,,,,,62,27,29,1,5,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Human peripheral blood neutrophils were incubated with cobalt-base alloy (F-75) or polystyrene beads of a nonphagocytosable size. Respiratory burst activity was studied by measuring superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of cytochrome C. Neutrophils were found to release no more superoxide anion on incubation for up to 3 h with either material in a protein-free medium than controls without foreign material. However, the ability of neutrophils incubated with either biomaterial to subsequently respond to phorbol myristate acetate challenge was decreased (p < 0.05). Chemical analysis of supernatants for the F-75 samples showed a high concentration of cobalt in the medium within 1 h of incubation. Minimal chromium and nickel was detected. No correlation could be demonstrated between metal in solution and the respiratory burst defect in neutrophils. Instead it appears that interaction of cells with either surface was the critical event in altering the response to phorbol myristate acetate. This observed functional defect may play an important role in rendering tissue around implanted biomaterials susceptible to infections.","CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOENGN,CLEMSON,SC 29634; CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,CLEMSON,SC 29634",,,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [5R01 AR39334],,,33,49,50,0,1,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Often these infections are caused by low-virulence organisms or by a mixture of organisms (polymicrobial). In this study two methods were used to quantitate the bacteria which had adhered to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples. The bacteria were eluted from the sample using an ultrasonic cleaner. The number eluted was then counted by colony counts, which determines viable organisms and by particle counting which counts both viable and nonviable organisms. A known adherent strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and a strain of Proteus mirabilis were used. In general the adherence of S. epidermidis was greater than that of Proteus. When the two organisms were used together, there was an alteration in the adherence pattern which generally increased the adherence of Proteus and had no effect or decreased the adherence of S. epidermidis. The use of both quantitation techniques provided important information on the adherence of organisms to PMMA to which gentamicin had been added. It was evident that organisms did adhere to the PMMA plus gentamicin samples but were not viable when eluted. The amount of adherence to PMMA plus gentamicin was similar to that of PMMA alone at 30 min but was markedly decreased at 24 h. There was a considerable dead biofilm mass on the PMMA plus gentamicin samples which might be a significant promoter of late infections by providing a surface attractive to other strains of bacteria.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,20,55,58,0,6,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

New developments in manufacturing biomaterials have encouraged the use of biological and biosynthetic materials for both arterial replacement and bypass procedures. We have analyzed in vivo the process of neovascularization and incorporation of biolized bovine carotid artery (Solco P(R)), a biological material, and the composite of ovine collagen and polyester mesh (Omniflow(R)), a biosynthetic material. The synthetic fabric polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE), which is widely used in cardiovascular surgery, served as control. Using the dorsal skinfold chamber of the Syrian golden hamster as site for implantation (n = 15), angiogenesis and neovascularization were analyzed quantitatively by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy. In each chamber a piece (approximately 1 mm2) of each of the three vascular grafts was implanted. Five days after implantation neovascularization was ascertained in 90% of the Omniflow(R) grafts, while only 40% of the PTFE and 20% of the Solco P(R) implants revealed new ingrowing microvessels. On day 10 the density of newly formed microvessels was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in Omniflow(R) grafts (263.5 +/- 24.1 cm-1) as compared to PTFE (134.2 +/- 20.8 cm-1) and Solco P(R) (153.2 +/- 32.O cm1). In addition, the biosynthetic composite revealed a larger extension of neovascularization into the perigraft tissue, and 12 days after implantation these grafts were most tightly incorporated. Failure of neovascularization of Solco P(R) was associated with remarkable fibrous collagen thickening, Superior neovascularization of Omniflow(R) might be due to the additional loose polyester mesh support of the material and potentially due to prevention of fibrous collagen thickening.","TECH UNIV MUNICH,INST ANAT,W-8000 MUNICH 2,GERMANY","MENGER, MD (reprint author), UNIV MUNICH,INST SURG RES,MARCHIONINISTR 15,W-8000 MUNICH 70,GERMANY.",,,,,,,39,33,33,0,2,GEORG THIEME VERLAG,STUTTGART,"P O BOX 30 11 20, D-70451 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0171-6425,,,THORAC CARDIOV SURG,Thorac.

By counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. The data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. We found, that Ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. The same can be said about the last materials and E. coli. In contrast as well Ca- and P-containing as - free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. Canges of multiplying of S. aureus and Sc. salivarius seldom were observed. It ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. This may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. It is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. Materials with indifferent behavior or low antimicrobiological effect have to be favoured.","UNIV JENA,HALS NASEN OHREN KRANKHEITEN KLIN & POLIKLIN,O-6900 JENA,GERMANY","OEHRING, H (reprint author), UNIV JENA,INST MED MICROBIOL,SEMMELWEISSTR 4,O-6900 JENA,GERMANY.",,,,,,,22,3,3,0,0,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0934-8859,,,ZBL HYG UMWELTMED,Zent.bl.

Principal advantages of SIMS include high detection sensitivity, high depth resolution, isotope specificity, and possibilities for three-dimensional imaging. Current limitations, especially in comparison to X-ray microanalysis, center on lateral spatial resolution and quantification. Recent SIMS instrumentation advances involving field emission liquid metal ion sources and laser post-ionization will help to minimize these limitations in the future. The molecular surface analysis capabilities of static SIMS, especially with the new developments in commercial time-of-flight spectrometers, are promising for application to biomimetic, biomaterials, and biological tissue or cell surfaces. However, the direct microchemical imaging of biomolecules in tissue samples using SIMS will be hindered by limited concentrations, small analytical volumes, and the inefficiencies of converting surface molecules to structurally significant gas phase ions. Indirect detection using elemental or isotopically tagged molecules, however, shows considerable promise for molecular imaging studies using SIMS ion microscopy.",,"LINTON, RW (reprint author), UNIV N CAROLINA, DEPT CHEM, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27599 USA.",,,,,,,210,40,40,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0248-4900,1768-322X,,BIOL CELL,Biol.

By means of inductively coupled plasma analysis, the amount of dissolved silica (Si4+) in water at 37-degrees-C from the calcium phosphate glass depended on the amount of silica in the glasses. The mortality of mice was directly proportional to the silica content of the glass injected intraperitoneally. These results clearly show that the dissolved silica (Si4+) from the glass, monomeric or low molecular silicic anion, is highly toxic.

The commercial expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses Impra(R) and reinforced GORETEX(R) were included as controls on account of their extensive clinical application in the femoropopliteal position. After 5 d incubation at 37-degrees-C biocompatibility was assessed in terms of average area of migrating cells on the biomaterial, total number of cells surrounding the explant and level of adhesion between the cells and the biomaterial. The Vascugraft prosthesis promoted the growth of a continuous monolayer of cells on its surface.

The binding of C3 (central component of complement) and B (factor B, an activator of C3) and H (factor H, an inhibitor of C3 activation) plays a crucial role in the activation of the alternative pathway of complement on the surfaces of biomaterials during extracorporeal procedures. Here we report on the adsorption of C3, B or H on to the silica surface with a hydrophobicity gradient. The amount of native I-125-C3 bound to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was very similar (0.8 and 0.9-mu-g/cm2; 4 x 10(-12) mol/cm2). Neither factor H nor factor B was able to displace already adsorbed I-125-C3 from either of the surfaces. The extent of binding of factors B and H to preadsorbed C3 was a function of the surface hydrophobicity: more I-125-B or I-125-H was bound to C3 adsorbed at the hydrophilic end than at the hydrophobic end of the gradient surface. The binding of I-125-B or I-125-H to preadsorbed C3 appeared to be influenced by the availability of their binding sites on adsorbed C3 molecules rather than by the amount of surface-bound C3. At the hydrophobic end of the gradient surface the molar binding ratio of B/C3 was considerably smaller than the molar binding ratio of H/C3. It can be speculated that the hydrophobicity of the surface determines orientation and/or conformation of adsorbed C3 molecule; when adsorbed at the hydrophobic end of the gradient, C3 molecule predominantly exposes the binding site to which only factor H can bind. A substantial decrease in binding of C3, B or H on to the hydrophobicity gradient surface was observed in the presence of other serum or plasma proteins, particularly at the hydrophobic end of the gradient surface.","UNIV UTAH,DEPT BIOENGN,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112; UNIV UTAH,DEPT PATHOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112; UNIV UTAH,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112; UNIV UTAH,CTR BIOPOLYMERS INTERFACES,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112",,,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI 19319],,,26,35,35,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,8,,,,,497,504,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JC846,WOS:A1992JC84600002,1321678.0,,,,2019-02-25

Platelets were similarly distributed, except on formaldehyde-cross-linked films that exhibited no platelet aggregation. Fibroblasts were in a spreading phase on most collagenous films. However, cytotoxicity was noticed on some aldehyde-cross-linked films. No direct relationship was found between contact angles and platelet-cell attachment.","ST FRANCOIS ASSISES HOSP, INST BIOMAT, 10 ESPINAY, QUEBEC CITY G1L 3L5, QUEBEC, CANADA",,,,,,,,23,29,30,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,9,,,,,612,616,,10.1016/0142-9612(92)90029-N,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JG772,WOS:A1992JG77200006,1391408.0,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of electrostatic forces on the rheology of injectable collagen was studied by observation of the birefringence of collagen fibres through a polarizing microscope as well as by oscillatory rheological measurements on dispersions of varying ionic strengths (0.06-0.30). The birefringence of fibres progressively increased as ionic strength was reduced from 0.30 to 0.06. The linear viscoelastic measurements displayed a logarithmic relationship between storage (and loss) moduli and frequency over oscillation frequencies of 0.1-100 rad/s. The associated relaxation time spectra, interpreted using the theory of Kamphuis et al. for concentrated dispersions, show that collagen fibres become more flexible as ionic strength increases. This result was analysed at the molecular level from the perspective that collagen fibres are a liquid-crystalline phase of rigid rod collagen molecules which have phase-separated from solution. Electrostatic forces affect the volume fraction of water present in the collagen fibres which in turn alters the rigidity of the fibres. Flexible collagen fibre dispersions displayed emulsion-like flow properties whereas more rigid collagen fibre dispersions displayed suspension-like flow properties. Changes in fibre rigidity significantly alter the injectability of collagen dispersions which is critical in clinical performance.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BERKELEY,CA 94720; CELTRIX LABS INC,PALO ALTO,CA 94303","ROSENBLATT, J (reprint author), UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM ENGN,CATONSVILLE,MD 21228, USA.",,,,,,,34,17,17,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,12,,,,,878,886,,10.1016/0142-9612(92)90182-N,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JV211,WOS:A1992JV21100010,1457682.0,,,,2019-02-25

In previous in vitro studies we could discriminate primary, i.e. extractable, and secondary cytotoxicity, due to cell-biomaterial interactions, i.e. enzymatic actions. To develop dermal sheep collagen for clinical applications, we focused in this study on the release, e.g. elimination, of secondary cytotoxicity over time. We used the universal 7 d methylcellulose cell culture with human skin fibroblasts as a test system. Hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen and glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen were tested, with intervals of 6 d, over a culture period of 42 d. With hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, cytotoxicity, i.e. cell growth inhibition and deviant cell morphology, was eliminated after 18 d of exposure. When testing glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, the bulk of cytotoxic products was released after 6 d, but a continuous low secondary cytotoxicity was measured up to 42 d. As a control, non-cross-linked dermal-sheep collagen was tested over a period of 36 d, but no secondary cytotoxic effects were observed. The differences in release of secondary cytotoxicity between hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen and non-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen are explained from differences in cross-linking agents and cross-links obtained. We hypothesize that secondary cytotoxicity results from enzymatic release of pendant molecules from hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, e.g. formed after reaction of hydrolysis products of hexamethylenediisocyanate with dermal sheep collagen. Glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen contains residual cross-linking agents, which induce the bulk cytotoxicity. Apart from being sensitive to enzymatic degradation, glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen was also found to be sensitive to aqueous hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of cross-links may release cytotoxic products and introduce new pendant molecules within glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, which in turn induce cytotoxicity after enzymatic attack.","TWENTE UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM TECHNOL, 7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL, BIOMAT RES SECT, OOSTERSINGEL 69-2, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.",,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,25,64,64,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,14,,,,,1017,1024,,10.1016/0142-9612(92)90153-F,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JY793,WOS:A1992JY79300007,1472588.0,,,,2019-02-25

The phase formation reactions in dependence of the chemical composition and the microstructure are shown. Microstructure of mica glass-ceramics has been studied by electron replica and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques. Mica glass-ceramics have previously been developed in SiO2-B2O3-Al2O3-MgO-F--base glasses. The material is machinable because of the precipitation of micas of fluorophlogopite-type. Also, a machinable glass-ceramic for dental applications was developed based on KMg2.5(Si4O10)F2-micas. We developed mica glass-ceramics in the SiO2-Al2O3-MgO-Na2O-K2O-F glass system. Phase formation within these glasses was observed by SEM. A double controlled nucleation and crystallization of mica and apatite crystals was possible in glasses of the SiO2-MgO-Na2O-K2O-F-CaO-P2O5-(Al2O3) system. The main crystal phases of phlogopite-type were characterized by SEM and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and apatite crystals Ca5(PO4)3(OH,F) were analyzed by X-ray diffraction measurements. The glass-ceramics are useful biomaterials for bone substitution. EDS analysis shows the ion exchange between glass-ceramics and body fluids. The interface reaction is characterized by formation of a small phosphate layer, and particularly by alkali ion exchange.","UNIV JENA,O-6900 JENA,GERMANY","HOLAND, W (reprint author), IVOCLAR AG,BENDERERSTR 2,FL-9494 SCHAAN,LIECHTENSTEIN.",,,,,,,30,11,11,2,9,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1992.0,2.0,2,,,,,105,112,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,JU596,WOS:A1992JU59600002,,,,,2019-02-25

Parameters of cell growth and adhesion were calculated and compared with electron microscopic observations of cell morphology and of the extracellular matrix. Both culture methods provided complementary results and led to a similar classification of the biomaterials. However, the cell culture method exhibited a higher sensitivity to the surface properties of biomaterials which limited further experimentation. This was well illustrated by glutaraldehyde cross-linked protein membranes which did not support the growth of dispersed cells but enabled the formation of a cellular tissue in organ culture, thus allowing a cytocompatibility assessment. Endothelial cell morphology and extracellular matrix elaborated on biomaterials were compared to chicken blood vessels.

Non-absorbable prostheses used to reconstruct abdominal wall defects showed the best results. Polypropylene mesh (PPM) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) soft-tissue patch are the most frequently used materials for this purpose. However, PPM induces extensive visceral adhesions and erosion of the skin, whereas ePTFE is insufficiently anchored to the adjacent tissue and therefore both materials are not ideal. As a result of own clinical and experimental studies, we constructed a new prosthesis that combines the favourable properties and avoids the drawbacks of PPM and ePTFE and tested it in an experimental study in the rat.

Using a digital image analysis system, microradiographic and BSE images from canine cortical and cancellous bone were captured and analyzed. The results of this study showed that microradiography had more projection effect errors associated with the morphology and histometry. The BSE technique provided substantially better resolution of the bone morphology and showed significantly more (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) bone surface perimeter than the microradiographic technique. Contrary to the literature, the BSE images did not show less bone area than the microradiographic images of the identical regions. This discrepancy was explained by projection effect errors and over penetration artifacts of the X-ray beam. Unique to this study was the documentation that microradiography has inherent projection effect errors associated with mineral content measurements. The BSE images had significantly more (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) graylevels present than the microradiographic images. Due to the limited tissue overlap, the BSE images provide excellent morphologic resolution, accurate bone histometry and the ability to accurately measure the mineral content of cortical and cancellous bone at a microscopic level.",,"BACHUS, KN (reprint author), VET ADM MED CTR,BONE & JOINT RES LABS 151F,500 FOOTHILL BLVD,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84148, USA.",,,,,,,78,23,24,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1992.0,2.0,4,,,,,347,355,,,,,,9,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,KP120,WOS:A1992KP12000008,,,,,2019-02-25

The surfactant is first deposited on the polymer surface via a solvent swelling and evaporation method. Then the coated surfactant is immobilized on the substrate surface by an inert gas discharge treatment. ESCA and water contact angle (theta) measurements on treated and solvent washed surfaces show significant increases in both surface O/C ratios and surface water wettability (theta < 30-degrees) compared to LDPE control surfaces, revealing the presence of PEO on the treated surfaces. A great reduction of fibrinogen adsorption on the modified surfaces is also observed for the highest PEO content surfactants.

The thrombus volume in the graft lumen was measured with a computer assisted videometric system. Little thrombus formed by 5 or 10 minutes, but there was less thrombus in the denucleated graft than in the control graft at all times. The differences were statistically significant at 15 and 20 minutes (p < 0.05). Denucleation nearly doubled the thrombus formation time.

We previously developed an in vitro assay to study the Staphylococcus aureus adhesion-promoting effect of surface-adsorbed fibronectin on flat PMMA coverslips coated with a monolayer amount of fibronectin. We screened the potential anti-adhesive properties of a group of substituted dextrans, previously shown to exhibit potent anticoagulant and anticomplementary activities. In comparison to unsubstituted dextran which showed no significant (<20%) adhesion inhibition at 1 mg/ml, dextrans increasingly substituted with carboxylic and benzylamide groups (CMBD) exhibited increasing anti-adhesive activities. Three CMBD derivatives showing an increasing proportion (5-14%) of benzylamide groups showed inhibition of bacterial adhesion increasing from 33 to 51% at 1 mg/ml. Another category of substituted dextrans having a variable proportion (2-26%) of sulfonated benzylamide groups (CMBDS) produced active inhibition of S. aureus adhesion. In comparison to these heparin-like dextran derivatives, native heparin produced inhibition values of S. aureus adhesion which were intermediate between those of CMBD and CMBDS compounds. Further ore, the anti-adhesive activity was still expressed when substituted dextrans were preincubated with fibronectin-coated PMMA but washed away at the time when radiolabeled bacteria were added to the adhesion assay. This indicates that the anti-adhesive effects of CMBDS could be exerted at the level of the S. aureus binding site of fibronectin. In conclusion, S. aureus adhesion on fibronectin-coated biomaterials can be efficiently blocked in vitro by soluble compounds such as dextran derivatives.","UNIV PARIS 13,RECH MACROMOLEC LAB,CNRS,URA 502,F-93430 VILLETANEUSE,FRANCE","VAUDAUX, P (reprint author), HOP CANTONAL GENEVA,DEPT MED,DIV MALAD INFECT,CH-1211 GENEVA 4,SWITZERLAND.",,"Didier, letourneur/H-5268-2012","Didier, letourneur/0000-0003-2197-9468",,,,24,21,21,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Copolymers, SE8.5, is composed of polystyrene with 8.5 mol% of monoamine side chains, and SED8, which is with 8 mol% of diamine side chains, were estimated to contain almost the same amount of protonated amino groups in bulk composition at physiological pH (pH 7.4). There observed significant difference in cellular spreading of attached endothelial cells between these two types of copolymer surfaces. Spreading-% of attached cells on SED8 surfaces was approximately 1.6 times greater than that on SE8.5 6 h after seeding. This difference in cellular spreading influenced to subsequent cell growth. Cellular growth on each polymer surface was featured by parameter k, which corresponds to the 'rate constant' of cellular proliferation. While the k-value for SE8.5 decreased with decreasing seeding density as well as the case for polystyrene, SED8 maintained a high k-value even at low seeding density as 2 x 10(3) cells/cm2.

This was achieved by constructing a novel test chamber permitting the contact of small amounts of blood with a large geometrical test surface. The construction consists of a spiral-shaped flow channel of 0.3 cm width, 0.02 cm height and 78 cm length covered with the biomaterials to be tested from both sides. Laminarity of blood flow in the conduit was confirmed theoretically by the calculation of an equivalent to the Reynolds number for curved systems the so-called Dean number. Furthermore, flow laminarity was proved experimentally finding that the flow rate of blood with different hematocrit values was proportional to the hydrostatic pressure applied. The applicability of the novel 'spiral method' for the estimation of hemocompatibility was demonstrated by evaluation of platelet adhesion onto different polymers in comparison to siliconized and fibrinogen coated glass as reference surfaces. Additionally, it was possible under distinct conditions to determine the adhesion of leucocytes and the detachment of platelet aggregates. Therefore, it was concluded that the spiral method can be used for the assessment of the hemocompatibility of flat biomedical polymers. As main advantages of the new method can be considered the high time efficiency and accuracy without labelling or optical detection of adherent cells.","UNIV SOFIA, FAC CHEM, BU-1126 SOFIA, BULGARIA","GROTH, T (reprint author), HUMBOLDT UNIV, SCH MED, BIOMAT RES UNIT TUCHOLSKYSTR 2, O-1040 BERLIN, GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,30,7,7,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In this study, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) containing various amounts of adrenochrome-melanin were synthesized and the cytotoxicity of their aqueous ""tracts was assessed by using four in vitro testing techniques (trypan blue dye exclusion, inhibition of DNA synthesis, lactate dehydrogenase release, and inhibition of cell growth). Assays were based on incubation with human choroidal fibroblasts. By the first three techniques, no cytotoxicity was found in the extracts. The inhibition of cell growth test showed a slight cellular protein loss, however only in the extracts of polymers with high melanin content. The results suggest that the release of potentially toxic agents from melanized hydrogels into an aqueous medium is not significant. However, when an assay in collagen gel was carried out in the presence of specimens of melanized hydrogels, a toxic reaction was clearly revealed. This can be caused by a delayed release of toxic molecules from melanin, or by some other mechanism.

The inflammatory exsudate contained only 23 +/- 17% of the simultaneous steady state plasma glucose concentration, which was significantly different from the glucose level in the fluid obtained from non-irritate subcutaneous tissue (95 +/- 12%, separate set of experiments). The in vitro calibration of sensors exhibited essentially comparable sensitivities before and after the in vivo application. No differences in reported findings related to the biomaterials used (polyurethane versus cellulose acetate), the presence of diabetes, the history of individual electrodes and the effective duration of a given experiment were discernible. We conclude that the functional bioinstability of subcutaneous glucose sensors is largely due to the inflammatory tissue reaction which alters the effective glucose concentration within the measuring compartment of the electrodes; these drawbacks may be overcome by further miniaturization including implantable telemetric devices allowing the closure of the skin.","UNIV GREIFSWALD,DEPT ANAT,O-2200 GREIFSWALD,GERMANY","REBRIN, K (reprint author), INST DIABET GERHARDT KATSCH,O-2201 KARLSBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,,,42,69,70,0,10,BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0141-5425,,,J BIOMED ENG,J.

Autologous materials are preferred; however, the harvesting procedure, donor site, and its associated morbidity are the disadvantages of using autografts. There are numerous types of alloplastic implants and they all differ in how they interact with host tissues. Factors such as implant texture, ability to integrate with host tissues, and rate of resorption all influence the overall success of different implants. In this article, we discuss some considerations in the use of biologic grafts and alloplastic implants in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.","UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT OTOLARYNGOL HEAD & NECK SURG MC648, CHICAGO, IL 60612 USA",,,,,,,,80,5,5,0,1,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

The most common surgical tissue adhesives available to the surgeon include the cyanoacrylate derivatives and the fibrin tissue adhesives. Butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl(R)) is a cyanoacrylate derivative that is frequently used in Canada and Europe. This adhesive has excellent binding strength for skin closure; however, subcutaneous implantation can result in inflammation and foreign body giant cell reaction. Fibrin tissue adhesives use a fibrin clot as the binding moiety and vary in adhesive strength depending on the fibrinogen concentration of the preparation. Autologous fibrin tissue adhesives are prepared using one of several different methods, which vary in fibrinogen yield and concentration. The currently available autologous fibrin tissue adhesives demonstrate good hemostatic properties with relatively low binding strengths. This article reviews the status of cyanoacrylate adhesives and the preparation, efficacy, and clinical applications of the fibrin tissue adhesives.","UNIV ILLINOIS, COLL MED, DEPT OTOLARYNGOL HEAD & NECK SURG, DIV FACIAL PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG, CHICAGO, IL 60612 USA",,,,,,,,41,27,28,1,7,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Endl.]. Each sample of chips used was subjected to a steam explosion under fixed conditions. The pressure was 28 kgf/cm2, and the treatment temperature 232-degrees-C was kept for 4 min in a closed vessel after the injection of steam. Then, the contents were released explosively into the atmosphere. After the steam explosion, various lignocellulosic samples, before and after the hydrogen peroxiode-alkali treatment, were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with a mixed enzyme solution of commercial Meicelase and Cellulosin AC 40 (1:1, w/v). By comparison of the saccharification ratios (%), the following findings were obtained: 1) Marked differences based on lignocellulosic species characteristic of biomaterials were observed. 2) Lignocellulosic samples such as rice straw, poplar, and maple chips gave enzymatic saccharification ratios (%) close to 100% by using the sample obtained after extractions with various solvents without hydrogen peroxide-alkali treatments. 3) Chip samples, such as Japanese larch, loblolly pine, and Japanese cypress, gave the very low enzymatic saccharification ratios (%) of 20-40% after the steam explosions and extractions with various solvents. 4) In comparison with enzymatic saccharification ratios (%) of original steam-explosion samples, hydrogen peroxide-alkali treatments resulted in greater effect based on the treatment of 2-2.5 times. 5) Hydrogen peroxide-alkali treatments afforded remarkable effects based on the treatments of the softwoods, Japanese larch and loblolly pine.",,"MAEKAWA, E (reprint author), KYOTO UNIV, WOOD RES INST, DIV WOOD BIOMASS SCI, UJI, KYOTO 611, JAPAN.",,,,,,,13,5,5,1,3,JAPAN WOOD RES SOC,TOKYO,"1-1-17, MUKOGAOKA, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0023, JAPAN",0021-4795,1880-7577,,MOKUZAI GAKKAISHI,Mokuzai Gakkaishi,,1992.0,38.0,5,,,,,522,527,,,,,,6,"Materials Science, Paper & Wood",Materials Science,JE438,WOS:A1992JE43800014,,,,,2019-02-25

Type I-A bioerodible matrices reported in the past degrade either too slowly or too rapidly. The rate of erosion, therefore, has no influence on the kinetics of release. This paper reports kinetics of release of theophylline from a series of crosslinked glassy/swollen hydrogel matrices based on a novel crosslinking monomer, viz. 2-hydroxyethyl glycolate dimethacrylate. The release of theophylline in an alkaline medium is accompanied by the erosion of the crosslinks. Under appropriate conditions, theophylline is released at a constant rate by the erosion of the crosslinks in the bulk of the swollen polymer as well as by the surface erosion of the glassy polymer. The release behaviour has been explained on the basis of the concept of time-dependent diffusivity of the active ingredient and swelling-controlled zero-order release, respectively.","NATL CHEM LAB,DIV CHEM ENGN,POLYMER SCI & ENGN GRP,POONA 411008,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA",,,,,,,,20,13,13,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0032-3861,,,POLYMER,Polymer,,1992.0,33.0,3,,,,,593,599,,10.1016/0032-3861(92)90737-H,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,HD394,WOS:A1992HD39400019,,,,,2019-02-25

The conditions at which the graft polymerization proceeded with a suitable yield were determined. Ammonium ferrous sulphate (Mohr's salt), as an inhibitor, failed to inhibit the homopolymerization of NVP during the radiation grafting process. In contrast, the addition of Cu2Cl2 (0.5 wt%) effectively inhibited the homopolymerization process and smooth grafted films with suitable grafting yield were obtained. The grafting onto PFA films, which scarcely swell in any solvent or monomer, was critically controlled by the diffusivity of reactants through the grafted layers initially formed near the film surface. The addition of ZnCl2 (3 wt%) to the monomer solution slightly enhanced the grafting and much smoother grafted films were obtained. The dependence of initial rate of grafting on NVP concentration was of the order 0.54. The graft copolymer possessed good mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical stability. Such non-ionic supported hydrogel on fluorinated polymer may be of interest for some practical use in which high electrical conductivity is not required, as in biomaterials.","AIN SHAMS UNIV,COLL WOMEN,CAIRO,EGYPT","HEGAZY, ESA (reprint author), NATL CTR RADIAT RES & TECHNOL,POB 29,CAIRO,EGYPT.",,,,,,,20,15,15,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0032-3861,,,POLYMER,Polymer,,1992.0,33.0,20,,,,,4230,4235,,10.1016/0032-3861(92)90262-U,,,,6,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JU316,WOS:A1992JU31600002,,,,,2019-02-25

This Bioregister is a so-called ""spontaneous"" ad hoc recording system whose efficiency depends largely on the collaboration of physicians. Thus, the efficiency and rationality of the use of biomaterials can certainly be improved.

The putative enhancement of glutaraldehyde crosslinking by lysine was investigated in three model systems: bovine pericardium, collagen membranes, and bovine serum albumin. Repetitive sequential treatment of bovine pericardium with glutaraldehyde and lysine and finally with formaldehyde produced a matrix which, by the two criteria used (shrinkage temperature and urea/SDS soluble collagen), was shown to be more highly crosslinked than pericardium fixed in glutaraldehyde alone. Essentially the same results were obtained when membranes prepared from pepsin-soluble pericardial collagen were subjected to sequential glutaraldehyde and lysine treatments, reaching shrinkage temperatures of more than 90-degrees-C. Heart valves prepared from lysine-enhanced glutaraldehyde crosslinked bovine pericardium were tested in vitro in an accelerated fatigue tester and have been shown to behave satisfactorily after 300 million cycles. These additional crosslinks proved to be stable in saline at 37-degrees-C. Studies on bovine serum albumin attempted to get an insight into the mechanisms of lysine enhancement of glutaraldehyde crosslinking by treating sequentially albumin with glutaraldehyde and lysine and analysis of the products by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. These studies suggest that free amino groups exposed by proteins are initially reacted with glutaraldehyde and then bridged by the diamino compound (lysine) producing more extensive intermolecular crosslinking than glutaraldehyde alone.","ACAD MED SCI, MED RES CTR, CARDIOVASC SURG RES DEPT, POB 118-4300, Targu Mures, ROMANIA",,,,,,,,24,42,42,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

In this study different molecular weight PEO molecules were covalently attached to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films using cyanuric chloride chemistry. Prior to the PEO immobilization, amino groups were introduced onto the PET films by exposing them to an allylamine plasma glow discharge. The amino groups on the PET film were next activated with cyanuric chloride and then reacted with bis-amino PEO. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, water contact angle measurements, gravimetric analysis, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The adsorption of I-125-labeled baboon fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin was studied from buffer solutions. Gravimetric analysis indicated that the films grafted with the low-molecular-weight PEO contained many more PEO molecules than the surfaces grafted with higher-molecular-weight PEO. The high-molecular-weight PEO surfaces, however, exhibited greater wettability (lower water contact angles) and less protein adsorption than the low-molecular-weight PEO surfaces. Adsorption of albumin and fibrinogen to the PEO surfaces decreased with increasing PEO molecular weight up to 3500. A further increase in molecular weight resulted in only slight decreases in protein adsorption. Protein adsorption studies as a function of buffer ionic strength suggest that there may be an ionic interaction between the protein and the allylamine surface. The trends in protein adsorption together with the water contact angle results and the gravimetric analysis suggest that a kind of ""cooperative"" water structuring around the larger PEO molecules may create an ""excluded volume"" of the hydrated polymer coils. This may be an important factor contributing to the observed low protein adsorption behavior.","UNIV WASHINGTON, CTR BIOENGN, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,48,475,480,3,107,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Bacterial adhesion was generally reduced by the presence of protein during the adherence assay except in the case of bovine pericardium, in which adherence remained almost unaffected. The effect of these plasma proteins on bacterial surface properties resulted in strong increases of surface charge as measured by ion-exchange chromatography and with no effect on hydrophobicity, estimated as contact angles. Adherence was not found to be correlated with these two properties, suggesting that bacteria-surface interactions must not be simplified to the influence of interfacial forces.","FAC FARM SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,DEPT MICROBIOL & PARASITOL,E-15706 SANTIAGO,SPAIN",,,"Carballo, Julia/K-9953-2014","Carballo, Julia/0000-0003-4388-358X",,,,27,7,7,1,4,REV ESPANOLA FISIOLOGIA,PAMPLONA,"APARTADO 177, 31080 PAMPLONA, SPAIN",0034-9402,,,REV ESP FISIOL,Rev.

The hydrogel was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde using MgCl2 (water based) or toluenesulfonic acid (DMSO based) as the acid catalyst. The water-based gel was stiffer (compression modulus of 465 kPa) than the DMSO gel (compression modulus of 48.6 +/- 2.4 kPa). The terminal hydroxyl group of PEG (M(n) 2000 and 5000, with or without a monomethoxy end cap) was oxidized to an aldehyde by using an acetic anhydride-DMSO mixture or modified with a diisocyanatohexane to produce a terminal isocyanate. Optimum conversion to an aldehyde was realized at 8 h at room temperature, independent of molecular weight. Maximum conversion to the isocyanate occurred at 6 and 10 h/90-degrees-C for M(n) 2000 and 5000, respectively. Using the aldehyde-terminated PEG5000 in the presence of toluenesulfonic acid, XPS analysis of the immobilized product determined that an average maximum oxyethylene content of 71% was obtained after 4 h at 70-degrees-C. Both molecular weight species of poly(ethylene glycol isocyanate) were bound to PVA on the order of 74% oxyethylene content as measured by XPS. Covalent binding of PEG M(n) 5000 via an aldehyde had no effect on the advancing contact angle whereas immobilization through a urethane moiety resulted in a significant decrease, indicating that PEG dominated this surface in air. Since receding contact angles indicated total wetting of both modified and unmodified PVA surfaces, it was not possible to distinguish the presence of PEG from that of PVA on the surface of the gel in water. These surfaces are of potential interest as a means of reducing the thrombogenicity of cardiovascular biomaterials.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA; UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA",,,,,,,,35,41,43,0,39,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,NOV 11,1991.0,24.0,23,,,,,6065,6072,,10.1021/ma00023a003,,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,GQ428,WOS:A1991GQ42800003,,,,,2019-02-25

In chambers made of pure titanium, the number of leucocytes increased about twofold from 1.8 x 10(6)/ml to 4.1 x 10(6)/ml between 24 h and 6 d, whereas a larger increase from 2.1 x 10(6)/ml to 8.3 x 10(6)/ml was observed in the polytetrafluorethylene chambers. Irrespective of implant material, polymorphonuclear granulocytes constituted the vast majority of leucocytes (> 81%). After 24 h the leukotriene B4 content was slightly higher in polytetrafluorethylene chambers than in titanium chambers. In contrast to the titanium chambers, a marked increase in leukotriene B4 levels was detected in polytetrafluorethylene chambers 6 d after insertion, whereas the greatest amount of leukotriene B4 in titanium chambers was measured at 9 d. Interleukin 1 was only detected in both types of chambers after 6 d. The present study, together with previous findings, shows that the materials used in this study elicit different degrees of inflammatory reactions in the chamber exudate. Since the number of leucocytes in the exudate retrieved from the chambers correlated well with the leukotriene B4 levels, it is suggested that leukotriene B4, but not interleukin 1, may be an important mediator for polymorphonuclear granulocyte migration into the implant-tissue interface. The role of leukotriene B4 and interleukin 1 for other parts of the inflammatory process around biomaterials in soft tissue, such as cell adhesion and activation and microvascular changes and their potential roles for the development of the peri-implant tissue remains to be established.","GOTHENBURG UNIV,DEPT ANAT,POB 33031,S-40033 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN",,,,"Thomsen, Peter/0000-0003-3910-6665",,,,21,19,19,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,NOV,1991.0,12.0,9,,,,,827,830,,10.1016/0142-9612(91)90069-M,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,GT183,WOS:A1991GT18300006,1662545.0,,,,2019-02-25

In acidic pH regions, the swelling equilibria were found to be stable over 200 d. In alkaline pH environments, however, the 'equilibrium' swelling increases slowly with time. Gas chromatography of the supernatant shows that substantial methanol is produced, along with trace amounts of N,N-dimethylethylene diamine. Thus, the primary mechanism underlying the structural changes appears to be hydrolysis of ester groups in the MMA side-chains, with a much smaller contribution due to amidolysis of the DMAA side-chains.

Adhesion of causative bacteria to biomaterials is considered to be an essential step in these infections. We and others have shown that adhesion of CoNS to biomaterials may be mediated by protease-sensitive surface constituents. In the present study we expanded on these investigations by characterizing a biomaterial adhesin of Staphylococcus epidermidis 354 by using a strain-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 36.4). MAb 36.4 was strongly and exclusively reactive with strain 354 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which whole bacteria were used as antigens. Immunoblotting of cell wall polypeptides of strain 354 revealed strong reactivity with a 200- to 220-kDa band and a weaker reaction in the 100- to 110-kDa range. Preincubation of strain 354 with MAb 36.4 resulted in a 54 to 91% (mean +/- standard deviation, 74% +/- 14%; n = 10) inhibition of adhesion to polystyrene spheres. Fab fragments prepared from MAb 36.4 also inhibited adhesion effectively, indicating specific blocking of an adhesion antigen rather than aspecific inhibition. Immunogold electron microscopy with MAb 36.4 revealed deposition of gold particles on the cell surface and possibly also on fimbrialike surface projections. It is concluded that a surface-located protein antigen of S. epidermidis 354 recognized by MAb 36.4 acts as an adhesin mediating attachment to uncoated foreign material. It is speculated that this type of adhesion to biomaterials may play an important role in the pathogenesis of foreign body-related infections caused by CoNS.","STATE UNIV UTRECHT,EIJKMAN WINKLER LAB MED MICROBIOL,HEIDELBERGLAAN 100,3584 CH UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; STATE UNIV UTRECHT,DEPT MOLEC CELL BIOL,UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; UNIV CHILDRENS HOSP HET WILHELMINA KINDERZIEKENHUIS,3512 LK UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; BRETONNEAU HOSP,DEPT INFECT DIS,F-37044 TOURS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,33,84,84,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

On all materials, protein adsorption was detected and included identification of albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, fibronectin, Hageman factor (factor XII), factor VIII/von Willebrand factor, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and the complement protein C5. The amount of protein adsorbed decreased with an increase in the MPC composition and appeared to adsorb to the surfaces in a uniform and evenly distributed manner. Therefore, we suggest that MPC moieties play an important role in suppression of protein adsorption. From these findings, it is concluded that the reduction of protein adsorption at the blood contacting surface of phospholipid polymers may result in the inhibition of thrombus formation.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL,2085 ADELBERT RD,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; TOKYO MED & DENT UNIV,INST MED & DENT ENGN,TOKYO 101,JAPAN; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-33849],,,34,366,370,6,73,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The customary approach to evaluating the role of this force, comparison of protein adsorption to a spectrum of solid surfaces spanning a range of hydrophobicities, is limited by incomplete control over surface chemical variables other than the overall hydrophobicity. We evaluate the importance of the hydrophobic interaction in protein adsorption, while maintaining constant surface properties, by addition of alcohols known to modulate the strength of the hydrophobic interaction in aqueous solutions. The responses of adsorption isotherms, dynamics, and lateral mobility of adsorbed proteins to changes in solvent composition demonstrate the primary role of the hydrophobic interaction in the adsorption of ribonuclease A to polystyrene surfaces. Manipulating the magnitude of the hydrophobic interaction alters the adsorption mechanism through both fluid-phase transport and protein binding at the interface.","STANFORD UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305",,,"Tilton, Robert/A-8267-2009","Tilton, Robert/0000-0002-6535-9415",,,,50,94,96,2,16,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,NOV,1991.0,7.0,11,,,,,2710,2718,,10.1021/la00059a051,,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,GQ894,WOS:A1991GQ89400054,,,,,2019-02-25

The transition temperature itself is about that of the observed linear polymer lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Producing gels from increasingly hydrophilic cellulose ethers raises the transition temperature and increases the swelling degree at comparable crosslink densities. However, decreasing crosslinking has little effect on swelling above the transition temperature. In contrast, increasing ionic content increases swelling at all temperatures. The transition temperature is not affected by the degree of crosslinking, but increases with increasing ionic content. The volume transition of the hydroxypropyl cellulose gel is significantly sharper than for the other gels. Crosslinking and ionic content have little effect on transition sharpness.

In this study, a convenient and reliable test method to assess the fracture toughness of this metal/ceramic interface was developed by modifying an existing homogeneous short-bar configuration. Additionally, conventional tensile adhesive bond strength testing was conducted. For the alumina-coated Ti-6Al-4V model system studied, an interface toughness value of 1.84 +/- 0.20 MPa m1/2 was obtained. An interfacial tensile bond strength of 13.6 +/- 2.9 MPa was also measured for this system. Further refinement of this modified short bar technique taking into account experimental compliance behaviour and potential complex or mixed-mode stress intensities is needed to confirm these preliminary toughness values, which nevertheless offer a potentially more sensitive means of monitoring the mechanical integrity of this metal/ceramic interface.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT MET & MAT SCI, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA","FILIAGGI, MJ (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA.",,,"Filiaggi, Mark/0000-0003-4374-1733",,,,45,15,15,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

To examine the basis for these observations, 1 X 1-cm pieces of biomaterials were sewn onto the peritoneal cavity of rats. The biomaterials examined included PGA mesh, a composite mesh composed of a permanent nonabsorbable Novafil inner layer coated with a PGA outer layer, polyvinyl alcohol sponge, and silicon elastomer. Biomaterials were, removed at postoperative days 1, 2, 8, and 14, and examined for bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity by standard techniques. Mesh adherent leukocytes were evaluated for their ability to oxidize dichloro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), which is fluorescent in the presence of intracellular hydrogen peroxide produced by both polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes. PGA and the composite mesh had no intrinsic bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity. However, adherent leukocytes were induced to oxidize DCFH at levels 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively, by postoperative day 14, compared with earlier time points and other biomaterials.

Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory agent, acts on macrophages to decrease production of inflammatory mediators, and on mast cells to prevent degranulation. Systemic administration of dexamethasone (dms) in rats decreases the tissue reaction to intraperitoneally implanted vinyl chloride-acrylic copolymer capsules. Local release of even smaller amounts of dms from a polymeric substrate placed inside an acrylic copolymer capsule may control the tissue reaction while avoiding the undesirable side effects of systemic treatment. Such a system also allows investigation of the local effect of soluble molecules on tissue-material interactions without altering the surface properties of the implant or adding the effect of a releasing material. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dms released from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVAc) rods placed in acrylic copolymer capsules and implanted in the peritoneal cavity of rats. In vitro the release of dms from EVAc rods was quasilinear for 5 weeks. When implanted intraperitoneally into rats, polymer capsules containing EVAc/dms rods generated a tissue reaction that was significantly thinner and featured fewer fibroblast and collagen layers than that around capsules containing pure EVAc rods at all time points studied. The tissue reaction layer was also thinner than that previously described in rats treated systemically with dms. The trabeculae of implants with dms-loaded EVAc rods contained significantly more intact mast cells than implants with EVAc alone, suggesting that degranulation of mast cells is involved in the tissue reaction to intraperitoneal polymer implants.","BROWN UNIV,ARTIFICIAL ORGAN LAB,PROVIDENCE,RI 02912",,,"Aebischer, Patrick/E-1387-2013",,,,,26,18,18,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

When partially cationized cellulose was used under suitable conditions for heparin enrichment and additionally four different crosslinking reagents and different reaction steps were applied and compared with non-cationized cellulose, the ionic fixation of heparin was ten to fifty times higher compared with non-cationized cellulose. When tested with blood partially cationized cellulose showed a high platelet adhesion whereas endothelial-cell-surface-heparansulfate (ES-HS), isolated from bovine aorta and immobilized on partially cationized cellulose, was completely inert to platelet adhesion measured in a modified Baumgartner chamber. The latter result seems to give a new promising concept for the synthesis of biomaterials, e.g. membranes with nonthrombogenic surfaces similar to surfaces of blood vessels in nature because the isolation procedure of ES-HS and immobilization of ES-HS on polymer surfaces does not change the inertness of ES-HS to platelet adhesion.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, CHEM & PATHOBIOCHEM KLIN, W-5100 AACHEN, GERMANY","BAUMANN, H (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, WORRINGERWEG 1, W-5100 AACHEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,42,13,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

These issues included the mechanisms by which implant materials are released to the surrounding tissues and the ways in which these tissues respond to implant materials. The problem of bone loss around cement-less implants was discussed as a specific example of a biologic effect resulting in both bone remodelling and endosteal erosion.","HOSP SPECIAL SURG, DEPT BIOMECH, 535 E 70TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA; RUSH PRESBYTERIAN ST LUKES MED CTR, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, CHICAGO, IL 60612 USA; UNIV ALABAMA, DEPT BIOMAT, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA; BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA",,,,"Spector, Myron/0000-0003-3328-4858",,,,108,155,161,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0736-0266,1554-527X,,J ORTHOP RES,J.

Direct quantitative methods utilise either measurements of the physical characteristics of the coated surface (equipment necessary for this is not always available), or measurements of radiolabelled protein. We demonstrate that proteins labelled with I-125 using chloramine-T contain a significant proportion of I-125 label which is unable to adsorb to polyvinyl microtitre wells. This non-bindable label is not separable from protein by fractionation on Sephadex G-25 but does dissociate upon SDS gel electrophoresis. The proportion of non-adsorbable label increases with storage time at -70-degrees-C, the effect being accelerated at higher temperatures. A method is described for estimating protein adsorption which is both independent of the non adsorbable fraction but can also be used to estimate it.

Two fluorescent dyes of particular value for vital fluorescence studies are Rhodamine-123 and 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL). We examined the toxicity of these two dyes and of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent used in Rhodamine-123 studies, on the growth of MRC5 human fetal fibroblasts in monolayer culture. Two parameters of cell growth were quantitated: Cell number (a measure of proliferation), and cell area (a measure of cell spreading), based on microscopic images obtained at the start and end of a 48-h growth period after brief exposure (0.5 h) to test solutions. We found that the recommended solvent for solubilization of Rhodamine-123, DMSO, caused cessation of cell proliferation and actual reduction in the area covered by adherent fibroblasts at concentrations of as low as 0.1% (vol:vol). Rhodamine-123 made up from an aqueous stock solution modestly retarded proliferation and spreading, and there was no significant effect of DiI-LDL on these parameters over prolonged periods of exposure (up to 24 h) in culture. These results demonstrate that the most toxic substance for growing fibroblasts was the solvent DMSO. We conclude that both the solvent vehicle and fluorescent dye should be carefully examined for potential toxicity before such dyes are used for vital fluorescence studies of living cells.","BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT PATHOL,75 FRANCIS ST,BOSTON,MA 02115; BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02115",,,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [DK-39512]; NCRR NIH HHS [BRSG 807 RR05950],,,31,17,17,0,2,SOC IN VITRO BIOLOGY,COLUMBIA,"8815 CENTRE PARK DRIVE SUITE 210, COLUMBIA, MD 21045",0073-5655,,,IN VITRO CELL DEV B,,AUG,1991.0,27.0,8,,,,,633,638,,,,,,6,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,GG585,WOS:A1991GG58500008,1917780.0,,,,2019-02-25

The accuracy of stress and strain field measurements has been assessed by finite element analysis of a biaxially-loaded isotropic elastic membrane.

Other prostheses composed of tissue-derived and polymeric biomaterials also are complicated by deposition of mineral. We have previously demonstrated that: (a) Failure due to calcification of clinical bioprosthetic valves can be simulated by either a large animal circulatory model or subdermal implants in rodents. (b) Calcification of bioprosthetic tissue has complex host, implant, and mechanical determinants. (c) The initial calcification event in the rat subdermal model is the mineral deposition in devitalized cells intrinsic to the bioprosthetic tissue within 48 to 72 h, followed later by collagen mineralization. (d) Initiation of bioprosthetic tissue mineralization, like that of physiological bone formation, has ""matrix vesicles"" as early nucleation sites. (e) Alkaline phosphatase (AP), an enzyme also associated with matrix vesicles involved in bone mineral nucleation, is present in both fresh and fixed bioprosthetic tissue at sites of initial mineralization. (f) Certain inhibitors of bioprosthetic tissue calcification (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+) are localized to the sites at which alkaline phosphatase is present. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that alkaline phosphatase is a key element in the pathogenesis of mineralization of bioprosthetic tissue. In the present studies, we focused on the relationship of AP to early events in calcification, and the inhibition of both calcification and AP activity by FeCl3 and AlCl3 preincubations. Subdermal implants of glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium (GPBP) were done in 3-week-old rats. AP was characterized by enzymatic hydrolysis of paranitrophenyl phosphate (pnpp), and by histochemical studies. Calcification was evaluated chemically (by atomic adsorption spectroscopy) and morphologically (by light microscopy). The results of these studies are as follows: (a) Extractable AP activity is present in fresh but not glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardial tissue. However, histochemical studies reveal active AP within the intrinsic devitalized cells of GPBP, despite extended glutaraldehyde incubation. (b) Extrinsic AP is rapidly adsorbed following implantation, with peak activity at 72 h (424 +/- 67.2 nm pnpp/mg protein/ min enzyme activity [units]), but markedly lesser amounts at 21 days (96.8 +/- 3.9 units). (c) Simultaneously to the AP activity maximum, bulk calcification is initiated, with GPBP calcium levels rising from 1.2 +/- 0.1 (unimplanted) to 2.4 +/-0.2-mu-g/mg at 72 h, to 55.6 +/- 3.1-mu-g/mg at 21 days, despite a marked decline in AP activity at this later time. (d) Preincubation of GPBP in either FeCl3 or AlCl3, at concentrations (0.1 M) which inhibited GPBP calcification, significantly reduce AP activity. We conclude that endogenous AP activity is present but not extractable in unimplanted GPBP fixed for extended periods. However, concurrent with the time of the onset of GPBP calcification in the rat subdermal model, AP adsorbed following implantation rises sharply to a maximum, thereby augmenting intrinsic enzyme. Preincubations of GPBP in either AlCl3 or FeCl3 not only prevent calcification, but also result in reduction in AP activity. These results strongly suggest that AP is an important cofactor in the mechanism of bioprosthetic valve mineralization and may be a fruitful target for anticalcification treatments.","BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT PATHOL,BOSTON,MA 02115; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115","LEVY, RJ (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT PEDIAT,R5014 KRESGE IT 0576,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",,,,,,,83,67,71,0,5,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

By embedding parabens in PU by the solvent-cast method, matrices with amorphous dispersions (or solid solutions) were obtained. Release rate modulation was achieved by using different MW parabens and by a rate-limiting membrane.

For the system poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-dextran-water these novel physical pictures are based on the observation that a transition occurs in the nature of the top PEO-rich phase, from the dilute to the semidilute polymer solution regimes, with increasing PEO molecular weight. In systems containing low molecular weight PEO (M < 10 000 Da), individual polymer coils, which may be larger or smaller than the proteins, interact with the proteins. Mathematically simple geometric and scaling arguments are used to probe the qualitative form of the free-energy change arising from polymer-protein and polymer-polymer interactions within each picture. Through a statistical thermodynamic framework, used to relate the change in free energy to the experimentally measurable protein partition coefficient, K(p), it is possible to discriminate between the novel physical pictures on the basis of the predicted qualitative trends. At THETA-solvent conditions for the polymer, a picture that incorporates solely the excluded-volume interactions between the proteins and the polymer coils is unable to account for the influence of polymer molecular weight on K(p); at athermal-solvent conditions, where repulsive polymer-polymer interactions also influence the protein chemical potential, the predicted protein partition coefficient is shifted in a direction qualitatively consistent with experimental trends. For both athermal- and THETA-solvent conditions, the observed change in K(p) is found to be qualitatively consistent with the presence of a weak attraction between the polymer coils and the proteins. The presence of a strong attraction between the polymer coils and the proteins, and associated formation of an adsorbed polymer layer at the surface of the proteins, can lead to a new partitioning behavior that has not yet been realized experimentally. In systems containing high molecular weight PEO (M >> 10 000 Da), the proteins interact with an entangled polymer network rather than with identifiable polymer coils, and the protein partition coefficient becomes independent of the PEO molecular weight.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,,,,,,73,84,86,1,21,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 22,1991.0,24.0,15,,,,,4334,4348,,10.1021/ma00015a015,,,,15,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FY047,WOS:A1991FY04700015,,,,,2019-02-25

Liquid culture systems may detect cytotoxicity of a material either by culture of cells with extracts or with the material itself. In the latter instance, renewing the medium will remove possible released cytotoxic products. The agar-overlay test is a short term semi-solid culture system in which the possible cytotoxicity of biomaterials is identified only by the presence of cell free zones. The aim of this study was to develop a more sensitive cytotoxicity test system for biomaterials, using methylcellulose as a culture gel, mixed with human fibroblasts. The main advantage of the test system is the possibility of evaluating cytotoxicity for a period of up to seven days without renewal of the culture gel. Furthermore it is possible to both quantitatively evaluate by counting absolute cell numbers and to qualitatively evaluate by studying cell morphology with light- and/or electron microscopy. Processed dermal sheep collagen was selected as test material, since contradictory results concerning the cytotoxicity of its extracts have been reported by others [2, 15, 18, 19]. Using our test system, both primary and secondary cytotoxic effects were found. Primary cytotoxicity is due to direct leakage of products from the material, detected by testing, extracts of the collagen or the collagen itself. Secondary cytotoxicity is due to release of cytotoxic products resulting from cell-biomaterial interactions. We conclude that our test system is extremely useful to test materials which are suspected of primary and/or secondary cytotoxicity, either with slow release of cytotoxic products or release of products with late cytotoxic effects.",,"VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,0,25,25,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The present study evaluates the effect of an atherogenic diet on macrophage/biomaterial interactions. Female New Zealand white rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from these as well as rabbits fed a normal diet and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium with platelet-poor serum. Dacron or polyglactin 910 were added to two of three conditions of both cell groups in passage 2. Conditioned media were collected weekly through week 15. Mitogenicity assays were performed with quiescent mouse embryonal (BALB/c3T3) fibroblasts, atherosclerotic rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells, and murine capillary lung (LE-II) endothelial cells. Mitogenic activity was assayed by scintillation counting of tritiated thymidine incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Results showed increased mitogenic activity released by macrophages from atherosclerotic rabbits, in the absence of prosthetic material, when assayed against every cell line. In normal diet macrophages, polyglactin 910 stimulated mitogen release for every cell line, and Dacron yielded minimal mitogen release. In lipid diet macrophages polyglactin 910 slightly increased mitogen release for all three cell lines, whereas Dacron resulted in stimulation of DNA synthesis in smooth muscle cells and BALB/c3T3 cells but less DNA synthesis in LE-II cells than in control, no graft material, media. Western blotting demonstrated immunoreactivity to basic fibroblast growth factor in media from normal diet macrophages but only in the presence of polyglactin 910 or Dacron. Radioimmunoassay for platelet-derived growth factor B chain was negative in all groups, and polymerase chain reaction techniques to amplify transforming growth factor-beta messenger ribonucleic was negative. These data demonstrate the effect of in vivo dietary manipulation on macrophage activation as well as the effect of an atherogenic diet in modulating macrophage/biomaterial interactions. Additionally, different biomaterials differentially induce macrophages to release factors that stimulate and inhibit growth.","VET ADM MED CTR,HINES,IL 60141; ST BARNABAS HOSP,LIVINGSTON,NJ 07039; AMER RED CROSS,ROCKVILLE,MD","GREISLER, HP (reprint author), LOYOLA UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT SURG,2160 S 1ST AVE,MAYWOOD,IL 60153, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL41272],,,28,14,15,0,0,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

The reply rates were about 80% and 83%. In both surveys, about one half of the personnel reported occupation-related health complaints, a majority of which were dermatoses of hands and fingers. The dermatoses were attributed to seasonal air quality problems, or to contact with chemically active substances relevant to hygienic measures, treatment patterns, or other activities connected with the running of a dental clinic. The majority of the dermatoses were probably irritative. Some presumably hypersensitivity reactions occurred after handling of dental materials. Latex gloves, which were in general use only at the time of the last survey, seemed to have prevented some dermatoses formerly attributed to handwashing procedures. However, latex gloves per se had also induced dermatoses. Non-dermatological ailments of a transient nature comprised eye, respiratory, or systemic reactions and were connected with volatiles from X-ray liquids, methylmethacrylate monomer, and disinfectants. Adverse patient reactions occurred at a frequency of about one per 2600 treated patients. The observations comprised skin reactions (head/face), gingival/mucosal ulcerations, and sometimes systemic/urticarial reactions. The reactions were associated with the use of local anesthetics, orthodontic appliances, and other biomaterials.

Beginning as a research thrust, which led to courses at a few universities, biomaterials education has evolved into distinct curriculum in over 60 institutions in the United States and Canada alone. Rapid growth, however, can cause problems. In an effort to determine the present status and future needs in each sector, as well as begin to assess if the needs of industry are being met by present academic programs, two surveys were sent out. As shown by the two surveys, academic programs have been increasing in both size and quality while industry has also been expanding, as indicated by the many small companies involved in biomaterials. The shift toward graduate programs is in keeping with the perceived educational needs of potential employers. The majority of academic programs appear to be providing the training and coursework desired by employers. Further information, however, is needed to determine if the number of graduates trained in biomaterials is adequate, or in fact excessive. It is, therefore, recommended that a more comprehensive survey, sent to the biomaterials companies listed in the FDA registry, be undertaken. In addition, a survey to each academic program that addresses hiring of recent graduates would also be beneficial. It does appear that certain standards for curricula could be agreed upon, although the field has probably not evolved sufficiently for accreditation or professional registration to be addressed yet.","ONCOGEN,SEATTLE,WA","FELDMAN, DS (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA,SCH ENGN,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,BUSINESS ENGN COMPLEX,ROOM 256,UAB STN,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294, USA.",,,,,,,4,3,3,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",1045-4861,,,J APPL BIOMATER,J.

The lowest values of adherence were observed with polyurethane and Vialon(R) for the staphylococci but with Teflon(R) for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. None of the eluates affected the viability of the staphylococci. However, all of them, significantly increased the growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa with the exception of the eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced to an undetectable level for E. coli. We conclude that bacterial adherence to catheters may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that certain substances eluted from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different micro-organisms.","UNIV SEVILLE,SCH MED,DEPT MICROBIOL,APDO 914,E-41080 SEVILLE,SPAIN",,,"Pascual, Alvaro/Y-5854-2018","Pascual, Alvaro/0000-0002-8672-5891",,,,13,55,57,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0022-2615,,,J MED MICROBIOL,J.

Validation of the model was evaluated by examining the calcification of both highly calcifiable biomaterial (bioprosthetic tissue) and a non-calcifiable biomaterial (charge-modified tissue and polyurethane containing anticalcification agent).

The PU-FBNG material was processed through a spraying, phase-inversion technique to fabricate porous tubular conduits. FBNG was subsequently converted into covalently cross-linked fibrin (FBN) through the action of thrombin (Th), fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF), and calcium ions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the cross-linked blend was more stable than native cross-linked FBN. Tensile behaviors of the PU-FBN materials closely matched those of a natural artery on varying the ratio PU/FBN. Implantation experiments in the rat model showed a mature internal capsule and good tissue organization of PU-FBN (50%) grafts in the regenerated arterial wall. However, 50% of FBN did not assure adequate mechanical resistance, and aneurysmal changes were seen in some grafts. DSC of CLG-based materials, processed by casting, showed that the synthetic component offered definite advantage compared to the CLG denaturation temperature, particularly noticeable for CLG-PAA and CLG-PVAL blends. Material advantages and drawbacks are discussed.","CNR,IST FISIOL CLIN,I-56100 PISA,ITALY; SCUOLA NORMALE SUPER PISA,ENI,I-56100 PISA,ITALY",,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,2,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Many of these complications are caused by the intrinsic thrombogenicity of the biomaterials, which are used to cast the luminal blood sac. Numerous attempts have been made to improve the hemocompatibility of the new generation of totally implantable blood pumps, mainly by physico-chemical modifications of the biopolymeric materials and the blood contacting surfaces. We, on the other hand, believe that the most promising and challenging approach, from both the biologists' and engineers' point of view, is to coat the luminal surfaces of cardiac prostheses with a functional monolayer of autologous endothelial cells (ECs) and thus reproduce ""nature's biocompatible blood container."" The key to lining an artificial heart with a nonthrombogenic monolayer of endothelial cells is to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms which render the EC lining inside the beating ventricle nonthrombogenic and resistant to flow-induced shear stresses and cyclic, tensional deformations. This knowledge has then to be translated into biotechnological know-how, in order to maintain an intact EC monolayer inside the blood sac of an artificial device. In this paper we emphasize some of the bioengineering issues associated with the endothelialization of the luminal sac, and also discuss some aspects related to the blood sac itself.","UNIV WISCONSIN, SCH MED, DEPT MED, CELL BIOL LAB, MILWAUKEE, WI 53201 USA",,,,,,,,93,9,9,0,1,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

Upon heating to about 300-350-degrees-C, 7 spontaneously rearranged to poly(Bisphenol A N-phenylurethane) (4). The rearrangement was a first-order reaction with an activation energy of 180 kJ/mol. The transformation of 7 to 4 was followed by FT-IR. Analysis of the polymer before and after heat treatment by gel permeation chromatography and low-angle laser light scattering indicated that the rearrangement proceeded without detectable backbone cleavage. The chemical structure of 4 was confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR. This polymer formed transparent, amorphous, and mechanically strong films (tensile strength, 567 kg/cm2; tensile modulus, 23,800 kg/cm2; elongation at break, 5.5%). Contrary to unsubstituted polyurethanes, 4 was thermally very stable. The onset of the decomposition exotherm was observed at 475-degrees-C (DSC, in air, open pan), and the polymer started to lose weight at 504-degrees-C (TGA, in air). Since N-substituted polyurethanes cannot be readily obtained by conventional polymerization reactions, the exceptionally clean, thermal rearrangement of 7 to 4 represents a rare case of a synthetically useful, polymeric backbone rearrangement.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,APR 29,1991.0,24.0,9,,,,,2302,2308,,10.1021/ma00009a028,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FJ881,WOS:A1991FJ88100028,,,,,2019-02-25

The integrated Py-FI mass spectra give characteristic fingerprints of the biomaterials investigated. The application of principal component analysis to the mass spectral data results in a clear discrimination and classification of the samples reflecting the chemical modifications and transformations of organic matter by biochemical and biogeochemical processes. The chemical compositions are determined by processes such as enrichment and/or translocation of plant constituents (e.g. carbohydrates, lignin, lipids, suberin, and aliphatic polymers) during maturation and senescence of needles; amendment of new components; decomposition; selective preservation and humification processes in the soil environment. During needle maturation, major chemical changes include the decrease of carbohydrate content, condensation of lignin, and crosslinking of waves. Senescent needles are characterized by lower contents of carbohydrates and lower yields of monomeric pyrolysis products from lignin. The contribution of different litter materials to the humus layer can be estimated by differences in chemical composition. During litter decomposition and humification on the forest floor, carbohydrate content decreases rapidly. The lignin content remains almost constant but some subunits are continuously oxidized. Wax material accumulates until the mechanical disintegration of the needle occurs. In the O-horizons polymeric aliphatic materials are enriched in humified plant remains. A constant increase of aryl-alkyl esters from suberin in the O-horizons is due to both root input and selective preservation.

To test an existing model for its usefulness in quantitative evaluation of periodontal wound healing, large supraalveolar periodontal defects were surgically created around the mandibular premolars (P2, P3, P4) in the left or right jaw quadrants in 5 beagle dogs. The defects were exposed to the oral environment for 6 months and were then subjected to reconstructive flap surgery (chronic defects). Healing in these defects was compared to healing following reconstructive surgery in similar contralateral defects which had not been exposed to plaque and calculus (acute defects). The animals were sacrificed after a 4-week healing period and tissue blocks including teeth and surrounding structures were processed for histometric analysis. Mean defect height (+/- s.d) for chronic and acute defects amounted to 4.6 +/- 0.3 and 4.4 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. Mean connective tissue repair to the root surface in chronic defects amounted to 62% (range 49% to 74%) of the defect height. Mean connective tissue repair in the acute defects exceeded 94% of the defect height in 4 of the dogs, but amounted to only 48% in 1 dog. Regeneration of alveolar bone and cementum was limited under both experimental conditions. Root resorption was frequently encountered, whereas ankylosis was seen in only few teeth. This study indicates that healing may vary not only as a result of controlled experimental variables, but also due to differences in biological response between dogs or to fortuitous traumatic factors. The variability in healing in the chronic defects imposes limitations on the use of this defect model to study periodontal regeneration, especially when a small number of animals is used.","NATL DENTAL HLTH SERV, KRISTIANSTAD, SWEDEN; UNIV BERGEN, N-5014 BERGEN, NORWAY","WIKESJO, UME (reprint author), LOMA LINDA UNIV, SCH DENT, LOMA LINDA, CA 92350 USA.",,"Wikesjo, Ulf/A-4159-2009","Wikesjo, Ulf/0000-0003-1607-0583",,,,38,35,35,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-3492,1943-3670,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

To investigate the growth characteristics of endothelial cells on theoretically suitable biomaterials, we compared three polyurethanes (Pellethane, Biomer, Enka) and three silicone rubbers (Elastosil, 3145 RTV, Medical Adhesive). All synthetic surfaces were precoated with an extracellular matrix (group 1), fibronectin (group 2), or a glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix (group 3). After the seeding of 2.5 X 10(4)/cm2 human endothelial cells onto the various surfaces, primary adherence, growth kinetics, and maintenance of monolayer integrity were studied for 13 days. On the three polyurethanes all precoating procedures resulted in endothelial cell proliferation and the formation of persistent monolayers. In contrast, on silicone rubbers a persistent coverage with a confluent endothelium could be achieved only on the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix. When endothelial cell growth was quantitatively assessed on all precoating substrates, the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix proved to be far superior on each of the synthetics (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of endothelialization of artificial hearts in vitro. Provided such an endothelium can withstand the mechanical forces within an artificial heart, in vitro endothelialization might contribute to a regained attractiveness of the elective long-term implantation of artificial hearts.","UNIV VIENNA,DEPT SURG 2,A-1010 VIENNA,AUSTRIA; UNIV FREIBURG,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,W-7800 FREIBURG,GERMANY; UNIV CAPE TOWN,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,CAPE TOWN,SOUTH AFRICA",,,,,,,,28,11,11,0,1,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-5223,,,J THORAC CARDIOV SUR,J.

The precise conditions when it might occur are not known. Many processing and property variations can affect the stresses developed throughout a porcelain-alloy system. To understand this, a computer simulation of stress in a PFM strip was conducted. The simulation considers cooling from temperatures higher than the porcelain sag point. The following temperature-dependent factors were incorporated : the elastic modulus, shear viscosity (porcelain), and coefficient of thermal expansion. Cooling rates during tempering of porcelain were measured. The cooling rate dependencies of the glass transition temperature and temperature distribution during cooling were also included in the simulation. The results suggest that tempering with a high cooling rate make up for compressive residual stress in body porcelain and the high curvature of the composite beam.",,"ASAOKA, K (reprint author), UNIV TOKUSHIMA,SCH DENT,3-18-15 KURAMOTO CHO,TOKUSHIMA 770,JAPAN.",,,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS SANSHIN HOKUSEI BLDG,TOKYO,"4-9 YOYOGI 2-CHOME SHIBUYA-KU, TOKYO 151, JAPAN",0914-8809,,,JSME INT J I-SOLID M,,APR,1991.0,34.0,2,,,,,156,162,,10.1299/jsmea1988.34.2_156,,,,7,"Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,FP412,WOS:A1991FP41200007,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

According to this criterion, biomaterials such as hemodialysis membranes made from cellulosic or various synthetic polymers were classified as activators or nonactivators of complement. Since certain membranes bind large quantities of C3a from the fluid phase, classification based on fluid-phase C3a concentration has in some instances been inaccurate. As follows from the comparison of complement activation by cuprophane and polyacrylonitrile membranes, the capacity of a biomedical polymer to activate complement is not determined by the number of potential covalent binding sites on its surface. Biomaterial itself may lack hydroxyl and/or amino groups, and yet it may activate C3 in human serum very efficiently. Some of the biomaterials may also bind unactivated/unfragmented C3 whether in the absence or presence of other serum proteins. In addition, binding of factor B (a promotor of C3 activation) and binding of factor H (an inhibitor of C3 activation) to certain biomaterials have been found to be independent of complement activation and unaffected by the presence or absence of C3. Thus, it is becoming apparent that the requirements for the formation and stability of the C3 convertase on artificial surfaces differ from those on biological membranes, and that the relative magnitude of binding of factor B and factor H to the surface per se cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the capacity of the biomaterial to activate complement. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of C3 and C5 activation on the surfaces of biomedical polymers. Its understanding should lead to the development of new or modification of existing artificial membranes which would cause less adverse effects for patients during extracorporeal procedures.",,"JANATOVA, J (reprint author), UNIV UTAH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,50 N MED DR,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84132, USA.",,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [DK 35830]; NIAID NIH HHS [AI 19319],,,0,56,56,0,6,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1012-8204,,,COMPLEMENT INFLAMMAT,,MAR-APR,1991.0,8.0,2,,,,,61,69,,10.1159/000463181,,,,9,Immunology,Immunology,FF582,WOS:A1991FF58200001,2055009.0,,,,2019-02-25

When the DDS-glass was coated with albumin alone, platelets were only contact adherent and could not spread at all. After competitive adsorption of fibrinogen and albumin, however, platelets were able to spread on the surface. Platelet activation increased linearly as the surface fibrinogen concentration increased up to 0.02-mu-g/cm2.

Three monomers, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, and 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate, as well as two common inhibitors, hydroquinone and 4-methoxyphenol, were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity assays as aqueous solutions at different concentrations. A new polymerization initiator, 2,2'-azo-bis-(2,4-dimethyl valeronitrile), was thermally decomposed in water at different concentrations and the products were also assayed for cytotoxicity. Assays were based on incubation with human choroidal fibroblasts. Cell death was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion, DNA synthesis inhibition, and lactate dehydrogenase tests. While methyl methacrylate and 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate were found nontoxic, the other chemicals displayed high cytotoxicity. However, when extracts of synthesized poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) specimens, differentially treated after polymerization, were subjected to the same assays it was found that toxicity from residual 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate monomer was lost during steam sterilization and storage in water because of the removal of the monomer through aqueous washing. The lack of toxicity in these specimens suggests that residual contents of inhibitor and initiator are too low to cause toxic effects on choroidal fibroblasts.

Vein replacements are the most vulnerable to thrombosis because of their low shear rates and low pressure. Experimental replacement of microvenous segments with prosthetic segments has shown little success. Recent technological advances in biomaterials and control of thrombogenesis provide the potential for success in the development of venous prostheses. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of nonbiodegradable composite polyurethane microvascular prostheses for reconstruction of rat femoral veins. Rat femoral venous defects of 10 mm were reconstructed with autogenous vein (n = 12), unprocessed plain polyurethane (n = 5), and nonbiodegradable composite polyurethane (n = 31). Patency was evaluated by direct observation and proximal venous milking tests. The patency rate of composite grafts was not significantly different from that of isotopic vein (p = 0.5, Fisher's exact test), and both had higher patency than unprocessed polyurethane (p < 0.01). Composite grafts were examined sequentially using light and scanning electron microscopy. Grafts were fully endothelialized between the first and third months. The neointimal, neomedial, and neoadventitial layers could be seen more distinctly over time. New opportunities in reconstructive microsurgery may be opened by microvascular prostheses that are compliant and thromboresistant.","DUKE UNIV, MED CTR, DIV PLAST RECONSTRUCT MAXILLOFACIAL & ORAL SURG, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA; DUKE UNIV, MED CTR, DIV PHYSIOL, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA; DUKE UNIV, MED CTR, DEPT PATHOL, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA",,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0032-1052,1529-4242,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

We have made use of recombinant hirudin (rHir) by covalently binding it to both biomolecules and prosthetic biomaterials. Heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents were used to derivatize rHir and form covalent crosslinks between rHir and albumin producing active conjugates. Both derivatized rHir and conjugates inhibited human alpha-thrombin similarly, however, both showed a ten-fold decrease of alpha-thrombin inhibition when compared to rHir alone using the tripeptide substrate, S-2238. Immobilization of 2.75 +/- 0.45-mu-g rHir on 1.0 cm2 Dacron prosthetic graft patches resulted in inhibition of 1.88 +/- 0.03-mu-g alpha-thrombin in solution (mean +/- SD, n = 3), which is a 8:1 molar ratio, respectively. rHir ED50 inhibition of 0.1 NIH U alpha thrombin stimulated whole blood platelet aggregation was 0.12 x 10(-6)-mu-M. The conjugate ED50 inhibition was 1.37 x 10(-6)-mu-M showing an eleven-fold loss of activity. We conclude that there is only a ten-fold loss of inhibitory activity when rHir is covalently immobilized and that this technique has a benefit of localizing antithrombin activity to surfaces or soluble carrier molecules.","HARVARD UNIV,NEW ENGLAND DEACONESS HOSP,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02215",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R0-1 HL21796],,,15,11,11,1,1,RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH",0957-5235,,,BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN,Blood Coagul.

This approach was used to provide substrates that were adhesive to cells even in the absence of serum proteins and with no prior pretreatment of the surface with proteins of the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) family. This approach was used to dramatically enhance the cell-adhesiveness of substrates that were otherwise cell-nonadhesive and to improve control of cellular interactions with cell-adhesive materials by providing stably bound adhesion ligands. Glycophase glass was examined as a model cell-nonadhesive substrate prior to modification, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were examined as representative materials for biomedical applications. The peptides were surface-coupled by their N-terminal amine to surface hydroxyl moieties using tresyl chloride chemistry. Prior to peptide grafting, the PET and PTFE were surface hydroxylated to yield PETOH and PTFE-OH. The PET-OH was less cell-adhesive and the PTFE-OH was much more cell-adhesive than the native polymers. Radioiodination of a C-terminal tyrosine residue was used to quantify the amount of peptide coupled to the surface, and these amounts were 12.1 pmol/cm2 on glycophase glass, 139 fmol/cm2 on PETOH, and 31 fmol/cm2 on PTFE-OH. Although the glycophase glass did not support adhesion or spreading even in the presence of serum, the RGD- and YIGSR-grafted glycophase glass did support adhesion and spreading, even when the only serum protein that was included was albumin. Although PET and PTFE-OH supported adhesion when incubated in serum-supplemented medium, neither of these materials supported adhesion with only albumin present, indicating that cell adhesion is mediated by adsorbed CAM proteins. When these materials were peptide-grafted, however, extensive adhesion and spreading did occur even when only albumin was present. Since the peptide grafting is quite easily controlled and is temporally stable, while protein adsorption is quite difficult to precisely control and is temporally dynamic, peptide grafting may be advantageous over other approaches employed to improve long-term cell adhesion to biomaterials.","UNIV TEXAS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,AUSTIN,TX 78712",,,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",,,,26,234,239,0,44,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Cell adhesion and deposition of chemicals such as calcium, lipoproteins and mucin on the lens surface cause visual acuity which is the main problem in extended uses of contact occular lenses. In order to minimise the cell adhesion and other type of depositions, a method of surface modification of lens involving the use of phosphoryl choline, a phospholipid and the glow discharge technique has been described. The power variation of the lenses after modification has been checked using Topcon lensometer. The possible power changes of the modified samples due to the exposure to the normal light in the laboratory, darkness, ultraviolet (U.V.) light or saline have been investigated by taking the visible and ultra violet spectra using Beckman spectrophotometer. Surface energy variations after modifications of the samples have been checked by sessile drop water contact angle measurements. Glow discharge treatment increases the hydrophilicity of the samples. It seems, the modifications do not affect the power of hard contact lens significantly. It is also observed that the exposure of samples to the normal light in the laboratory, darkness, U.V. light or saline make no significant change in the visible and ultraviolet spectra of the samples before and after modification.","SREE CHITRA TIRUNAL INST MED SCI & TECHNOL,DIV BIOSURFACE TECHNOL,BIOMED TECHNOL WING,TRIVANDRUM 695012,INDIA",,,"Sharma, Chandra/A-4140-2009","Sharma, Chandra/0000-0002-6982-0926",,,,15,5,5,1,5,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",1055-7172,,,BIOMAT ARTIF CELL IM,Biomater.

The preparations were examined by scanning or transmission electron microscopy. The surface of dry collagen fibers cut at room temperature appeared compressed. Observations of the internal substructure were distorted. The open face of the fibers were frequently covered with debris. Conversely, when fibers were frozen and then fractured, dehydrated fibers appeared to have undistorted features and were intact around their edges. No contamination across the face of the fiber was apparent and there was no difference in morphology between the nitrogen and Freon frozen dehydrated collagen fibers. Transmission electron microscopy showed that collagen fibers were composed of a subpopulation of transverse and longitudinal collagen fibrils and fibril bundles embedded in a disorganized amorphous collagen matrix. Freeze fracturing or snapping collagenous biomaterials was shown to be an effective method for retaining the substructure of these dry and very fragile materials.

We have identified proteins expressed on the surfaces of retrieved vascular grafts to determine if certain proteins were present at the end stage of vascular failure. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of protein adsorption on the surfaces of retrieved vascular prostheses was determined using antibodies to human blood proteins fibrinogen, fibronectin, Hageman factor (factor XII and factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor. The detection of these proteins on the blood contacting surface was evaluated by immunogold labelling with protein A-gold beads followed by silver enhancement. Fibronectin was the most abundant protein detected on retrieved expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or umbilical vein grafts. Protein adsorption was disperse for all proteins and one protein, fibronectin, was found in great amounts on all surfaces. Proteins such as fibronectin may be important in the adhesion and activation of platelets and leukocytes and thus contribute to the development of thrombosis. These analyses of human vascular grafts indicate that surface proteins can be readily detected by our methods and thus may be useful in determination of specific proteins important in the thrombogenicity and/or biocompatibility of cardiovascular devices.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL,DEPT PATHOL,2085 ADELBERT RD,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,39,20,20,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,1,,,,,73,82,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK711,WOS:A1991GK71100009,,,,,2019-02-25

The application of these procedures resulted in a versatile, low toxicity GMA embedding medium. GMA embedding medium and resin blocks were tested utilizing a variety of physico-chemical techniques, namely: gas chromatography, determination of the maximum temperature reached during polymerization, the time taken to reach the maximum temperature, hardness testing, determination of the glass transition temperature, and measurement of the dimensional changes following section stretching and mounting at various temperatures. Data obtained from these techniques enabled a multi-purpose GMA embedding medium to be precisely specified. The infiltration solution, as well as the accelerator solution, of this mixture contains fewer toxic components than comparable systems. The infiltration solution consists of GMA monomer and a non-toxic plasticizer (2-isopropoxy ethanol). The initiator is a 50% damped dibenzoyl peroxide, and the accelerator solution is composed of a mixture of polyethylene glycol 200 and a low concentration of a low toxicity tertiary amine (N,N,3,5-tetramethylaniline). Resin blocks obtained from this mixture are highly transparent, do not become coloured, and are easy to cut at 0.5-2.0-mu-m. Various histological techniques, such as routine embedding of implanted biomaterials, histochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry were carried out; the new GMA embedding medium proved to be applicable in all the techniques without laborious modifications.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT PATHOL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS; HERAEUS KULZER GMBH,W-6393 WEHRHEIM,GERMANY; UNIV SHEFFIELD,DEPT BIOMED SCI,SHEFFIELD S10 2TN,S YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND","GERRITS, PO (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT ANAT & EMBRYOL,69 OOSTERSINGEL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,29,11,11,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,189,198,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300001,,,,,2019-02-25

Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus hominis strains were examined for adhesion and proliferation morphology to polyurethane foam and smooth silicone rubber prosthetic biomaterials. Ruthenium red, alcian blue and ruthenium red-lysine in en bloc procedures were applied to optimally visualize the polysaccharide slime. Ruthenium red processing resulted in observation of additional outer material close to the cell wall, more than seen in the absence of cationic reagent. Alcian blue preserved fibrous or net-like strands or meshworks of material. Ruthenium red-lysine preserved considerable amounts of slime covering the cocci as well as extending between them and the prosthetic surface. Elongate strands of slime appeared to facilitate attachment to the substrate and projection of cells away from the substrate. Where this material was lacking, cell mass buildup was required for projection from the substrate. The amount of fibrous material observed corresponded to levels of slime production known for each staphylococci strain. Some extracellular material was observed for even the classified ""non-slime"" S. hominis strain SP2. The ruthenium red-lysine approach was optimal for visualization of slime for all bacterial species in this study.","MED COLL WISCONSIN,DEPT SURG,SURG MICROBIOL RES LAB,MILWAUKEE,WI 53226; MED COLL WISCONSIN,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,MILWAUKEE,WI 53226","FASSEL, TA (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN,MUSCLE BIOL LAB,1805 LINDEN DR,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,,,,,34,7,7,0,2,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,199,208,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300002,,,,,2019-02-25

DSC cross-linked with hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDSC) had already been tested previously. In the present study, we compared tissue interactions of non-cross-linked DSC (NDSC) and glutaraldehyde-cross-linked DSC (GDSC) with those of HDSC. To gain more insight in the relation between basophil-like cells, foreign body multinucleate giant (FBM-G) cells derived from them, and aluminum/silicate (Al/Si)-crystals, we also implanted agarose-embedded Al/Si-crystals. GDSC induced early after implantation extensive lipid formation, cell degeneration and death, but NDSC did not have any cytotoxic effects. Basophil-like (FBM-G) cells specifically dealt with Al/Si-crystals, because they were attracted by the agarose-embedded Al/Si-crystals. These cells were also attracted by GDSC and NDSC, where Al/Si-crystals are present. Accumulation of Al/Si-crystals was especially prominent with GDSC. Degradation by phagocytosis was in part carried out by FBM-G cells, derived from macrophages or fibroblasts, and observed only with GDSC, which indicates that the presence of cross-links is a prerequisite for their formation.","TWENTE UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT CHEM TECHNOL,7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS","VANWACHEM, PB (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,BIOMAT RES SECT,OOSTERSINGEL 692,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,48,19,19,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,251,263,,,,,,13,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300007,,,,,2019-02-25

Matrix vesicle (MV) numbers, diameters, distances to calcifying fronts, and numbers of MV-types were recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and histomorphometry. Implants were surrounded by time-dependent and implant-dependent primary calcification. The bonding type displayed more intratibial bone than the non-bonding type. Bone-bonding implants supported mineralization via increased MV numbers when compared to metal oxide containing non-bonding implants. High MV diameters correlated with a high osteoblastic forming capacity in both implants. The intravesicular crystal formation around bone-bonding implants was slightly delayed. At 6 days , MV distances to calcifying fronts were significantly smaller in non-bonding implants. Non-bonding implants did not affect intravesicular hydroxyapatite (HA) crystal growth significantly, which contradicts in vitro findings. They affected osteoblastic function via a reduced production of MV and extracellular matrix (ECM). Osteoblastic function and the growth of calcifying fronts might be disturbed by leached metal oxides rather than MV function. Techniques and parameters used here may serve as means of batch-testing surface reactives and other biomaterials.","FREE UNIV BERLIN,KLINIKUM STEGLITZ,INST PATHOL,HINDENBURGDAMM 30,W-1000 BERLIN 45,GERMANY; FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST ANAT,W-1000 BERLIN 33,GERMANY; HEBREW UNION COLL,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90007; HEBREW UNION COLL,DEPT PERIODONT,LOS ANGELES,CA 90007; HEBREW UNION COLL,DIV ORAL PATHOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90007; UNIV TEXAS,DEPT ORTHOPAED,SAN ANTONIO,TX 78285",,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,4,,,,,341,352,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,HX409,WOS:A1991HX40900007,,,,,2019-02-25

The surfaces studied included polyethylene (PE), silicone rubber (SR), Teflon-FEP (FEP), and two polyetherurethanes: one with a poly(tetramethylene oxide) soft segment (PTMO-PU) and one with a poly(ethylene oxide) soft segment (PEO-PU). The adsorption of these proteins from single-component solutions followed the Freundlich isotherm and the adhesive proteins showed similar trends in Freundlich parameters for surfaces of similar surface wettability. Adsorption from a quaternary-component solution composed of physiological molar ratios of the three proteins and human serum albumin (HSA) revealed a significant enrichment of adsorbed vitronectin as determined from ratios of the adsorbed surface fraction of each protein to its respective bulk fraction.

The relative enrichment of VN from plasma was also high as compared with its bulk concentration, whereas the enrichment of FGN, FN, and HSA was much lower and of approximately the same magnitude. Compared with the three other proteins, VN showed a resistance to displacement from the polymer substrates as either the plasma concentration was increased or the length of contact with plasma and diluted plasma was increased.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,1415 W JOHNSON DR,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-21001, HL-24046]",,,53,70,70,2,28,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Analysis of displacement has been focused principally on molecular events on the adsorbing surface. In this paper attention is directed rather to the antecedent transport phenomena necessary to deliver successive proteins to a surface. The different limitations on protein arrival fixed by the total quantity present and by the rates of transport of super-sufficient quantities are distinguished. The transport perspective is then used to ask, and partly answer, the question: Can protein displacement be responsible for patterns of thrombus formation and cellular adhesion that are seen on the blood-wetted surfaces of devices found in medical practice: artificial organs and vascular prostheses? Calculations and a small amount of preliminary data suggest that such patterns may form when blood is introduced into these devices, particularly in the neighborhood of boundary shapes that cause separated flows.",,"LEONARD, EF (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV,ARTIFICIAL ORGANS RES LAB,NEW YORK,NY 10027, USA.",,,,,,,15,56,57,0,17,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

All materials induced a close tissue reaction. There was no statistical difference between the tested materials regarding the time-evolution of the inflammatory cells. However, when comparing CP Ti with 316L, a significant difference was found in the fibrocyte kinetics: in the short term, fibrocyte densities were lower for 316L, while beyond 12 weeks, they exhibited higher values than CP Ti.

We here report an in vitro biomechanical evaluation of a biodegradable particulate composite that might be used for similar purposes. The composite includes a matrix phase consisting of a hydrolyzable prepolymer [polypropylene fumarate (PPF)] cross-linked with methacrylate monomer, and a particulate phase consisting of tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. We implanted dynamic hip screws in 22 cadaveric proximal femora and measured the yield load for an oblique force applied to the femoral head. The hip screws were then reinforced with either PMMA or the PPF composite and tested again. On the basis of analysis of variance, the average increases in yield load for PMMA and PPF reinforcement of 1,750 and 1,130 N were statistically significant (p < 0.00005), suggesting that both materials enhance congruence between implant and bone and thereby increase the projected load-bearing area of the implant. The increase in yield force with PMMA was slightly higher than the increase with PPF (p < 0.05), but both values after reinforcement were close (3,790 +/- 561 N for PMMA vs. 3,240 +/- 669 N for PPF). If we can demonstrate that appropriate rates of degradation, bony ingrowth, and static and fatigue properties can be achieved in vivo with this system, our data suggest that this PPF composite may have potential as an adjunct to the internal fixation of unstable fractures of the osteoporotic hip.","BETH ISRAEL HOSP,CHARLES A DANA RES INST,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ORTHOPAED BIOMECH LAB,BOSTON,MA 02215; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115",,,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [CDC CR102550],,,26,24,24,0,2,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Yet commercial polymers are in general unsatisfactory biomaterials. This is due to variability in composition, stability, surface smoothness, and the presence of impurities during production. On the other hand we have already successfully demonstrated that many of the mechanical and physical properties of polymers can be substantially improved by modifications of the surface by simple ion irradiation. Ion irradiation and track etch techniques have been used in a study of the surface properties of polymeric biomaterials, including polyetheylene, and teflon. The experimental results on surface improvement - especially wear, and stability under irradiation are discussed against the theoretical background of ion ranges and energy deposition in the polymer at the atomic/molecular level. Some new and exciting potential commercial applications are briefly referred to. There are implications for all polymeric biomaterials in this most recent practical approach to modification of basic physico-chemical properties.

However, there is continuing debate in the literature regarding their long term stability in biomedical environments, and the validity of using polyurethanes for extended implant applications is still very much in question. While evidence of polymer degradation in explanted devices has been reported by a number of workers, other studies conclude that degradation is minimal. This review discusses possible pathways of biomedical degradation, such as enzymatic and oxidative attack, as well as observed effects such as cracking and calcification. Metal catalyzed degradation may also occur in devices such as pacemaker leads. While a number of model studies have assessed various modes of degradation, reliable accelerated tests for the prediction of the rates of biomedical ageing effects have apparently not been established. The role of additives and surface contaminants in biocompatibility and degradation is also discussed. Finally, as important interactions between a polyurethane polymer and the host body occur at the interface, the surface analysis of polyurethanes is discussed, and it is concluded that proper characterization of the implant surface before and after degradation studies is important for the understanding of degradation, in particular to exclude effects caused not by the polyurethane itself, but by surface contaminants which appear to have been present on the majority of materials subjected to detailed characterization so far.",,"GRIESSER, HJ (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV CHEM & POLYMERS,PRIVATE BAG 10,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA.",,"Griesser, Hans/E-5628-2011","Griesser, Hans/0000-0003-1072-7863",,,,92,62,62,4,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0141-3910,,,POLYM DEGRAD STABIL,Polym.

It is shown that coupling of poly(ethylene glycol) onto the cellulose membrane used for hemodialysis greatly improves the blood compatibility, while graft polymerization of acrylamide onto a silicone membrane used for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation largely reduces clot formation on the surface. The silicone membrane is shown to be effective also for protection of damaged skin, when used with a porous collagen sheet. It is further demonstrated that poly(vinyl alcohol) membranes without and with immobilized collagen can be used for the entrapment of Langerhans islets and for the repair of damaged corneal tissue, respectively.",,"IKADA, Y (reprint author), KYOTO UNIV, BIOMED ENGN RES CTR, 53 KAWAHARA CHO, SAKYO KU, KYOTO 606, JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,19,19,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",0032-3896,1349-0540,,POLYM J,Polym.

Nine 20-30 lb swine underwent posterior spinal fusion at T5-T6, T13-T14, and L2-L3. Autogenous bone, cryopreserved allograft bone, or equal parts of allograft bone and tricalcium phosphate were added to the decorticated posterior elements. A total of 27 sites were prepared for fusion. The spines were retrieved at 6 months and evaluated for integrity and stability of the fusion sites by clinical examination, three-point bending tests, multiplanar radiographs, and undecalcified tetracycline-labeled and decalcified histologic sections. The nine sites that received autogenous bone were solidly fused. There were one clinical and two radiographic nonunions in the nine sites that received cryopreserved allograft bone. Sites that received a mixture of allograft bone and tricalcium phosphate demonstrated slight motion at two locations and radiographic evidence of fusion at all levels. The extent and degree of fusion was not site-specific. Three-point bending analysis did not demonstrate a significant trend as to site or materials specificity. No adverse histologic response was noted. Histologic sections and tetracycline labels confirmed abundant new bone formation at all sites at 6 months. Although autogenous bone remains the gold standard for use in spinal arthrodesis, this study demonstrates the value of cryopreserved allograft bone alone and in combination with tricalcium phosphate in promoting spinal fusion.","UNIV ALABAMA,DIV ORTHOPAED SURG,619 S 19TH ST,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35233",,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,0,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,,1991.0,16.0,8,,S,,,S330,S333,,,,,,4,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,GB441,WOS:A1991GB44100005,1785082.0,,,,2019-02-25

Two recent applications of modern SIMS are presented: element distributions in recovering tissue at implanted titanium-base screws in rabbit tibia bone and high-resolution topography and elemental imaging of human dental enamel and dentine. By step-scan and quantitative profiling, the composition of the interface layer between the screw and the bone tissue was studied, and upper concentration limits of element leakage were determined. By high-resolution SIMS imaging new microstructures were detected in the recovery layer. The element distributions and morphologies of the dental tissues are presented in micrographs at very high lateral resolution (ca. 20 nm). For the first time SIMS imaging of individual apatite crystallites and their arrays is demonstrated.","GOTHENBURG UNIV,SCH DENT,S-40033 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN; UNIV CHICAGO,ENRICO FERMI INST,CHICAGO,IL 60637; UNIV GOTHENBURG,DEPT HANDICAP RES,S-41312 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN","LODDING, AR (reprint author), CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT PHYS,S-41296 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,26,27,28,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0003-2670,,,ANAL CHIM ACTA,Anal.

This, in turn, can be obtained from the wave-vector- and frequency-dependent dielectric response function of the system, epsion(q,w), via the energy-loss function, lm[-1/epsilon(q,w)]. We describe two different possible approaches to obtaining these functions, one based on the semiempirical tight-binding approximation, the other using Hedin's many-body treatment of quasiparticle states in solids. These methods are exemplified with calculations for cubi ice (as a model for cellular ""structured"" water) and trans-polyacetylene. The availability of supercomputers makes the application of these techniques feasible.","UNIV TEXAS, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA","ZAIDER, M (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV, COLL PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS, CTR RADIOL RES, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,35,2,2,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1078-3482,,,INT J SUPERCOMPUT AP,Int.

In contrast, most of the existing joint prostheses operate not under fluid film but under mixed lubrication, which induces some tribological problems such as loosening and wear.

Since the dental implant must extend from the mandibular or maxillary jaw, through the oral mucosa, and into the oral cavity, these tissue responses include epithelium, connective tissue and bone. The continual occlusal forces acting upon these tissues reinforce the dynamic character of these tissue responses. Immediately upon implantation, a healing phase begins as a response to the implanted biomaterial. Following this immediate response a longer healing phase occurs, beginning approximately 1 week after implantation, resulting in the modeling of bone to the implant as well as the formation of epithelial attachment to the implant. This later, delayed healing continues throughout the lifetime of the implant since these tissues must die and be replaced by similar tissues. Current dental research employing scanning electron microscopy is now documenting these tissue responses. This paper reviews, in detail, SEM observations of these tissue responses.","MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL SURG,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT PROSTHODONT,AUGUSTA,GA 30912; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT RESTORAT DENT,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294","STEFLIK, DE (reprint author), MED COLL GEORGIA,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL PATHOL,AUGUSTA,GA 30912, USA.",,,,,,,64,10,10,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",0891-7035,,,SCANNING MICROSCOPY,Scanning Microsc.,DEC,1990.0,4.0,4,,,,,1021,1038,,,,,,18,Microscopy,Microscopy,EY836,WOS:A1990EY83600015,2094003.0,,,,2019-02-25

One of the most important functions is the screening for toxic effects of the biomaterials. The spectrum of changes elicited ranges from cell death to alterations of cell adhesion, proliferation and biosynthetic activity. Such test systems may involve the direct contact of cells with the biomaterials or the use of soluble extracts of the latter. The rapid, cost-effective and highly sensitive in vitro methods have to be weighed against the problem of validity of extrapolation to the in vivo situation. The first step in testing potential biomaterials may be termed ""general"" biocompatibility testing and usually involves the use of various cell lines (i.e. transformed cells) which can be easily cultivated and passaged in the laboratory for long periods. Although the latter is convenient and highly sensitive for recognizing and excluding toxic materials at an early stage in the process of toxicity testing, this method cannot be regarded as exhaustive. It is proposed that such screening methods be followed by a second in vitro phase, in which primary and early passage cells of a type relevant to the proposed application of the medical device are used. This ""specific"" biocompatibility testing is an attempt to simulate the in vivo situation as closely as possible. A further component of such a testing scheme involves the use of relevant biological parameters, such as cell adhesion or the production of specific biosynthetic products by the relevant cell type. It is thus possible to construct a spectrum of in vitro changes, ranging from marked inhibition of growth with frank cell death (""not biocompatible"") to marked stimulation of relevant growth and other cell biological parameters (""biocompatible and bioactive""). An expansion of in vitro testing methods can offer a method to ""tailor"" biomaterials for specific in vivo applications. In conclusion, it must be stressed that all in vitro experimentation, whether ""general"" of ""specific"", cannot replace the subsequent in vivo testing. Both components are necessary in an adequate scheme for testing potential biomaterials.",,"KIRKPATRICK, CJ (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,INST PATHOL,W-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,101,101,0,7,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Two new techniques, not previously used in biomaterials research involving the study of locomotor morphology of neutrophils and cell movement through agarose gels, were used in this study. Chromium ion concentrations from 0.05 to 10 p.p.m. and cobalt ion concentrations from 0.5 to 30 p.p.m. were not chemotactic for neutrophils under agarose and did not induce neutrophils to polarize. As neutrophils must take up a locomotor morphology before migrating, it is clear that cobalt and chromium ions in a protein-free environment are not chemotactic for human neutrophils. Concentrations of > 2.5 p.p.m. nickel ions did induce neutrophils to polarize, probably a result of the nickel ions causing depolarization of the neutrophil plasma membrane.",,"REMES, A (reprint author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,INST MED & DENT BIOENGN,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,0,16,16,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The dynamic sorption process of radiolabelled proteins on the surfaces was followed by detecting the radioactivity at the exit stream of the column, which was the response of a pulse stimulus at the inlet. The mathematical model was described and solved using 'parameter estimation by cybernetic moment technique', and the adsorption rate constants of plasma proteins on different biomaterial surfaces were calculated. By evaluation of the response curves with standard and cybernetic moment techniques, the following results were obtained. Albumin and fibrinogen adsorption is competitive, and the competition is strongly dependent upon the surface characteristics of the biomaterial. Preadsorption or preferential adsorption of albumin decreases the fibrinogen adsorption, and therefore increases the biocompatibility of material surface. Adsorption of blood plasma proteins are irreversible.

The strategy for achieving of biological activity of polymers, the designs of them, polymers syntheses, and biological and biomedical examinations are discussed. As polymeric anticancer drugs polymeric prodrugs having 5-fluorouracil moieties were prepared and their in vivo activity was investigated using Ehrlich's Sarcoma 180 ascites tumor-bearing mice. It was found that polysaccharide-coated-liposome encapsuled nucleic acid analogs show potent immunomodulating activities. This was done by monitoring the in vitro superoxide anion production from activated human neutrophils and in vivo from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, heparin and/or prostaglandin I2-immobilized hydrogel was entrapped in poly(vinyl chloride). From the result of the activated partial thromboplastin time, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and hole blood clotting time using human blood it was seen that the drug-immobilized antithrombogenic biomaterials provide high antithrombogenicity.","OSAKA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL FINE CHEM,SUITA,OSAKA 565,JAPAN","AKASHI, M (reprint author), KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL CHEM,1-21-40 KORIMOTO,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN.",,,,,,,90,16,17,1,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,Adv.

In a study of the cytotoxicity of four biomaterials and drugs, these two criteria were determined by different techniques. There were notable similarities and differences among the different methods used. Cell viability, which was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test, spectrophotometric microtitration (neutral red) and flow cytometry (fluorescein diacetate) gave similar results.

Knowledge of interactions with biomaterials and the resultant pathophysiological reactions is still very limited. The safety of the heart-lung machine lies, to a great extent, in the hands of the operator; precautions against breakdowns and accidents are necessary. The effects of the extracorporeal circulation process manifest themselves clinically as organ malfunctions. The risk is clearly associated with the age of the patient and the duration of the procedure. The fact that the extracorporeal circulation-and with it the heart operation - affects not just a single organ, but rather the entire organism, requires detailed knowledge of the general state of health of the patient to be operated upon. Only on this basis can the necessary individual operational strategies be developed.","BENEDIKT KREUTZ REHABIL ZENTRUM HERZ & KREISLAUFKRANKE,BAD KROZINGEN,GERMANY",,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,0,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,BERLIN 33,"C/O SPRINGER-VERLAG, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, 1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY",0300-5860,,,Z KARDIOL,Z.

The method is based on depositing a pulse of heat into the material of choice, and fitting the subsequent local temperature decay to that predicted by a theoretical model. This transient method is most suitable in situations where frequent measurements of the thermal conductivity are desired. The method was evaluated by calculating the thermal conductivity of several inert materials. The measured conductivities compared well with published values. The developed technique was also used to examine the applicability of the ""apparent conductivity"" index to combine both conductive and blood-convective thermal effects in living, blood perfused tissues. Using both simulated and experimental results, it was shown that the changes in the apparent conductivity are highly correlated with changes in blood flow. However, quantitative application of this index must be restricted to conditions that are similar to those which existed at the time the apparent conductivity was measured.","TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,DEPT VET BIOSCI,IL-32000 HAIFA,ISRAEL; TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,DEPT AGR ENGN,IL-32000 HAIFA,ISRAEL; UNIV ILLINOIS,FAC BIOENGN,DEPT VET BIOSCI,URBANA,IL 61801; UNIV ILLINOIS,FAC BIOENGN,DEPT MECH & IND ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801",,,,,NCI NIH HHS [T32-CA09067]; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL27011],,,17,7,8,0,6,ASME-AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENG,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017",0148-0731,,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.
