For this purpose, cellulose was chemically modified by phosphorylation. Once implanted, phosphorylated cellulose could promote the formation of calcium phosphates, thus having closer resemblance to bone functionality. In a previous investigation, the obtention and the preliminary characterization of cellulose phosphate gels were reported. In the present study, the synthesis by the H3PO4/P2O5/Et3PO4/hexanol method was optimized in terms of reaction parameters. The structure of materials was investigated by FTIR, Raman, and solid-state P-31- and C-13-NMR spectroscopic studies, and X-ray diffraction. Water swelling and stability to sterilization by gamma-radiation were also assessed. It was demonstrated that the present method allows highly phosphorylated cellulose derivatives to be obtained. Cellulose triphosphates gels are described here for the first time. Products obtained were poorly crystallized monoesters, apparently not significantly affected by gamma sterilization and showed a high water swelling capability. Chemical bonding was confirmed by FTIR, Raman, and both P-31- and C-13-NMR spectroscopies. It was also shown that the H3PO4/P2O5/Et3PO4/hexanol method provides a versatile and interesting alternative route to some of the more widely used techniques for the phosphorylation of cellulose.

It was envisaged to take advantage not only of its good matching with mechanical properties of bone but also of its hydroexpansivity, therefore allowing a satisfactory fixation to hard tissue. Both the osteoconduction and the lack of osteoinduction of this material were demonstrated. Grafting of phosphate groups was then envisaged as the means to render cellulose more suitable for orthopedic applications by enhancing its bioactivity. In the present work, the previously optimized phosphorylation reaction was successfully adapted to the surface modification of regenerated cellulose. Modified materials were characterized by XPS, FTIR, and P-31 MAS NMR spectroscopic studies, and contact angle measurements, revealing the chemical bond between phosphate groups and cellulose, as well as the hydrophilic nature of phosphorylated materials, which increases with increasing phosphate contents. Water swelling and resistance to gamma sterilization were assessed as well, showing that phosphorylated materials swell considerably in water and were not affected when sterilization was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The increase in surface roughness attributed to chemical modification was demonstrated through laser rugosimetry measurements.

The relative contribution of each phenomenon is unknown. Hollow fiber microdialysis probes were employed to assess the effect of subcutaneous implantation on glucose flux through polymeric membranes in rats over 8 days and to differentiate the transport effects of biofouling versus tissue changes. Three commercially available membranes were examined: poly(ether sulfone) (PES), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polycarbonate (PC). As measured by glucose recovery (the ratio of microdialysis glucose to blood glucose concentrations), transport through PES membranes was significantly less on day 2 than day 0 (39% decrease, p < 0.05) whereas PAN and PC showed no significant decreases in flux until day 8 (42 and 43%, respectively). Application of a transport model to glucose recovery data obtained before implantation in vivo and after explantation indicated that mass transport resistances originating from biofouling and tissue compartments increased between days 0 and 8. However, on average the biofouling layer adherent to the probe created substantially less resistance to glucose transport (12-24% of total) than did the tissue that surrounded the probe. These results suggested that future material developments for biosensors should be directed at understanding and modifying transport properties of tissues at the implant site.

Short (hour) and long-term (day) exposures were performed. Product ratios were used to determine surface hydrolysis of the polymeric materials. Enzyme kinetics were studied for the monomers when challenged by ACHE, CHE, and PRLE. In the case of PRLE, the V-max for the dimethacrylate substrates varied slightly, but amounted to as much as 10% of that of p-nitrophenylacetate. The K-m for triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was 197 muM for ACHE and 1107 muM for CHE. The V-max was 2.7 nmol/min for ACHE and 3.5 nmol/min for CHE. TEGDMA was converted by CHE at 2% the rate of cholesteryl oleate. Long-term incubations of monomers with CHE and ACHE produced degrees of hydrolysis that evidenced structure dependency in the ability of the enzymes to effect hydrolysis. Particularly resistant were aromativ derivatives and those with branching in methacrylate linkages. Overall, the study confirms the ability of physiologically important esterases to catalyze the hydrolysis of biomaterial methacrylates.

PBLC-OHs were used as the precursor for the synthesis of double bond-functionalized polylactide/epsilon -caprolactones (PBLC-Mas) by reacting the hydroxyl end groups of PBLC-OH with maleic anhydride in melt at 130 degreesC. Acrylic acid/lactide/epsilon -caprolactone g-raft copolymers (PBLCAs) were then successfully carried out by the radical copolymerization of acrylic acid and PBLC-Ma initiated by azobisisobutyronitrile. Finally, nitroxyl radicals [4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy (TAM)] were incorporated into the carboxylic acid sites of the acrylic acid/lactide/epsilon -caprolactone copolymer (TAM-PBLCA) by reacting TAM with PBLCA in the presence of NX-carbonyl diimidazole.

An in vitro biomechanical and radiographic study to evaluate the properties of a newly developed bioactive bone cement for stabilization of the fractured spine, suitable for minimally invasive application. Objectives. To determine the mechanical stability of the fractured spine after injection of the newly developed bioactive bone cement under quasi-static and cyclic loading regimens. Summary of Background Data. Bone cement injection has been reported as a potentially useful, minimally invasive technique for treating vertebral body fracture or stabilizing osteoporosis. However, potential problems associated with the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have prompted the search for alternative solutions, The use of bioactive bone cement as a potential replacement for PMMA has been reported. Methods. Biomechanical and radiographic analyses were used to test the mechanical stability of the fractured spine. The cement used was formed from hydroxyapatite powder containing strontium and bisphenol A diglycidylether dimethacrylate (D-GMA) resin. Twenty-six fresh porcine spine specimens (T10-L1) were divided into three groups: pilot, intact, and cemented. Spinal stiffness and failure strength were recorded in the intact group with the specimens flexed at 10degrees, Uniform injuries were created in all specimens of the cemented group, and compressive loading was applied with 10degrees of flexion until a fracture occurred. The bone cement was injected into the fractured spine, and stiffness was evaluated after 1 hour, Failure strength was also recorded after 3000 and 20,000 fatigue load cycles. Morphology of the specimens was observed and evaluated. Results. Results from a cell biocompatibility test indicated that the new bioactive bone cement was favorable for cell growth. Spinal stiffness significantly decreased after fracture (47.5% of intact condition). Instant stiffness of the spine recovered to 107.8% of the intact condition after bone cement injection. After 3000 and 20,000 cycles of fatigue loading, stiffness of the cemented spine was found to be 93.5% and 94.4% of intact stiffness, respectively (P< 0,05). Average failure strength of the spine was 5056 N (after 3000 cycles' and 5301 N (after 20,000 cycles) after bone cement injection and fatigue loading, Radiographs and cross-sectional observations indicated a good cement-bone bonding and fracture fill. Conclusions. A new bioactive bone cement without cytotoxic effect has been developed. Results show that minimally invasive techniques to apply this cement to porcine spines results in augmentation of mild burst fractures such that the original stiffness and strength of the vertebra are recovered. This new cement therefore shows potential as an augmentation to traditional instrumentation in the surgical management of vertebral fractures. The potential for further clinical applications is currently under investigation.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; First Mil Med Univ, Med Biomech Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Lu, WW (reprint author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"Cheung, Kenneth/0000-0001-8304-0419",,,,33,43,65,0,11,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,DEC 15,2001.0,26,24,,,,,2684,2690,,10.1097/00007632-200112150-00010,,,,7,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,508HG,WOS:000173082200009,11740355.0,,,,2019-02-25

Monocyte adhesion may lead to macrophage activation and the foreign body response. We report that surface chemistry, preadsorbed proteins, and adhesion time all play important roles during monocyte adhesion bi vitro. The surface chemistry of tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), polystyrene, Primaria, and ultra low attachment (ULA) used for adhesion studies was characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Fibrinogen adsorption measured by I-125-labeled fibrinogen was the lowest on ULA, higher on TCPS, and the highest on polystyrene or Primaria. Monocyte adhesion on protein preadsorbed surfaces for 2 h or 1 day was measured with a lactate-dehydrogenase method. Monocyte adhesion decreased over time. The ability of preadsorbed proteins to modulate monocyte adhesion was surface dependent. Adhesion was the lowest on ULA, higher and similar on TCPS or polystyrene, and the highest on Primaria. Monocyte adhesion on plasma or fibrinogen adsorbed surfaces correlated positively and linearly to the amount of adsorbed fibrinogen. Preadsorbed fibronectin, immunoglobulin G, plasma, or serum also promoted adhesion compared with albumin preadsorbed or uncoated surfaces. Overall, biomaterial surface chemistry, the type and amount of adsorbed proteins, and adhesion time all affected monocyte adhesion in vitro.

Widely used commodity polymers were the first polymers to be utilised in biomedical applications. These polymers were not developed with biocompatibility established at the onset and many speciality polymers have been developed in recent years to begin to meet the multifaceted demands for medical development, the optimisation of structure-property correlations and ultimately, clinical use. In the broader area of materials research, combinatorial or high throughput strategies used for drug development are recognised to have potential for discovery and process development. Much of the application of combinatorial chemistry in drugs research has been dependent on the use of polymeric reagents, substrates and supports. The chemistry of the reactions on polymers in solid and liquid phases have also played a major role in combinatorial drugs research. There is considerable interest in combinatorial materials research and this review outlines how this research may be applied for biomedical polymer development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The increase in carboxyl groups was from 26 +/- 14 (12 h of hydrolysis) to 134 12 (144 h of hydrolysis). Although collagen triple helix structure of polyanionic materials was preserved in all cases, a decrease in thermal stability and a gradual loss in the ability of collagen molecules to form fibrils were detected with increasing carboxyl content, probably as a result of changes in the pattern of electrostatic interaction, The resulting materials were basically acellular polyanionic collagen matrixes associated with an elastin content dependent on the time of hydrolysis. The results showed that the procedure described in this work may be a useful process for preparation of collagen biomaterials with variable physicochemical properties and macromolecular arrangement with respect to fibril formation and with potential use in tissue engineering.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim & Fis Mol, BR-13560970 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Goissis, G (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim & Fis Mol, Av Trabalhador Saocarlense 400,CP 780, BR-13560970 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,,,,,,29,35,37,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,WIN,2001.0,2,4,,,,,1074,1079,,10.1021/bm0001188,,,,6,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,528RH,WOS:000174256400003,11777376.0,,,,2019-02-25

Meningeal cultures in serum containing media were analyzed for attachment, spread cell area, proliferation, the production of extracellular matrix (ECM), and neuronal outgrowth. In general, both cell attachment as well as cell spread area decreased with increasing substrate hydrophobicity, whereas cell division as indicated by BrdU incorporation and time to confluence, was lower on the most hydrophobic materials. We suggest that such differences immediately after cell seeding were most likely mediated by differences in surface adsorption of proteins. In longer-term experiments, most of the materials were colonized by meningeal cultures irrespective of surface chemistry, and all cultures were equally inhibitory to neuronal outgrowth suggesting that over time, cells can modify the substrate perhaps by secretion of extracellular matrix molecule proteins. Our data suggests that cell type-specific differences in response to different biomaterials may play an important role in determining the Ultimate nature and composition of the CNS at the host-biomaterial interface.

However, obtaining uniform bioactive collagen films in the nanoscale range and precisely controlling the physical and chemical properties of these biological films is still a challenge for biomedical engineering. Layer-by-layer assembly, i.e., sequential adsorption of oppositely charged macromolecular species, is a powerful new film preparation technique that can be applied to the design of versatile biomaterials, with well-controlled interfacial, mechanical and biological functions. To demonstrate the feasibility of biomaterial design by means of layer-by-layer assembly, type-I collagen thin films were prepared by using this technique with poly(styrene) sulfonate as a partner polyelectrolyte. The gradual build-up of the collagen films was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy and ellipsometry, while their surface morphology was assessed by atomic force microscopy. The thickness of the collagen layers can be changed by increasing the number of bilayers adsorbed with an increment of 13 nm. It was found that the layer-by-layer assembled collagen scaffolds can support the attachment and growth of C2C12 myoblast cells and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Accurate thickness control and compatibility with nerve cell precursors indicate the utility of layer-by-layer assembled films in neuroprosthesis.","[Grant, Gregory G.

The results indicated the hydrophobic character of osteoblastic cells with a contact angle of 26.89 degrees (0.29 degrees). This value could explain the ability of osteoblasts to specifically attach onto hydrophobic surfaces like titanium or hydroxyapatite. The first cellular step of bone healing requires the presence of osteoblasts and their adhesion to biomaterial surfaces is the crucial phase of the osteointegration process. The presence of a monolayer of a newly discovered hydrophobic bacterial exopolysaccharide on coverglass slides appeared to strongly encourage adhesion of osteoblastic cells. In that, providing surfaces with this hydrophobic material induced a selective adsorption of osteoblast cells and might enhance osteo integration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterise the modifications. Such treatments could reduce device-related infection on medical devices. While changes in hydrophilicty, as noted by changes in the contact angle, were seen for the various gas plasma (CO2, H2O and NH3), these had little effect upon bacterial adhesion or antibiotic retention. An improvement was noted for antibiotic retention (ciprofloxacin) on the H2O-plasma treated polyurethane, attributable to the presence of -OH groups, however, this was small. These results suggest that other approaches for reducing device-related infection be examined, such as the direct attachment of a drug-delivery system. To accomplish this for the drug-delivery system of choice, which utilises diisocynate chemistry, the introduction of primary amine groups onto the surface is required. Radiofrequency (RF) and remote microwave (MW) systems were used to introduce these groups onto both the biomedical polymer directly, and an intermediate, ethylene-based, plasma deposited film. The use of such a film would allow this technology to be applied to a variety of different substrates as well as provide a solvent barrier and a means of surface stabilisation. The MW system was found to be superior over the RF system in terms of deposition rate of the polymeric film, the effectiveness of its barrier properties and for the introduction of a higher proportion of primary amine functionality onto the surfaces as determined by XPS. Finally, use of a model system, in conjunction with XPS, confirmed the ability of these modified surfaces to be fut-ther derivatised using the isocyanate chemistry associated with the drug-delivery system. The results indicate that electron spectroscopy and surface modification techniques play an important and critical role towards the development of antimicrobial coatings for medical devices.

In vitro cell activation of human neutrophils (Mac-1 upregulation) has been taken as one measure to assess the attributable risk of inflammation due to biopolymers before their clinical application. Mac-1 expression has generally been measured by flow cytometric assays, whereas quantification of neutrophil adhesion to the biopolymer surfaces has been performed by separate and time-consuming assays, e.g. microscopically by differential cell counting. However, due to an increasing number of surface-modified novel biopolymers entering clinical usage, effective testing of their inflammatory potential is now mandatory. To facilitate these analyses, we have developed a novel flow cytometric assay pennitting simultaneous measurement of biopolymer-mediated neutrophil activation and adhesion. The biopolymers were used as beads (diameter 25 +/- 10 mum), and were demonstrated to be non-phagocytosable and non-fluorescent before being co-incubated with whole human blood (range of ratio granulocytes/beads from 5:1 to 1:1). Besides flow cytometric measurement of Mac-1 up-regulated neutrophils as fluorescing events, a fluorescence of the bead population indicates the adherence of activated neutrophils to the biopolymer surface. After establishing this assay, we evaluated it by comparing six different biopolymers. We observed high levels of Mac-1 expression (> 70% of positive control) accompanied by increased adhesiveness (> 60% of neutrophils) for polyurethane (PUR), polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA), and poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) beads. Low Mac-1 expression levels (< 10%) accompanied by a low percentage of adhering neutrophils ( < 10%) were observed for polyethylene (PE), polyisoprene (PI), and silicone (SI) beads.

This result suggested that each trabecula fracture contributed to a single load peak, which then combined to provide the interlaminar strength. The increment of interlaminar strength due to the trabeculae in the chitin fiber laminae was approximately 30 times in a local region and 3 times in a whole region larger compared to that of the chitin fiber laminae without trabeculae. The chitin fibers were found to be connected between the chitin fiber laminae with the trabeculae being curved and continuous, whilst the trabeculae bonded chitin fiber laminae were distributed in two dimensions within the chitin fiber lamina plane.

The polymers were based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAM). Ethyl methacrylate (EMA) and N-acryloxysuccinimide (NASI) were incorporated into the NiPAM polymer to reduce the lower critical solution temperature and to conjugate to proteins, respectively. To test capacity, of polymers to retain rhBMP-2, rhBMP-2 were labeled with (125)I, formulated with the polymers and were either implanted with a collagen sponge or injected directly into an intramuscular site in rats, The results indicated that implantation with a relatively low polymer concentration (3.9 mg/mL) did not result in significant rhBMP-2 retention, but increasing the polymer concentration (28.7 mg/mL gave a better retention with NiPAM/NASI polymers. In the injectable mode, NiPAM/NASI and NiPAM/EMA gave similar to200-fold better retention after 9 days in vivo. We conclude that synthetic, temperature-sensitive polymers can be engineered to sequester and retain osteoinductive proteins at a Site Of administration.

Rosiak and soon, after formal tests, arrived in the local market (1992). It was a technological breakthrough due to its product characteristics as pain reliever and enhanced healing properties besides its clever production process combining sterilization and crosslinking in a simultaneous operation. IAEA invited professor Rosiak to support the transference of his technology for many laboratories around the world. The laboratories of developing countries, which face all kinds of restrictions, were seduced by the simplicity of the process and low cost of its raw materials. This was the seed of the flourishing activities in hydrogel dressings in Brazil and other developing countries. The technology transfer of the radiation production of hydrogel dressings and other hydrogels to the Brazilian industry is under way. The usual issues associated with radiation processing arise from this experience, i.e. capital costs, misinformation about radiation and lack of expertise on radiation processing. Some other issues concerning local market and social peculiarities also add to the problem. Notwithstanding, many different opportunities arise from those challenges. These technical and commercial issues are roughly: (i) There are plenty of new hydrogels in the market and all say the same. What else radiation processed hydrogels can say? (ii) Regarding to hydrogels and its industrial production as market product, what are the unique characteristics of radiation processing? It was shown that the radiation is a powerful tool for producing hydrogels the same basic formula with improved flexibility, control and purity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The search for improved membrane composition has considered almost every available polymeric material because of its great practical importance. Grafting of polymers with a mixture of monomers is important since different types of chains containing different functional groups are included. A great deal is focused on the waste treatment of heavy and toxic metals from wastewater because of the severe problems of environmental pollution. Functionalized polymers suitable for metal adsorption with their reactive functional groups such as carboxylic and pyridine groups suitable for waste treatment were prepared by radiation grafting method.

PLLA with a molecular weight of 270,000 (PLAO3) was used as thin film. Cell proliferation and differentiation in these biomaterials were compared with tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as a control. Alamar blue and alcian blue staining were carried out to determine the chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, respectively. Samples exposed to these biomaterials promoted cell proliferation in the range of 86-105% of the control proliferation, and a slight but significant increase in cell proliferation was noted only in the culture exposed to PLGA. The sample exposed to PGA elicited a significant 3.7-fold higher (p < 0.01) cell differentiation than controls and was significantly higher than that of the samples exposed to PLLA, PLAO3, and PLGA. After 4 weeks of culture, the cell differentiation from most to least was in the following order PGA > PLAO3 > PLGA = PLLA > Cont. = DMSO. Chondrocyte differentiation of the samples exposed to various biomaterials were significantly higher compared with controls.

Because polymer behavior can vary with the molecular weight, in this study we directly measured the forces between streptavidin and end-grafted monolayers of PEG of different molecular weights and at grafting densities. The results of these measurements show that grafted PEG chains can exist in two different states: a protein-repulsive state and a protein-attractive state. The attractive state can be induced not only by compression but also by increasing the temperature or by altering the polymer molecular weight. Both the critical applied load to induce the protein-attractive form of PEG and the relaxation time back to the protein-resistant state depend on the molecular weight of the grafted chains. The consequences of the observed behavior for the use of grafted PEG chains as protein antifouling coatings of biomaterials are discussed.","Univ Illinois, Dept Chem Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Leckband, DE (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem Engn, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,77,122,123,0,53,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,NOV 27,2001.0,17,24,,,,,7628,7636,,10.1021/la010405c,,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,494VH,WOS:000172306200029,,,,,2019-02-25

This alignment is the same as that observed between Collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals in bone.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Stupp, SI (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2225 N Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Hartgerink, Jeffrey/G-4275-2016; Stupp, Samuel/B-6737-2009","Hartgerink, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3186-5395; ",,,,42,2494,2557,93,1447,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,NOV 23,2001.0,294,5547,,,,,1684,1688,,10.1126/science.1063187,,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,494VW,WOS:000172307400034,11721046.0,,,,2019-02-25

The adhesion of films to the substrates has been studied by scratch tests. Moreover, after exposing the coatings to a simulating body fluid solution. their bioactivity has been monitored by X-ray diffraction analysis of the hydroxylapatite growth. This procedure has been followed for different time scales up to a maximum of 24 days.

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel infection resistant polyurethane biomaterial using textile dyeing technology. This procedure results in incorporation of the antibiotic into the polymer, resulting in a slow, sustained release of antibiotic from the material over time, without the use of exogenous binder agents. Polycarbonate based urethanes were synthesized that contained either a non-ionic (bdPU) or anionic (cPU) chain extender within the polymer backbone and cast into films. The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) was applied to bdPU and cPU using textile dyeing technology, with Cipro uptake determined by absorbance reduction of the ""dyebath."" These dyed bdPU/cPU samples were then evaluated for prolonged Cipro release and antimicrobial activity by means of spectrophotometric and zone of inhibition assays, respectively. Cipro release and antimicrobial activity by dyed cPU segments that were aggressively washed persisted over 9 days, compared with dyed bdPU and dipped cPU control segments that lasted < 24 hours. Dyed cPU segments, which remained in a static wash solution, maintained antimicrobial activity for 11 days (length of study), whereas controls again lost antimicrobial activity within 24 hours. Thus, application of Cipro to the cPU polymer by means of dyeing technology results in a slow sustained release of antibiotic with persistent bacteriocidal properties over extended periods of time.","Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Text, Kingston, RI USA; Cardiotech Int Inc, Woburn, MA USA","Phaneuf, MD (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, 4 Blackfan Circle,Room 131, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R41 HL62764],,,39,11,13,0,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1058-2916,1538-943X,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,NOV-DEC,2001.0,47,6,,,,,634,640,,10.1097/00002480-200111000-00013,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,493TZ,WOS:000172240700012,11730202.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Random copolymers of trimethylene carbonate and epsilon caprolactone (P(epsilon CL-TMC), 50:50) have been synthesized by ring opening polymerization using rare earth alkoxides as initiator. Their potential use as nerve guide repairs has been assessed through indirect and direct in vitro biocompatibility tests and in vivo soft tissue response to EDI subclass macrophages. In vitro, we exposed monolayers of human skin fibroblasts and an established continuous cell line (Hela) to liquid extracts (either pure or diluted in the culture medium) of epsilon CL-TMC copolymer including positive (phenol) and negative controls. Then, colorimetric assays (Neutral red and MTT) were performed. The extracts of epsilon CL-TMC induced no significant cytotoxic effect. We also exposed in vitro Schwann cells to pieces of P(epsilon CL-TMC) and P(LA-GA) copolymers. We evaluated cell attachment at 1 and 3 h by measuring the activity of the lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-beta -hexosaminidase) and cell proliferation at 1, 3, 6 and 9 days by measuring the cell metabolic activity (MTT assay). Values for attachment slightly decreased between 1 and 3 h but were significantly higher than on agars (negative control). Cells plated on epsilon CL-TMC showed a rate of proliferation comparable with that of normalized controls and higher than on PGA-PLA at day 9. Finally, we evaluated in vivo the soft tissue response after implantation of cylindrical tubes of P(epsilon CL-TMC) and P(LA-GA) copolymers with an immunohistochemistry staining procedure for the newly recruited ED1 macrophages. An image analysis system automatically measured the optical density of labelled positive ED1 cells at 9, 21 and 60 days after implantation. epsilon CL-TMC copolymer showed a mild soft tissue reaction with no adverse chronic inflammatory reaction. These data allowed us to consider this conduit as a potential effective substitute in nerve repair. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Studies on Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts have recently provided evidence that cell spreading is mediated by integrins and RhoA. Our previous studies showed that on Cuprophan, a cellulose membrane (CU) to which vitronectin adhesive protein is poorly adsorbed, Swiss 3T3 cells are rounded and undergo cAMP-dependent aggregation. In contrast, on a polyacrylonitrile membrane (AN69) that favours the adsorption of vitronectin and fibronectin, cells spread out and contain low concentrations of cAMP. We have now examined the parts played by the three components in the cAMP pathway (receptors, G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase itself) in cAMP-dependent cell aggregation on CU. Experiments with intact cells showed no interaction between the CU and receptors, or between the CU and G-proteins. Assays on membrane preparations plus the Mn-ATP substrate, which uncouples G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase, demonstrated that activation of the cAMP pathway by CU depends primarily on the catalytic activity of the adenylyl cyclase. These investigations provide essential data for the development of biomaterials that favour cell functionality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), the cell implicated in biodegradation, also contain hydrolytic activities. Hence, in this study, an activated human MDM cell system was used to assess the biostability of a PCNU, synthesized with C-14-hexane diisocyanate (HDI) and butanediol (BD), previously shown to be susceptible to hydrolysis by cholesterol esterase (CE). Monocytes, isolated from whole blood and cultured for 14 days on polystyrene (PS) to mature MDM, were gently trypsinized and seeded onto C-14-PCNU. Radiolabel release and esterase activity, as measured with p-nitrophenylbutyrate, increased for almost 2 weeks. At 1 week, the increase in radiolabel release and esterase activity were diminished by more than 50% when the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, or the serine esterase/protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride was added to the medium. This strongly suggests that in part, it was MDM esterase activity which contributed to the PU degradation. In an effort to simulate the potential combination of oxidative and hydrolytic activities of inflammatory cells, C-14-PCNU was exposed to HOCl and then CE. Interestingly, the release of radiolabeled products by CE was significantly inhibited by the pre-treatment of PCNU with HOCl The results of this study show that while the co-existing roles of oxidation and hydrolysis in the biodegradation of PCNUs remains to be elucidated, a clear relationship is drawn for PCNU degradation to the hydrolytic degradative activities which increase in MDM during differentiation from monocytes, and during activation in the chronic phase of the inflammatory response.

The strategy employed here utilises carbene generated by illumination of diazirine to achieve covalent bonding of carbohydrates. Here, we describe the synthesis of an aryl diazirine containing a disaccharide (lactose). Surface analysis techniques [X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS)] demonstrate its successful surface immobilisation on polystyrene (PS). Results are compared to those previously obtained with an aryl diazirine containing a monosaccharide (galactose). The biological activity of galactose- or lactose-modified PS samples is studied using rat hepatocytes, Allo A lectin and solid-phase semi-synthesis with alpha -2,6-sialyltransferase. Allo A shows some binding to galactose-modified PS but none to lactose-modified surfaces. Similar results are obtained with rat hepatocytes. In contrast, sialylation of lactose-modified PS is achieved but not with galactose-modified surfaces. The different responses indicate that the biological activity depends not only on the carbohydrate per se but also on the structure and length of the spacer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Scaffolds composed of porcine tissue ECM, purified Type I collagen, poly(L)lactic coglycolic acid (PLGA), or a mixture of porcine ECM and PLGA were implanted into subcutaneous pouches on the dorsum of mice. The origin of cells that populated the matrices was determined by first performing bone marrow transplantation to convert the marrow of glucose phosphate isomerase 1b (Gpi-1(b)) mice to cells expressing glucose phosphate isomerase 1a (Gpi-1(a)). Results. A significant increase in Gpi-1(a) expressing cells was present in sites implanted with the porcine ECM compared to sites implanted with either Type I collagen or PLGA. Use of recipient mice transplanted with marrow cells that expressed beta -galactosidase confirmed that the majority of cells that populated and remodeled the naturally occurring porcine ECM were marrow derived. Addition of porcine ECM to the PLGA scaffold caused a significant increase in the number of marrow-derived cells that became part of the remodeled implant site. Conclusion. The composition of bioscaffolds affects the cellular recruitment pattern during tissue repair. ECM scaffolds facilitate the recruitment of marrow-derived cells into sites of remodeling.

Eighteen mongrel ewes, 4 +/-1 years old, were randomly divided into three groups: 6 animals served as a control group (Baseline), 6 were bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX), and the others were used as a sham-operated group (SHAM). OVX and SHAM ewes were euthanized 24 months after surgery; the L5 vertebrae were processed for mechanical and histomorphometric analyses. Maximum load, maximum strength (p <0.0005) and elastic modulus (p <0.005) decreased by about 28% in the OVX group in comparison with the other groups. In the OVX group, vertebral cancellous bone volume, trabecular thickness and trabecular number decreased by about 32% (p <0.0005), 15% (p=0.001) and 20% (p=0.019), respectively. An overall decrease in the bone turnover rate of the OVX group was registered in terms of bone formation rate (p=0.007) and activation frequency (p <0.0005). The variations observed in cancellous bone mechanics and histomorphometry would suggest the development of an osteopenic state in ewe vertebrae at 24 months. Such findings may be useful for future experimental investigations on biomaterials and prosthetic devices to be implanted in the osteopenic spine.","Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Giavaresi, G (reprint author), Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, IOR, Serv Chirurgia Sperimentale, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/J-5298-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/0000-0001-7494-9970; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,51,25,26,0,2,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The effects of different concentrations of corrosion products on the growth of rat aortic smooth muscle cells were conducted with the [H-3]thymidine uptake test and cell cycle sorter. Both the supernatant and precipitates of corrosion products were toxic to the primary culture of smooth muscle cells. The growth inhibition was correlated well with the increased nickel ions in the corrosion products when nickel concentration was above 11.7 ppm. The corrosion products also changed cell morphology and induced cell necrosis. The cell growth inhibition occurred at the G0/G1 to S transition phase. Similar to our recent study of nitinol stent wire, the present investigation also demonstrated the cytotoxicity of corrosion products of 316 L stainless steel stent wire on smooth muscle cells, which might affect the poststenting vascular response.

Their high water content and tissue-like elasticity are similar to the native extracellular matrix of many tissues. In this work, we investigated the potential of a modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel as a biomaterial for tissue engineering applications. First, the ability of NIH3T3 fibroblast cells to attach to PVA hydro-els was evaluated. Because of PVA's extremely hydrophilic nature, important cell adhesion proteins do not adsorb to PVA hydrogels, and consequently, cells are unable to adhere to the hydrogel. By covalently attaching the important cell adhesion protein fibronectin onto the PVA hydrogel surface, the rate of fibroblast attachment and proliferation was dramatically improved, and promoted two-dimensional cell migration. These studies illustrate that a fibronectin-modified PVA hydrogel is a potential biomaterial for tissue engineering applications.

Change in this function when contacting fibroblasts with various polymer microspheres was estimated using the metabolic cooperation assay system. When the cells were in contact with the microspheres after their adhesion onto a substrate, the function did not alter. However, when they were in contact with precoated microspheres on test dishes, the function was inhibited as the quantity of microspheres increased. Moreover, the inhibition level increased as the diameters of polyethylene and polystyrene microspheres decreased. However, no inhibition was observed if precoated microspheres were composed from poly(L-lactic acid). These findings suggest that the size and the material of microspheres, and how cells recognize the microspheres, are factors affecting cell function of gap junctional intercellular communication. Therefore, estimating this function may provide valuable information about the biocompatibility of many kinds of materials even in the form of particles.

Hydrogel leachouts were nontoxic to the cells, as confirmed by tetrazolium reduction (MTT) and Neutral red uptake assays. Exposure to leachouts also did not alter their functional tv as seen from normal expression of von Willebrand factor. -H-3-thymidine incorporation revealed that hydrogel leachouts did not induce endothelial cell proliferation.

The morbidity of failed fracture healing is significant and may require bone grafting. Donor site morbidity and finite amounts of autogenous bone are major drawbacks of autogenous bone grafting. Similarly, the use of allografts and xenografts may be associated with an increased risk of rejection, infection, and nonunion. To circumvent the limitations of bone grafting, research efforts have focused on formulating a suitable bone substitute. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of type I collagen implants in repairing critical sized mandibular defects in rats. Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300g) were divided equally into control and experimental groups. Full thickness, round, four millimeter in diameter defects were created in the ramus of the right mandible of all rats using an electrical burr at low speed. The defects were irrigated of all bone chips, and either filled with a precisely fitted disk of allogenic collagen type I gel (experimental animals) or left empty (control animals). Animals were killed 6 weeks after surgery and healing of the bone defects was assessed in a blinded fashion using radiologic and histologic analysis. Radiologic analysis of the control group revealed a clear circular right mandibular defect in all animals, whereas the collagen disk implant group revealed an indistinct to nonexistent right mandibular defect in all animals. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant difference between these groups (*P = 0.01). Similarly, gross analysis of control mandibles revealed a 4mm round, soft-tissue filled defect, while implanted defects demonstrated gross bone spanning the defect. Finally, histologic analysis of all control mandibles revealed clearly demarcated bony edges at the defect border with connective tissue spanning the defect. In contrast, histological analysis of all implanted mandibles revealed indistinct bony edges at the defect border with a thin layer of osteoblasts and viable bone spanning the defects. We have demonstrated the ability of type I collagen to promote healing of a membranous bony defect that would not otherwise heal at 6 weeks. The suitability of type I collagen as a carrier matrix provides ample opportunity for tissue-engineered approaches to further facilitate bony defect healing. Promoting bone formation through tissue engineering matrices offers great promise for skeletal healing and reconstruction.","Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Colagenesis Inc, Beverly, MA USA; New York Eye & Ear Infirm, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10003 USA; NYU, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10016 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Surg, Farmington, CT USA","Longaker, MT (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 269 Campus Dr,CCSR Room 1225-S, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Longaker@stanford.edu,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [R01 DE13028],,,35,30,38,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1049-2275,1536-3732,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

At constant protein concentration, a decrease of salt concentration from 0.8 to 0.085 M caused a transition of the crystal growth mechanism from two-dimensional nucleation to dislocation growth. At different, fixed concentrations of salt, the protein concentration, which does not induce multiple crystal nucleation, was increased from 8 to 60 mg/ml with corresponding increases in the tangential velocity of growth steps from 5 to 17.5 nm/s. Results from these experiments suggest that a highly concentrated protein solution, as might be found in a protein rich phase, may not induce crystal nucleation, but can promote crystal growth if screw dislocations are present in the crystal.

We are utilizing a variety of techniques for the development and implementation of detergent-specific membrane protein crystallization screens. Observation of dye partitioning in detergent/solute mixtures enables the relatively rapid determination of phase boundaries, and this information is utilized in the design of crystallization screens that are currently being tested. A commercial crystallization robot has been modified for use in the in situ setup of crystallization screens. Lastly, the characterization of critical phenomena in detergent solutions has been initiated.

In this study, we hypothesized that adhesion ligands covalently coupled to hydrogel carriers would allow one to control pre-osteoblast cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Modification of alginate with an RGD-containing peptide promoted osteoblast adhesion and spreading, whereas minimal cell adhesion was observed on unmodified hydrogels. Raising the adhesion ligand density increased osteoblast proliferation, and a minimum ligand density (1.5-15 femtomoles/cm(2)) was needed to elicit this effect. MC3T3-EI cells demonstrated increased osteoblast differentiation with the peptide-modified hydrogels, as confirmed by the up-regulation of bone-specific differentiation markers. Further, transplantation of primary rat calvarial osteoblasts revealed statistically significant increases of in vivo bone formation at 16 and 24 weeks with G(4)RGDY-modified alginate compared with unmodified alginate.

Preliminary results indicate that hydrogel coatings with either collagen I or polylysine-laminin-1 can promote cortical nerve cell attachment and differentiation on silicon substrates. Additionally, slow-release microtubules can also be implanted in these gels to release agents that either provide trophic support to neurons or prevent inflammation locally. When silicon discs are coated with collagen type I, the coating remains stable for 55 days.

This bio-artificial bone graft substitute could effectively regenerate bone tissue when it was implanted in vivo. Porous artificial bone material treated with a small amount of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and perfused with marrow mesenchymal cells also markedly stimulated bone regeneration by the interaction between the cells and BMP. Similarly, when an artificial dermis made of collagen sponge was perfused with marrow mesenchymal cells and used to cover a skin defect, the regeneration of blood vessels was stimulated.

As the basis for modem internal fixation of fractures, these principles are presently supported by the majority of orthopedic surgeons. However, with recent advances in bioengineering and biomaterials, it has become necessary to reconsider these principles. We focused our attention on cerclage fixation, which is not considered so important by the AO group, and developed two new cerclage materials. One is a nylon strap that is in wide industrial use. In the field of orthopedics, Partridge first employed the nylon strap for internal fixation and demonstrated its efficacy in 1976. However, its use was thereafter discontinued because of various complications. We developed a nylon strap for temporary fracture fixation and demonstrated its efficacy in clinical studies. We also developed a bioabsorbable thread for the tight tying of bones. Bone fixation with a thread is sometimes used clinically, but adequate fixation often cannot be obtained because of loosening of the knot. Therefore, we prepared a blended thread by mixing poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and epsilon -polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber, so that it could be fixed tightly by melting. The fatigue strength of this thread was higher than that of a stainless-steel wire with the same cross-sectional area. We are aiming to establish more effective and convenient methods of treatment by developing new bone fixation materials and examining their efficacy. In the future treatment of fractures, it will be important to develop new instruments and bone fixation materials for the purpose of standardizing the procedures used by surgeons.

A new method of preparing porous scaffolds composed of synthetic biodegradable polymers was developed by combining porogen leaching and freeze-drying techniques using preprepared ice particulates as the porogen material. The pore structures of the polymer sponges could be manipulated by controlling processing variables such as the sized and weight fraction of the ice particulates and the polymer concentration. The synthetic polymer sponges were further hybridized with collagen microsponges to prepare biodegradable hybrid porous sponges of synthetic polymer and collagen. The collagen microsponges were formed in the pores of synthetic polymer sponges. The hybrid sponges exhibited the advantages of both the synthetic polymers and collagen. Hybrid sponges of synthetic polymer, collagen, and inorganic hydroxyapatite were developed by depositing hydroxyapatite particulates on the surfaces of the collagen microsponges in the synthetic polymer-collagen sponges. The use of synthetic polymer sponge as a mechanical skeleton facilitated the formation of these hybrid sponges into desired shapes, contributed good mechanical strength and handling, while the collagen and hydroxyapatite facilitated cell seeding and promoted cell interaction.

An alternative would be a hybrid or tissue-engineered graft with the surface coated with a monolayer of the patient's own cells. Currently, to be effective, high-density seeding regimens have to be undertaken. This is because endothelial cells (ECs) are washed off the graft lumen once exposed to physiological blood flow. EC attachment has been shown to be significantly improved by pre-coating with substances known to attach ECs selectively.

Of a total of 2663 explanted POOLS, 586 were foldable lenses and 2077 were rigid PMMA lenses The most frequent reason for explantation of all 2663 IOLs studied was decentration/dislocation. Optic and haptic damage and posterior capsule rupture were significantly more often a reason for explantation in several foldable designs compared to rigid PCIOLs. Whereas rigid designs lead more often to corneal decompensation. The percentage of explanted IOLs because of inflammatory reactions decreased significantly from 1994 to 2000. Conclusions. The complication profiles of rigid and foldable IOLs revealed some apparent differences due to the nature of the IOL biomaterials and designs. IOL optic/haptic damage was a common complication for foldable IOLs,whereas it was only discovered in single digits for rigid PMMA IOLs. The possible explanation for this is,that the soft and flexible biomaterials,from which all the foldable IOLs were manufactured, are easier to be damaged during folding, unfolding and insertion procedure. In our opinion this relative disadvantage of foldable IOLs is by far outweighed by the numerous advantages of the small incision cataract surgery. The decreasing inflammatory reactions can be explained by advances in surgical techniques, especially the secure in-the-bag fixation of IOLs.","Med Univ S Carolina, Storm Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Res Ocular Therapeut & Biodevices, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; Univ Homburg, Augenklin, Poliklin, D-6650 Homburg, Germany; Univ Heidelberg, Augenklin, Poliklin, Heidelberg, Germany","Apple, DJ (reprint author), Med Univ S Carolina, Storm Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Res Ocular Therapeut & Biodevices, 167 Ashley Ave,POB 250676, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.",,,,,,,22,10,10,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0941-293X,,,OPHTHALMOLOGE,Ophthalmologe,NOV,2001.0,98,11,,,,,1029,1035,,10.1007/s003470170021,,,,7,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,496VP,WOS:000172418000004,11729733.0,,,,2019-02-25

The present paper describes the cellulose formation using Acetobacter xylinum and D-glucose as C-source. Kinetic investigations of the biosynthesis, methods of purification, and morphological investigations of the formed cellulose are reviewed and demonstrated by own results. The properties of the bacterial cellulose are quite different from those of plant celluloses. That especially concerns the ultrafine network architecture, high hydrophilicity, and mouldability during formation. BActerial SYnthesized Cellulose (BASYC((R))) was designed tubularly directly during the cultivation with the aim to develop biomaterials for medical application. These formed products were applicated as covers in experimental micronerve surgery and - most important - as artificial blood vessel interpositions with inner diameter of about 1 mm. High mechanical strength in wet state, enormous water retention values, low roughness of the inner surface, and a complete 'vitalization' of BASYC((R)) - microvessel-interpositions in rat experiments demonstrate the high potential of BASYC((R)) as an artificial blood vessel in microsurgery.

A special emphasis is placed on the controlled modification reactions to prepare chitin derivatives with well-defined structures and thereby to construct sophisticated molecular architecture having various advanced functions. The reactions discussed here include hydrolysis of main chain, deacetylation, acylation, N-phthaloylation of chitosan, tosylation, alkylation, Schiff base formation, reductive alkylation, O-carboxymethylation, N-carboxyalkylation, silylation, and graft copolymerization. For conducting modification reactions in a facile and controlled manner, some soluble chitin derivatives are convenient. Of soluble precursors reported, N-phthaloyl-chitosan has proved particularly useful and made possible series of regioselective and quantitative substitutions thus far difficult. One of the important achievements based on this organosoluble precursor is the synthesis of nonnatural branched polysaccharides that have sugar branches at a specific site of the linear chitin or chitosan backbone.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed on these two materials for an application to plastic transport pallets. Transport pallets reinforced with China reed fibre prove to be ecologically advantageous if they have a minimal lifetime of 3 years compared with the 5-year lifetime of the conventional pallet. The energy consumption and other environmental impacts are strongly reduced by the use of raw renewable fibres, due to three important factors: (a) the substitution of glass fibre production by the natural fibre production; (b) the indirect reduction in the use of polypropylene linked to the higher proportion of China reed fibre used and (c) the reduced pallet weight, which reduces fuel consumption during transport. Considering the whole life cycle, the polypropylene production process and the transport cause the strongest environmental impacts during the use phase of the life cycle. Since thermoplastic composites are hardly biodegradable, incineration has to be preferred to discharge on landfills at the end of its useful life cycle. The potential advantages of the renewable fibres will be effective only if a purer fibre extraction is obtained to ensure an optimal material stiffness, a topic for further research. China reed biofibres are finally compared with other usages of biomass, biomaterials, in general, can enable a three to ten times more efficient valorisation of biomass than mere heat production or biofuels for transport.

The evolution of biofilms in 28 catheters (umbilical or central) implanted in 24 newborns for prematurity was studied by SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In 4 of 24 patients, SEM examination revealed the presence of Candida in form of yeast or hyphae. In one of these patients, TEM confirmed the presence of organisms. In each case, hemoculture and culture of the catheter itself confirmed the diagnosis.

MAPLE involves dissolving or suspending the biomaterial in a volatile solvent, freezing the mixture to create a solid target, and using a low fluence pulsed laser to evaporate the target for deposition of the solute inside a vacuum system. Using simple shadow masks, i.e. lines, dots and arrays, pattern features with length scales as small as 20 mum can be deposited using multiple materials on different types of substrates. MDW uses pulsed laser to directly transfer material from a ribbon to a substrate. Patterns with a spatial resolution of similar to 10 mum can be written directly. Biomaterials ranging from polyethylene glycol to eukaryotic cells, i.e. Chinese hamster ovaries, were deposited with no measurable damage to their structures or genotype. Deposits of immobilized horseradish peroxidase, an enzyme, in the form of a polymer composite with a protective coating, i.e. polyurethane, retained their enzymatic functions. A dopamine electrochemical sensor was fabricated by MDW using a natural tissues/graphite composite. These examples and the unique features of MAPLE and MDW for biosensor fabrication have been discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Results showed that they are not susceptible to galvanic corrosion when Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V are simultaneously used in an assembled part in the pure corrosion condition, but the fretting surfaces will become more vulnerable to galvanic corrosion. Acceleration of anodic dissolution of the fretted area is dominated by the ""large cathode effect"". Ti-6Al-4V acts as a cathode with respect to the non-contact area of the Co-Cr-Mo alloy. For fretting pairs composed of the same alloy, galvanic corrosion can also take place on the non-contact area which will act as the ""large-area"" cathode. The fretting corrosion mechanism of two biomaterials has been proposed based upon observations of the topography of the fretted scars as well as other corrosion information.

Skin trauma involves damage to the epidermal, dermal and/or subdermal tissues. Epithelial, dermal and full-thickness replacements are considered. Cartilage research is mainly focused on replacing hyaline cartilage. Researchers investigate both nondegradable polymers, which must provide mechanical stability, and degradable polymers, which must support cartilage regeneration. Natural healing in large bone defects often fails. Materials for bone reconstruction must be biocompatible, offer mechanical properties similar to those of bone and support tissue regeneration. The area of vascular grafts draws attention as improvements to the patency of existing materials are needed. Studies to improve current vascular graft polymers as well as develop new polymers are reviewed below. The design and testing of materials for nerve regeneration, to repair damage caused by illness or accident, is an active area of research. Directional nerve guidance via tubulation is discussed, as are matrix materials to enhance axonal extension. Finally, liver transplantation remains one of the only options for chronic liver disease and the demand for liver transplants far exceeds the number of available organs. The complexity of parameters involved in liver regeneration is presented here. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14), the elastic constant s(55) and the dielectric permittivity 8(11), were measured for the anionic collagen and collagen-HA films. The thermal analysis shows that the denaturation endotherm is at 59.47 degreesC for the collagen sample. The collagen-HA composite film shows two transitions, at 48.9 and 80.65 degreesC. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the collagen film shows a broad band characteristic of an amorphous material. The main peaks associated to the crystalline HA is present in the sample of collagen-HA. In the collagen-HA composite, one can also notice the presence of other peaks with low intensities which is an indication of the formation of other crystalline phases of apatite. The scanning electron photomicrograph of anionic collagen membranes shows very thin bundles of collagen. The scanning electron photomicrography of collagen-HA film also show deposits of hydroxyapatite on the collagen fibers forming larger bundles and suggesting that a collagenous structure of reconstituted collagen fibers could act as nucleators for the formation of apatite crystal similar to those of bone. The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14) was measured for the anionic collagen, with a value of 0.062 pC N-1, which is in good agreement compared with values reported in the literature obtained with other techniques. For the collagen-HA composite membranes, a slight decrease of the value of the piezoelectricity (0.041 pC N-1) was observed.

MAPS combines homogeneous surface derivatization of a polymer to introduce a reactive functional group followed by reactive microcontact printing (mu CP) of a biological ligand of interest, linked to an appropriate reactive group. We demonstrate here that polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) films can be successfully modified to introduce COOH groups on their surfaces, which can be subsequently patterned by reactive mu CP of amine-terminated biotin after derivatization. of the COOH groups with pentafluorophenol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) confirmed the chemistry of MAPS at each stage of the derivatization of the polymer surfaces and reactive mu CP of biotin. Micropatterned biotin surfaces fabricated by MAPS were patterned with streptavidin by exploiting molecular recognition between biotin and streptavidin. The formation of streptavidin patterns was examined by fluorescence microscopy of Alexa488-labeled streptavidin and by TOF-SIMS imaging of N-15-labeled recombinant streptavidin, bound to biotin patterns. The contrast in the streptavidin micropatterns was optimized by examining the effect of blocking agents and streptavidin incubation time.

Furthermore, the degradation rate was much faster than that of PGP and could be regulated by adjusting PSTP content due to the catalyze effect of acidic products of PSTP. PGP/PSTP blends could be a series of potential biomaterials for drug controlled release.","Zhejiang Univ, Coll Pharmaceut Sci, Hangzhou 310006, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China","Qiu, LY (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Pharmaceut Sci, Hangzhou 310006, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,11,1,1,0,1,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3304,,,ACTA POLYM SIN,Acta Polym.

A biosensor basically consists of a transducer in conjunction with a biologically active molecule that converts a biochemical signal into a quantifiable electric response. The specificity of the biosensor depends on the selection of the biomaterial. Enzymes, antibodies, DNA, receptors, organelles, microorganisms as well as animal and plant cells or tissues have been used as biologic sensing materials. Advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and immunochemistry are expected to lead to a rapid expansion in the range of biologic recognition elements to be used in the field of biosensors. Biomaterials that are stable and function even in highly acidic, alkaline, hydrophobic, or oxidizing environments as well as stable to high temperature and immune to toxic substrates in the processing stream will play an important role. Techniques for immobilization of the biomaterials have played a significant role in the biosensor field. Immobilization not only brings about the intimate contact of the biologic catalysts with the transducer, but also helps in the stabilization of the biologic system, thus enhancing its operational and storage stability. A number of techniques have been developed in our laboratory for the immobilization of enzymes, multienzyme systems, cells, and enzyme-cell conjugates. Some of these aspects that are of significance in biosensor applications have been highlighted.","Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Nucl Agr & Biotechnol Div, Trombay 400085, Mumbai, India","D'Souza, SF (reprint author), Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Nucl Agr & Biotechnol Div, Trombay 400085, Mumbai, India.",,,,,,,102,61,61,0,29,HUMANA PRESS INC,TOTOWA,"999 RIVERVIEW DRIVE SUITE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512 USA",0273-2289,,,APPL BIOCHEM BIOTECH,Appl.

Bone tissue engineering holds great promise in providing strategies that will result in complete regeneration of bone and restoration of its function. Currently, such strategies include the transplantation of highly porous scaffolds seeded with cells. Prior to transplantation the seeded cells are cultured in vitro in order for the cells to proliferate, differentiate and generate extracellular matrix. Factors that can affect cellular function include the cell-biomaterial interaction, as well as the biochemical and the mechanical environment. To optimize culture conditions, good understanding of these parameters is necessary. The new developments in bone biology, bone cell mechanotransduction, and cell-surface interactions are reviewed here to demonstrate that bone mechanotransduction is strongly influenced by the biomaterial properties.

With regard to (1) whether the induced bone would disappear with time due to the absence of mechanical stresses and (2) whether this heterotopically formed bone would give rise to uncontrolled growth, a long-time investigation of porous hydroxyapatite ceramic (HA), porous biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic (TCP/HA, BCP), porous alpha -tricalcium phosphate ceramic (alpha -TCP) and porous beta -tricalcium phosphate ceramic (beta -TCP) was performed in dorsal muscles of dog, for 2.5 years. Histological observation, backscattered scanning electron microscopy observation and histomorphometric analysis were made on thin un-decalcified sections of retrieved samples. Normal compact bone with bone marrow was found in all HA implants (n = 4) and in all BCP implants (n = 4), 48 +/- 4% pore area was filled with bone in HA implants and 41 +/- 2% in BCP implants. Bone-like tissue, which was a mineralised bone matrix with osteocytes but lacked osteoblasts and bone marrow, was found in all beta -TCP implants (n = 4) and in one of the four alpha -TCP implants. Both normal bone and bone-like tissues were confined inside the pores of the implants. The results show that calcium phosphate ceramics are osteoinductive in muscles of dogs, Although the quality and quantity varied among different ceramics, the induced bone in both HA and BCP ceramics did neither disappear nor grow uncontrollably during the period as long as 2.5 years.

Fully polymerized polyurethanes (a polyurea-polyurethane and a polycarbonate polyurethane) were modified (post-polymerization) with bromoalkylation of the hard segments followed by attachment of a bisphosphonate group at the bromine site. These bisphosphonate-polyurethanes resisted calcification in rat 60 day subdermal implants compared to nonmodified control polyurethane implants, that calcify. Bisphosphonates-modified polyurethanes were also studied in circulatory implants using a pulmonary valve cusp replacement model in sheep. Polyurethane cusps modified with bisphosphonate did not calcify in 90 day implants, compared to control polyurethane cusps implants, that demonstrated nodular surface oriented calcific deposits. It is concluded that bisphosphonate modified polyurethanes resist calcification both in subdermal implants and in the circulation. This novel biomaterial approach offers great promise for long-term blood stream implantation with calcification resistance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The anticoagulant potential of these derivatives was estimated with common clotting assays, such as thrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. It was found that a pronounced anticoagulant activity of cellulose derivatives could be achieved if the degree of substitution (DS) with sulfate was above 1.0. The anticoagulant activity was maximal at a DS of about 1.5 and then decreased again. Further, it was detected that particularly sulfation in C2-position resulted in a pronounced anticoagulant activity of cellulose derivatives. Development and application of assays specific for thrombin and factor Xa indicated that the anticoagulant potential of these cellulose derivatives was mainly due to anti-thrombin activity. The comparison of cellulose sulfates and cellulose derivatized with phosphate and quaternary ammonium groups demonstrated that the negative charge and type of the substituent is an important prerequisite for the anticoagulant activity of cellulose derivatives. Indeed, derivatization with sulfate produced superior activity in comparison with phosphate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The tissue was tested biaxially using a hydraulic simulator that subjected it to increasing stress until rupture. One hundred eighty trials were performed, 36 with unsutured pericardium and four series of 36 trials each with pericardium sutured with silk, Prolene, nylon or Gore-Tex. The samples were tested in pairs from three different pericardial regions. One sample from each pair (the predictive specimen) was assessed according to morphological and mechanical criteria, while the other (the predicted or selectable specimen) was subjected only to morphological analysis. The findings show that ostrich pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde according to standard methods has an excellent resistance to rupture in biaxial testing, withstanding stresses of up to 100 M Pa, and never lower than 30 M Pa. Its resistance to rupture is lowered by suturing, a loss that is less pronounced when silk sutures are used. The results with Gore-Tex are very homogeneous and the elastic behavior of the pericardium/suture unit appears to be similar to that of unsutured tissue, suggesting that the interaction between the two biomaterials is minor. Similar results were observed in the series sutured with Prolene and nylon. The use of paired samples makes it possible to closely estimate the mechanical behavior of the tissue in a given zone by determining that of its mate. The statistical study shows that this estimation is not conditioned by the suture employed, thus validating this approach and providing more precise criteria for tissue selection.

The chemical treatments used to stabilize the tissue employed are considered to play a fundamental role in the development of these two phenomena, although the problem is multifactorial and the underlying causes are yet to be fully identified. Currently, there is an ongoing search for chemical treatments capable of reducing or eliminating the process of calcification while preserving the mechanoelastic characteristics of the tissue. One of the approaches to this effort is the elimination of the phospholipid component from the biological tissue employed in prosthesis construction. There is evidence that this component may be responsible for the precipitation of calcium salts. The present study compares two delipidating chemical treatments involving chloroform/methanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with the use of glutaraldehyde (GA) alone. For this purpose, porcine pericardial tissue was subjected to tensile strength testing employing a hydraulic simulator. A total of 234 samples were studied 90 treated with GA, 72 treated with chloroform/methanol and 72 treated with SDS. The mean breaking strength was significantly higher in the samples treated with GA (between 43.29 and 63.01 MPa) when compared with those of tissue treated with chloroform/methanol (29.92-42.30MPa) or with SDS (13.49-19.06MPa). In a second phase of the study, selection criteria based on morphological and mechanical factors were applied to the pericardial membranes employing a system of paired samples. The mathematical analysis of the findings in one fragment will aid in determining the mechanical behavior of its adjacent twin sample. In conclusion, the anticalcification chemical treatments tested in the experimental model conferred a lesser mechanical resistance than that obtained with GA. On the other hand, the utilization of paired samples was found to be useful in the prediction of the mechanical behavior of porcine pericardial tissue. Nevertheless, in order for our method of selection to be considered the most adequate approach, it will be necessary to validate these findings in dynamic studies involving a real, functional model.

Therefore, thrombotic occlusion is the predominant cause for the failure of small diameter vascular grafts made out of Dacron or Teflon. To reduce surface thrombogenicity of material surfaces used for vascular implants, in vitro seeding of endothelial cells using adhesive protein matrix is under evaluation in various laboratories. Evidences suggest that fibrin matrix is a suitable matrix for endothelial cell (EC) adhesion to the currently available vascular graft materials; however, poor proliferation of attached cells seems to be a major limitation. During this study we have also found that fibrin is a better matrix compared to gelatin to support cell attachment and spreading. However, the poor proliferation of initially attached human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) necessitated modification of the matrix composition to get a monolayer within a limited period. Since fibrin can form a network of protein bundles, an effort is made to incorporate growth factors within the matrix. Endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) isolated from bovine hypothalamus is immobilized on the surface with fibrin glue (FG) to promote proliferation of HUVEC. The results demonstrate that proteins with similar molecular weights as growth factors (GF) are retained within the matrix and released into the culture medium for 96 h, in quantities that would be sufficient to promote cell proliferation. When cells were seeded on the matrix composed with components of FG and ECGF, the HUVEC proliferated at a significantly higher rate compared to the cells on surfaces coated with gelatin or fibrin. The EC thus grown on the composite (FG + ECGF) resisted the shear stress as compared to the cells grown on gelatin. The HUVEC monolayer grown on the composite seems thromboresistant as adhesion and activation of platelets are negligible after platelet rich plasma is incubated with the monolayer for about 1 h with agitation. Therefore, the composite of fibrin and ECGF can be a suitable matrix for further evaluation of patients' autologous endothelial cell attachment and proliferation for clinical application.

A therapeutic agent in the form of a drug can be added to the biomaterial by encapsulation into microparticles to protect the active agent, control its release and preserve the material rheological properties. Poly(epsilon -caprolactone) was used in this study because of its biocompatibility and resorbability, as tested in orthopaedic implants and surgical sutures. Particles (80-200 mum) were manufactured by a solvent evaporation-extraction process (1 g of polymer, 11-15 ml methylene chloride, with a stirring speed of 400-600 rpm) and introduced into the IBS in a 5-50% (V/V) range. Injectability was evaluated by texture analysis. With less than 45% of particles, the material had rheological properties similar to those of the reference IBS, whereas injectability decreased markedly with more than 45% of particles. A preliminary in vitro release study showed that this type of triphasic IBS could be efficient for drug delivery systems with osteoconduction properties.

However, the precise effects of glass-reinforced HA on the growth and functions of bone cells are still unclear. The present study has therefore examined the response of human osteoblast-like cells to HA and HA reinforced with two different proportions of glass, namely 2.5% and 5%. All materials enabled the cells to attach and proliferate during 7 days in culture and, although the growth was less than on control plastic surfaces, there was no deleterious effect of the 5% glass composite compared with HA alone. Flow cytometry analysis showed that there was no effect on cell size and granularity, but there were marked and highly selective changes in the expression of certain connective tissue proteins. Thus, while bone sialoprotein and osteonectin were down-regulated on HA alone, the expression of these antigens was relatively enhanced on the composite materials, and collagen type I was also up-regulated on the glass-reinforced HA. Thus, modulation of the glass composition of HA materials could be used to produce not only improved mechanical strength, but also enhanced biocompatibility. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Emphasis is placed on advanced fluorescence methods that can provide unique information on sol-gel-derived composite materials. The discussion begins with a description of the different fluorescent probes that have been used to study sol-gel materials. The application of fluorescence methods to examine Class I and Class II hybrid materials is then described, highlighting the specific information available from different probes and the methods used to obtain information on the structure and dynamics of such materials. This section highlights the overall effects of dispersed and bound organic dopants on the polarity, dynamics, heterogeneity, and surface chemistry of nanocomposites. Finally, fluorescence studies on emerging materials, including templated nanocomposites and biomaterials, are described, and the overall utility of fluorescence spectroscopy for probing of such materials is discussed.","McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada","Brennan, JD (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada.",,,,,,,110,93,94,1,30,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Neocartilage disks as much as 1.5 mm thick were produced, which were characterized by synthesis of the normal articular cartilage collagens and proteoglycans. In contrast to growth in serum-containing media, chondrocytes from juveniles maintained in static culture under defined serum-free conditions deposited an extracellular matrix that accumulated in the form of tissue disks. Electron microscopic evaluation of neocartilage disks revealed collagenous matrices characteristic of articular cartilage from human infants. The neocartilage did not show terminal chondrocyte differentiation as shown by the absence of Type X collagen production and lack of cellular hypertrophy. Although chondrocytes from preadolescent donor cartilage recapitulated embryonic development in the absence of exogenous factors, chondrocytes from articular cartilage from adults failed to produce neocartilage when grown under identical conditions. This is the first demonstration that autocrine morphogens are sufficient to guide production of hyaline cartilage in vitro. In addition to providing a unique model system to compare the healing response of mature and immature articular chondrocytes, this technology may be of clinical importance in the development of new biomaterials for repair of articular cartilage defects.","Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, Div Renal, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, Dept Cell Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Adkisson, HD (reprint author), Isto Technol Inc, 1139 Olivette Execut Pkwy St, St Louis, MO 63132 USA.",,"Davis, Elaine/F-3449-2012",,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR39561, AR41677]",,,62,41,41,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Tissue engineering is a relatively new but rapidly growing field that has sought to use combinations of implanted cells, biomaterials, and biologically active molecules to repair or regenerate injured or diseased tissues. Despite many advances, tissue engineers have faced significant challenges in repairing or replacing tissues that serve a predominantly biomechanical function, such as articular cartilage. An evolving discipline termed functional tissue engineering seeks to address these challenges by emphasizing and evaluating the role of biomechanical factors in the intrinsic and engineered repair of tissues and organs. In the current study, the authors describe some of the fundamental issues involving the interaction of biomechanical stresses in vivo and in vitro with native and repair articular cartilage and with other biomechanically functional tissues. A more thorough and formal investigation of these issues may provide a basis for developing rational design principles for tissue engineered replacement or repair of load-bearing structures in the body.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Orthopaed Res Labs, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Aerosp Engn & Engn Mech, Noyes Giannestras Biomech Labs, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; Univ Michigan, Orthopaed Res Labs, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Guilak, F (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Orthopaed Res Labs, Dept Surg, Box 3093,375 MSRB, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR20557, AR46574, AR43876]; NIA NIH HHS [AG15768]; NIDCR NIH HHS [DE13014]",,,106,121,126,2,18,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-921X,1528-1132,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Numerous methods have been devised to augment its natural heating response, but these methods generally lead to filling of the defect with fibrous tissue or fibrocartilage, which lacks the mechanical characteristics of articular cartilage and fails with time. Recently, tissue engineering has emerged as a new discipline that amalgamates aspects from biology, engineering, materials science, and surgery and that has as a goal the fabrication of functional new tissues to replace damaged tissues. The emergence of tissue engineering has facilitated the generation of new concepts and the revival of old ideas all of which has allowed a fresh approach to the repair or regeneration of tissues such as cartilage. The collaborations between scientists with different backgrounds and expertise has allowed the identification of some key principles that serve as the basis for the development of therapeutic approaches that now are less empiric and more hypothesis-driven than ever before. The current authors review some of the considerations regarding the various models used to test and validate the above repair methods and to address different aspects of the cartilage repair paradigm. Also, some key principles identified from past and current research, the need for the development of new biomaterials, and considerations in scale-up of cell-biomaterial constructs are summarized.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Sch Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Univ Hosp Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Goldberg, VM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Sch Med, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,"Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,45,80,82,1,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-921X,1528-1132,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

The respiratory burst of surface-adhering leukocytes may thus be a key event in the understanding of biomaterial interaction with tissues, and the aim of this review is to highlight this field of research.

This article reviews the results and conclusions obtained by several studies investigating the hemocompatibility, in vitro biocompatibility, inflammatory response, and in vivo tissue reactions of these two reference materials. Variable results obtained with LDPE and PDMS in ex vivo hemocompatibility studies were attributed to the type of animal model used, the flow velocity of the circulating blood, the time of exposure, and the methodology used to measure blood cell adhesion or activation at the surface of the materials. In contrast, both the LDPE and PDMS appeared to be suitable reference materials when used in in vitro biocompatibility, inflammatory response, and in vivo studies. However, caution must be taken when interpreting the results, because gamma sterilization of these two materials as well as their origin (for example PDMS) are two critically important factors. In conclusion, we see a definite need for standardized hemocompatible parameters and better high-quality hemocompatibility studies on PRM. This review also suggests other materials as potential PRM candidates, namely, Biomer((R)) and Intra-medic (TM) polyethylene.

Currently different types of biomaterial particles are being developed as bone-substitute materials. Before these biomaterials can be applied their mechanical and biological behavior should be characterized. In this study the time-dependent mechanical behavior of biomaterial particles with different tri-calcium-phosphate/hydroxy-apatite (TCP:HA) ratios, particle sizes, and porosities is determined and compared to the behavior of human bone grafts, the latter being the standard material currently used to augment bone defects. The mechanical properties were assessed with the use of dynamic confined compression creep tests with a loading and unloading phase. Different graft material groups were tested, consisting of 100% human bone grafts, 100% biomaterial particles, and 50:50 weight mixtures of human grafts and biomaterial particles. No damage to the particles was observed by the impaction in the test chamber or by the dynamic load. Relative to the human graft material, the biomaterial particles hardly deformed under loading, were much stiffer, and showed almost no viscoelastic behavior. The mixtures showed intermediate results. Particle size and porosity influenced the behavior of the biomaterial particles. TCP:HA ratio did not have a great effect. The conclusion is that the application of these particles should be done with great care, as their mechanical behavior is drastically different than that of the human graft material. Mixing it with human bone grafts gave the material some biphasic, viscoelastic behavior that may be important for its biological response.

Increased susceptibility to infection at these surgical sites appears to be associated with defective local phagocytic killing. The mechanisms for neutrophil down-regulation, however, continue to be obscure. We have recently demonstrated that cytotoxic substances are released from granulocytes associated with materials. One group of releasants, the cationic human neutrophil peptide(s) (also called defensins) not only impairs the antimicrobial capacity of the granulocyte that releases it but also impairs bystander phagocytes. Because plasma or matrix proteins soon become associated with implants, we investigated the interactive effect of adding these proteins, singly and in combination, on the microbicidal effect of bystander cells. Some plasma/matrix proteins (whole plasma, albumin, fibrinogen, and fibronectin) strongly interfered with the anti-microbicidal effects generated by neutrophil-polystyrene interaction. Other proteins (vitronectin and laminin) were without effect. These results suggest that protein composition at the prosthetic implant site could have a significant effect on infectivity, depending on whether neutrophils releasants were attenuated. In the absence of attenuation, the local environment would be hostile to host defenses, permitting bacterial survival and proliferation.

These PPy-coated fabrics, PPy-Phos and PPy-Plas, were sterilized with ethylene oxide (EO) and the following characterizations were performed: surface morphology by scanning electron microscope, EO residuals analysis by the headspace method, acute systemic toxicity in the mouse model, hemolysis, blood coagulation time, viability and proliferation of endothelial cells measured with the WST-1 method, and activation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells indicated by the specific expression of interleukin 8 mRNA measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Virgin polyester fabrics, expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE), and medical-grade Bionate(R) 80A poly(carbonate urethane) were used as references in the cell culture experiments. The PPy-coated fabrics revealed different surface morphologies by showing more PPy lamina and clusters on the PPy-Plas. Neither of the PPy-coated fabrics had an adverse effect on hemolysis and coagulation time, and they did not cause any acute systemic toxicity. The EO residual level was as low as 5 ppm or less, which is considered quite acceptable. Although exhibiting a relatively low initial cell adhesion at 24 h, the two PPy-coated samples showed no cytotoxicity at 72 and 168 h. Bionate(R) 80A and ePTFE recorded cytotoxicity at 72 and 168 h, respectively. The virgin fabrics also demonstrated a decrease of viable cells at 72 h that was not significant. The activation of PMN cells induced by both PPy-coated fabrics, the ePTFE, and the negative control was significantly lower than that induced by their respective tumor necrosis factor-alpha controls. These results therefore highlighted the potential of PPy-coated fabrics for use as cardiovascular prostheses. It was suggested that cell adhesion moieties should be incorporated into the PPy/fabric composite to increase cell adhesion and subsequent cell proliferation.

We established an in vitro cell culture model with three-dimensional scaffolds (cubes of 0.7 x 0.7 x 1.0 cm) of porous bone substitutes to investigate proliferation and differentiation rates of SaOS-2 cells. The cultures were analyzed for individual cell morphology after 5 days of growing using scanning electron microscopy. Fracture preparations of the cubes showed that cells could infiltrate the porous structures, but the cell shapes varied from individual round-shaped cells to wide spread cells and cell clusters, depending on the material. Also, the differentiation of the seeded cells was dissimilar after a 5-day incubation. The specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity (ALP/ DNA) measured in the supernatants of alpha -TCP-grown cells was nine times higher than the lowest activity, as observed by cells incubated on GB9N. Early (Collagen1, ALP) and late marker (osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein) of osteoblastic differentiation were proofed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cells grown on bone substitutes and bioglass seem to be less differentiated than alpha -TCP-grown cells, because of noticeably less amounts of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. The cultivation on GB9N seems to dedifferentiate the cells, because even the ALP expression was reduced as well. Our results indicate that distinct bone substitutes influence proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells in different manners. These results might influence the selection of an adequate bone substitute for clinical use as well, part from degradative and biomechanical properties.

Setting: Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices, Department of Ophthalmology, Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Methods: Five groups of rigid and foldable IOLs were analyzed in an in vitro test for the percentage of silicone oil adherence: a single-piece foldable hydrophilic-acrylic IOL (n = 9); a single-piece rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOL with HSM coating of the lens optic (n = 9); a 3-piece foldable silicone optic IOL with HSM coating of the optic (n = 10); a single-piece standard rigid PMMA IOL (n = 7); and a standard 3-piece foldable silicone optic IOL (n = 9). After the IOLs were immersed in water and then in silicone oil, gross photographs taken. Image analysis was performed to evaluate the percentage of silicone oil coverage of the anterior and posterior surfaces of each IOL optic. Results: The mean silicone oil coverage of the hydrophilic-acrylic IOLs was 5.6% +/- 2.5% (SID); of the HSM PMMA IOLs, 6.2% +/- 4.3%; of the HSM silicone optic IOLs, 6.7% +/- 3.2%; and of the standard PMMA IOLs, 20.3% +/- 13.3%. The mean silicone oil coverage was greatest on the standard silicone optic IOLs, 98.2% +/- 3.1 %. Conclusions: Intraocular lenses with a hydrophilic optic have less tendency toward adherence to silicone oil than more hydrophobic designs. A foldable silicone IOL with heparin surface modification can significantly reduce potential silicone oil adherence, comparable to the level achievable with the rigid HSM PMMA designs. Two new foldable IOL styles, the HSM silicone IOL and IOLs in the general class of hydrophilic-acrylic, were highly efficacious in reducing silicone oil adherence. There is now a real choice of foldable lenses for patients with actual or potential vitreoretinal diseases.

At the same time, these models are not representative of many real (and particularly anatomical) materials. As a result, new nonlinear models have been developed by Fung and other researchers for biomaterials. However before them, one of the generalized model of viscoelasticity has been developed by Knopoff and MacDonald. Here this model is considered and applied for evaluation of blood vessel wall characteristics. Unlike the convenient models, this model is based on fundamental thermodynamic concepts, and takes into account some more realistic features of viscoelastic solids.

Higher temperature TSDC spectra (250-350 K) provided the alpha relaxation peaks associated with the glass transition temperature. The direct signal analysis (DSA) method allowed the deconvolution of the peaks into elementary processes and the determination of their mean relaxation parameters. The variations in the low and high temperature polarization with the number of backbone methylene groups were interpreted as a combination of flexibility and entanglement phenomena.

Furthermore, known literature and new results about platelet adhesion on regioselectively modified polysaccharides such as HE, chitosan with HE-like functional groups, and sulfated cellulose are presented in two different perfusion systems at different shear rates. Regioselectively modified polysaccharides were tested as coatings of two polymers. The strongest influence on platelet adhesion was observed when the three regioselectively modified polysaccharides contained 6-O-sulfo- groups. No or little influence was seen with 3-O-sulfo- groups. A variable effect on platelet adhesion was found in position 2. N-sulfo- groups in HE induced a medium platelet adhesion, and O-sulfo- groups of iduronic acid moiety in HE induced none. Cellulose containing 2-O-sulfo- groups induced little platelet adhesion, and 2-N-sulfo- groups in chitosan induced a variable platelet adhesion response, depending on the N-SO3/NAc ratio. Preliminary plasma protein adhesion measurements on immobilized HE derivatives with four different fluorescence-labeled plasma proteins showed a regioselective influence with serum albumin and fibrinogen. 6-O-desulfated HE gave the strongest reduction in protein adsorption followed by N-desulfation and 2-O-desulfation; the lowest reduction was observed with 3-O-desulfation. Tailor-made athrombogenic coatings of HE should not carry high amounts of 6-O-sulfo- groups or of N-sulfo- groups. Regioselectively modified cellulose and chitosan may become suitable for tailor-made athrombogenic biomaterials when regioselective reactions are further optimized.","Univ Aachen, ITMC, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Baumann, H (reprint author), Univ Aachen, ITMC, Worringer Weg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",Baumann@RWTH-Aachen.de,,,,,,61,10,15,0,3,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"333 SEVENTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10001 USA",0094-6176,1098-9064,,SEMIN THROMB HEMOST,Semin.

This paper critically reviews methodological approaches and presents aspects of this research. Selected examples presented include micro and nanostructure and properties of biomaterials surfaces, molecular level interactions at biomaterial-biomolecule interfaces, interfaces between biomaterials and mineralised tissues as well as advances of mineralised tissue research. In these areas, AFM is shown to be a useful and versatile tool to study micro and nanostructure, to probe mechanical properties or to investigate dynamic process at biomaterials surfaces and interfaces.

Prior to contact with cells or tissues, biomaterials have to be sterilized. However, many sterilization procedures such as steam autoclave or heat sterilization are known to strongly affect polymer properties. UV irradiation is used as an alternative sterilization method in many tissue engineering laboratories on a routine basis, however, potential alterations of polymer properties have not been extensively considered, In this study we investigated the effects of UV irradiation on spin-cast films made from biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-monomethyl ether diblock copolymers (Me.PEG-PLA) which have recently been developed for controlled cell-biomaterial interaction. After 2 h of UV irradiation, which is sufficient for sterilization, no alterations in cell adhesion to polymer films were detected, as demonstrated with 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This correlated with unchanged film topography and molecular weight distribution. However, extended UV irradiation for 5-24 h elicited drastic responses regarding Me.PEG-PLA polymer properties and interactions with biological elements: Large increases in unspecific protein adsorption and subsequent cell adhesion were observed, Changes in polymer surface properties could be correlated with the observed alterations in cell/protein-polymer interactions. Atomic force microscopy analysis of polymer films revealed a marked ""smoothing"" of the polymer surface after UV irradiation. Investigations using GPC, H-1-NMR, mass spectrometry, and a PEG-specific colorimetric assay demonstrated that polymer film composition was time-dependently affected by exposure to UV irradiation, i.e., that large amounts of PEG were lost from the copolymer surface. The data indicate that sterilization using UV irradiation for 2 h is an appropriate technique for the recently synthesized Me.PEG-PLA diblock copolymers. However, the study also serves as an example that it is indispensable to control the duration of exposure to UV irradiation for a given biomaterial in order not to compromise polymer properties relevant to tissue engineering purposes.

As AFM was used to study the structure of six different polyurethane elastomers, where the reagent stoichiometrics, as well as the chemistry of the hard segments, were changed. The results (especially phase-mode images) indicated that the microdomain structures depend on the hard segment chemistry and are relatively less dependent on the stoichiometry.

During previous hip simulator validation studies, researchers have correlated the mechanical behavior and surface morphology of polymeric biomaterials with the wear performance in a hip simulator. For the present study, we sought correlations between clinical performance and quantitative metrics of the mechanical behavior and surface morphology of retrieved cups. Nine all-UHMWPE acetabular cups of the same cemented design, 32 mm head size, and manufacturer were retrieved after an average implantation time of 14.1 years (range: 11.5-16.4 years). The implants were manufactured from RCH-1000, sterilized by gamma radiation in air and implanted between 1980 and 1983. Mechanical behavior of the retrieved components was determined using the previously validated small punch test, which subjects miniature specimens to multi-axial loading conditions. Surface morphology of the retrievals was assessed using white light interferometry. No significant relationship was observed between the surface roughness measurements and patient related variables. However, statistically significant relationships were observed between the mechanical behavior determined by the small punch test and the implantation time and patient weight associated with the retrieved hip cups. These findings support the hypothesis that the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE is related, at least in part, to the clinical performance of acetabular component bearings for total hip replacement.

The increment of removal should result from the synergistic effect of mechanical and corrosive losses of materials, i.e. the acceleration of corrosion by fretting and the increase of fretting by corrosion. The fretting corrosion behaviors of three biomaterials, 316L stainless steel, Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V alloys were investigated. The total removals of materials should come from five components, pure corrosion, pure wear, corrosion increment caused by fretting, fretting increment caused by corrosion and synergy. Experimental results showed that the dissolution processes of three materials were accelerated significantly by fretting. The approximate removals of materials caused by synergy in saline solution are 31.6% for 316L stainless steel, 15.3% for Co-Cr-Mo alloy and 7.2% for Ti-6Al-4V alloy of total loss, respectively. The corrosion alone was a small percentage, just accounting for about 3% of total loss for three materials. The synergistic process of three materials was discussed based on three important stages, pure fretting, pure corrosion and synergy. The results suggested that both factors of materials and surface contact state should be considered simultaneously for the protection of three biomaterials under fretting corrosion conditions. The possible mechanism responsible for synergy between fretting and corrosion was also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, HCPS has efficiently bound to collagen-coated micro-plates and collagen membranes thereby retaining the binding of heparin-binding growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(165) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Both human skin fibroblast cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells have shown a good adherence to both collagen- and HCPS-bound collagen substrata. The growth rate of the fibroblast cells on the HCPS-bound collagen substratum in the presence of low concentrations of FGF-2 is higher than on a collagen surface. The fibroblast cells grow at a significantly higher rate on the HCPS-bound collagen substratum retained with FGF-2. Similarly, the growth rate of the endothelial cells on the HCPS-bound collagen substrata in the presence of low concentrations of either FGF-2 or VEGF(165) is higher than on collagen. The endothelial cells also grow at a significantly higher rate on the HCPS-bound collagen substratum retained with either FCF-2 or VEGF(165).

However, canines spontaneously re-endothelialize vascular grafts, whereas humans do not, even after years. This raises questions of why there are differences in vascular healing between humans and other species and whether the canine is the appropriate preclinical model. In the present study we evaluated human and canine endothelial cell (EC) migration on the novel cross-linked collagen biomaterial PhotoFix (TM) pericardium. We compared in vitro migration of these cells on PhotoFix alone and on PhotoFix adsorbed with various growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) and adhesion proteins (fibronectin, collagen IV, vitronectin, and laminin). We also compared human and canine ECs in terms of their morphologies and prostacyclin production. We found that human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and canine ECs (CECs) migrated well on PhotoFix, suggesting that this biomaterial may be a good vascular graft candidate. Both cell types responded similarly to different growth factors and adhesive proteins, but HUVEC migration was consistently higher than that for CECs. This suggested that human in vivo graft re-endothelialization is likely not hindered by poor endothelial migration but is hindered by other cellular or graft properties.

The piezoelectric strain tensor element d(14), the elastic constant s(55), and the relative permittivity epsilon (11) were obtained for the collagen and collagen-chitosan films. Resonance measurement of the piezoelectric strain constant d(14) of collagen gives 0.096 pC N-1, which is in good agreement with values reported in the literature, measured using other techniques. It was observed that addition of 15% of chitosan increased the piezoelectricity to 0.212 pC N-1. The frequency constant f L and the piezoelectric strain element d(14), obtained for this sample, present the highest value for the samples under study (427.24 kHz m and 0.212 pC N-1). This value for the d(14) element is of the same order as that obtained for bovine bone (d(14) = 0.2 pC N-1) (T.G. Netto and R.L. Ziemmerman, Biophys..T.,1975,15, 573), which is about one-tenth of the piezoelectric constant d(11) of quartz crystal. Our results also show that the presence of chitosan contributes to an increase in the thermal stability of the collagen films, which is associated with an increase in the denaturation temperature of the collagen-chitosan samples compared with the collagen sample. We believe that the increase in the organization of the microscopic structure of the sample, results in an increase in the piezoelectricity. These high values for the frequency constant and piezoelectricity, give the possibility of using these films in electronic devices based on acoustic waves (e.g. surface acoustic wave devices (SAW)) which operate in the MHz frequency range using piezoelectric substrates.","Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fis, Dept Quim Organ & Inorgan, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fis, Lab Opt Linear & Ciencia Mat, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Engn Mecan, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Ctr Ciencias, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil","Silva, CC (reprint author), Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fis, Dept Quim Organ & Inorgan, Caixa Postal 6030, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",sombra@ufc.br,"UFC, DF/E-1564-2017; Universidade Federal do Ceara, Physics Department/J-4630-2016; Sombra, Antonio/B-2963-2013; Candido Silva, Cleber/I-6434-2012","Universidade Federal do Ceara, Physics Department/0000-0002-9247-6780; Goes, Julio Cesar/0000-0002-6324-7647; Goncalves Pinheiro, Alexandre/0000-0001-5457-6484",,,,15,14,19,1,14,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9076,1463-9084,,PHYS CHEM CHEM PHYS,Phys.

Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering bacteria after 4 h were higher on hydrophilic glass than on hydrophobic silicone rubber, regardless of growth conditions. The presence of 1/4 minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin during growth reduced enterococcal adhesion to both substrata, but growth in the presence of 1/4 MIC vancomycin did not affect the adhesion of E faecalis. Moreover, enterococcal adhesion increased after growth in the presence of 1/8 MIC vancomycin. The increased adhesion after growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin may have strong implications for patients living with implanted biomaterials, as they may suffer adverse effects from use of this antibiotic, especially since bacteria once adhered are less sensitive to antibiotics.

The modified Si(100) surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Surface peroxide concentrations resulting from the argon plasma treatment and subsequent atmospheric exposure were determined by a coupling reaction with diphenylpicrylhydrazyl. The results suggested that a short plasma treatment time of 10 s and brief air exposure were sufficient for generating an optimum amount of peroxides and hydroperoxides for the subsequent W-induced graft polymerization. The graft concentration of the PEGMA polymer increased with increasing PEGMA macromonomer concentration for the graft polymerization and with increasing W graft polymerization time. The PEGMA graft-polymerized silicon surface with a high poly(ethylene glycol) graft concentration was very effective in preventing protein adsorption and platelet adhesion. The grafted PEGMA polymer layer on the Si(100) surface exhibited fairly good stability during storage in a buffer solution.

Patterns were created on the films by application of modified micro fabrication-based phorolithographic techniques. The technique was used to create patterns with depths from 5 to 80 mum. In addition, various polymers were incorporated, including polyethylene glycol methacrylates, styrene, and methacrylic acid, to synthesize regions with different physico-chemical properties.

Although antifouling properties of surface-grafted dextran and PEG are quite similar, surface-bound dextran has multiple reactive sites for high-density surface immobilization of biologically active molecules. We recently reported nontoxic aqueous methods to covalently immobilize dextran on material surfaces. These dextran coatings effectively limited cell adhesion and spreading in the presence of serum-borne cell adhesion proteins. In this study we utilized the same nontoxic aqueous methods to graft cell adhesion peptides on low protein-binding dextran monolayer surfaces. Chemical composition of all modified surfaces was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surface-grafted cell adhesion peptides stimulated endothelial cell, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cell attachment and spreading in vitro. In contrast, surface-grafted inactive peptide sequences did not promote high levels of cell interaction. Surface-grafted high affinity cyclic RGD peptides promoted cell type-dependent interactions. With dextran-based surface coatings, it will be possible to develop well-defined surface modifications that promote specific cell interactions and perhaps better performance in long-term biomaterial implants.

A miniature impactor was designed to produce pellets of aggregates at a standard compactive effort. In Phase 1, 22 sheep underwent implantation of pellets into six metaphyseal defects in both rear limbs. In Phase 2, eight sheep underwent surgical implantation of four pellets in metaphyseal defects, Defects were sealed with polymethylmethacrylate in both phases. Healing of the defects was evaluated at 7 weeks (Phase 1, n = 11) and 14 weeks (M =19) with computed tomography, histology, and histomorphometry. Complications in Phase 1 included four femoral fractures and migration of cement seals (18/102 defects). No complications occurred in Phase 2. Whereas no difference was found between left and right limbs, osteogenesis and incorporation of biomaterials varied among implantation sites. For comparison of grafting materials, treatment site allocations were randomized according to a Latin square design. This model allows evaluation of several impacted aggregates (including large particles) in the same animal. It is particularly suitable for analyzing the biologic properties of grafting materials prior to evaluation under loading conditions.

The life cycle of this alga is complex and is distinguished by its ability to synthesize exquisitely sculptured calcium carbonate cell coverings known as coccoliths. These structures have been targeted by materials scientists for applications relating to the chemistry of biomedical materials, robust membranes for high-temperature separation technology, lightweight ceramics, and semiconductor design. To date, however, the molecular and biochemical events controlling coccolith production have not been determined. In addition, little is known about the life cycle of E. huxleyi and the environmental and physiological signals triggering phase switching between the diploid and haploid life cycle stages. We have developed laboratory methods for inducing phase variation between the haploid (S-cell) and diploid (C-cell) life cycle stages of E. huxleyi. Plating E. huxleyi C cells on solid media was shown to induce phase switching from the C-cell to the S-cell life cycle stage, the latter of which has been maintained for over 2 years under these conditions. Pure cultures of S cells were obtained for the first time. Laboratory conditions for inducing phase switching from the haploid stage to the diploid stage were also established. Regeneration of the C-cell stage from pure cultures of S cells followed a predictable pattern involving formation of large aggregations of S cells and the subsequent production of cultures consisting predominantly of diploid C cells. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate the life cycle of E. huxleyi under controlled laboratory conditions, providing us with powerful tools for the development of genetic techniques for analysis of coccolithogenesis and for investigating the complex life cycle of this important marine alga.","Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol Sci, San Marcos, CA 92096 USA","Wahlund, TM (reprint author), Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol Sci, 333 S Twin Oaks Valley Rd, San Marcos, CA 92096 USA.",twahlund@mailhost1.csusm.edu,,,,,,38,11,15,1,13,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

The Omnicarbon and Omniscience valves are identical in form but differ in that the Omnicarbon valve is constructed entirely of pyrolytic carbon, whereas the Omniscience valve uses titanium for its housing, the rest of its structure being pyrolytic carbon. The literature was reviewed and a comparison in similar groups of patients was made between these two model valves for their thromboembolic rates in the mitral and aortic positions. A total of 569 aortic Omnicarbon valves (4,146 patient years [pt yrs.]) had a thromboembolic events (T/E rate) of 0.5% compared with 1.7% for 468 aortic Omniscience (1,552 pt yrs); p < 0.0001.

We selected polylysine (PLL) and poly(glutamic acid) (PGA) for the polyelectrolytes and murine melanoma cells as a biological test model system. These cells respond specifically to a small peptide hormone, alpha-melanocortin, which is a potent stimulator of melanogenesis. We show that a synthetic alpha-melanocortin derivative, covalently coupled to PLL forming the outer layer of a multilayer film remains as biologically active as the free hormone. Furthermore, the long time activity of the hormone is maintained when embedded in multilayer architectures whereas its short time activity depends on integration depth.

Several groups of biomaterials have been proposed as support for in vitro cell growth and for in vivo implantation. Here, we describe a new approach investigating the healing of rabbit cartilage by means of autologous chondrocytes seeded on a hyaluronan derivative referred to as Hyaff(R)-11. Full thickness defects were created bilaterally in the weight-bearing Surface of the medial femoral condyle of both femora of New Zealand male rabbits. The wounds were then repaired using both chondrocytes seeded on the biomaterial and biomaterial alone. Controls were similarly treated but received either no treatment or implants of the delivery substance. Histologic samples from in and around the defect sites were examined 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery and were scored from 0 to 16. Statistically significant differences in the quality of the regenerated tissue were found between the grafts carried out with biomaterial carrying chondrocyte cells compared to the biomaterial alone or controls. This study demonstrates the efficacy of this hyaluronan-based scaffold for autologous chondrocytes transplantation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This contact between blood and the biomaterials of implants and extracorporeal circuits leads to an inflammatory response mediated by the complement system. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a complement regulator (factor H) immobilised on a biomaterial surface to inhibit complement cascade mediated inflammatory responses. The cross-linker-N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate was used to immobilise factor H on a model biomaterial surface without affecting the biological activity of the inhibitor. Binding of factor H was then characterised using quartz crystal micro balance-dissipation (QCM-D) and enzyme immunoassays for products of complement activation: bound C3 fragments and soluble C3a, sC5b-9, and C1s-C1INA. Immobilised factor H reduced the amount C3 fragments deposited on the biomaterial surface after incubation with serum, plasma, or whole blood. In addition, lower levels of soluble C3a, and sC5b-9 were generated after incubation with whole blood. In summary, we have demonstrated that complement activation on a highly activating model surface can be inhibited by immobilised factor H and have defined prerequisites for the preparation of future biomaterial surfaces with immobilised regulators of complement activation.

For these reasons, it has been used for the fabrication of temporary stents, bone plates, nails and screws (Peng et al. Biomaterials 1996;17:685). In some cases, the brittle mechanical properties of PHB homopolymer limit its application. A typical plasticizer, triethylcitrate (TEC), was used to overcome such limitations by making the material more pliable, In the past few years, CO2-laser cutting of PHB was used in the manufacturing of small medical devices such as stents. Embrittlement of plasticized PHB tubes has been observed, after laser machining. Consequently, the physicochemical and morphological properties of laser-processed surfaces and cut edges of plasticized polymer samples were examined to determine the extent of changes in polymer properties as a result of laser machining. These studies included determination of the depth of the laser-induced heat affected zone by polariscopy of thin polymer sections. Molecular weight changes and changes in the TEC content as a function of distance from the laser-cut edge were determined. In a preliminary test, the cellular response to the processed material was investigated by cell culture study of L929 mouse fibroblasts on laser-machined surfaces. The heat-affected zone was readily classified into four different regions with a total depth of about 60 to 100 mum (Klamp, Master Thesis, University of Rostock, 1998). These results correspond well with the chemical analysis and molecular weight measurements. Furthermore, it was found that cells grew preferentially on the laser-machined area. These findings have significant implications for the manufacture of medical implants from PHB by laser machining. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The time courses of piezoelectric parameters were used to reflect the changes of interfacial physical properties, such as mass, density-viscosity, and dielectric constant, during the adsorptions of peptide and fullerols onto electrode. The electrochemical impedance based on the simple equivalent electric network were also simultaneously measured and provided electrochemical interface information, e.g., double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance. It was found that the double-impedance responses were varied with the forms of glutathione. It was also shown that the frequency curves due to the adsorption of oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione could be exhibited as different kinetic equations. The heterogeneous charge-transfer rate constants of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide before and after the peptide and fullerols adsorption were determined by CV and EIS methods. The results showed that the proposed method has potential applications in interfacial studies of biomaterials, since these combined techniques have advantages in real time providing multidimensional piezoelectric and electrochemical impedance information.

RKKP is a glass well known for its bioactivity; therefore, a RKKP coating on Al2O3 or ZrO2, allows to combine the excellent mechanical properties of these strong ceramic substrates with its bioactivity. ZrO2 samples were easily coated using a double layer of RKKP by a simple enamelling technique. To accommodate the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Al2O3 and RKKP, this substrate was coated using a multilayered composite approach. All of the coatings were characterised from a morphological and compositional point of view, and an extensive biological evaluation was performed using fresh rat osteoblasts. Osteoblast primary Cultures were derived from the trabecular bone of femoral condyles harvested from intact (NB) and osteopenic (OB) rats. After characterisation of their phenotype, osteoblasts were seeded on material samples of ZrO2 or Al2O3 coated with RKKP, and cultured for 7 days. Cell proliferation (MTT test) and cell differentiation (alkaline phosphatase activity) were evaluated at the end of the experiment, to assess osteoblast behaviour in the presence of biomaterials and determine if the results were related to the host bone quality. Results of both materials showed a good level of biocompatibility. In particular, MTT significant higher values were detected in NB cultures on ZrO2-RKKP samples; ALP activity significantly increased in NB cultures on Al2O3-RKKP and in OB cultures on both coated samples.

The aim of this study was to examine the adsorption of proteins onto specimens of different ceramic materials after the incubation in saliva and plasma before and after in vitro corrosion. In addition, the topography of the biofilm was examined by AFM. Surface-bound proteins were desorbed and analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting using antibodies to saliva and plasma proteins. Silver-stained gels indicated differences in the adsorption of proteins. Differences in surface roughness at the nanometer level did not, however, seem to be correlated to the protein adsorption. After corrosion, unchanged or increased protein staining was generally seen in the gels and Western blots. The reactions for salivary amylase and proline-rich proteins varied between the different materials. Albumin and fibrinogen were identified in samples from all materials tested.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing integrated microsystems for biological and biomedical processing and analysis. We report development of selective surface modification techniques based on microcontact printing and polyelectrolyte adsorption. These techniques were applied to lithographically patterned silicon microfluidic channels and flat silicon substrates to create surface microstructures with contrasting wetting properties and surface charges. These controls enabled us to devise various techniques for controlled loading and processing of biomaterials in the channels. Solutions containing long chain biological macromolecules DNA and microtubules were directly loaded into the microchannels by using a micromanipulator/microinjector system. Structural arrangements of these linear macromolecules, which were probed by using fluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy, were found to be quite different from bulk solutions. As expected, the filamentous molecules were observed to align linearly along the channels, with the degree of alignment dependent on channel width as well as the length of the molecule. This molecular alignment, which is induced by both the surface confinement effect and capillary flow during sample loading, may be used to enhance processing of biological materials in silicon biomedical microdevices. It also opens up the possibility of carrying out direct combinatorial structural characterization of proteins in the microchannels utilizing X-ray diffraction, which so far has not been possible.","[Li, Youli; Pfohl, Thomas; Kim, Joon Heon; Yassa, Mario; Kim, Mahn Won; Safinya, Cyrus R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Dept Phys, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Li, Youli; Pfohl, Thomas; Kim, Joon Heon; Yassa, Mario; Kim, Mahn Won; Safinya, Cyrus R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Biochem & Mol Biol Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Wen, Zhiyu] Chongqing Univ, Coll Optoelect Engn, Chongqing 630044, Peoples R China; [Kim, Joon Heon; Kim, Mahn Won] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Li, YL (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Dept Phys, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",youli@mrl.ucsb.edu,"Pfohl, Thomas/D-7296-2016","Pfohl, Thomas/0000-0002-7879-5216",NIH [GM59288]; University of California Biotech Research and Education training [99-14]; DFG [pf 375/1-1]; Chongqing University through the Ministry of Education of China; KISTEP [99-I-01-03-A-064];  [NSF-DMR-9972246];  [NSF-DMR-0076357];  [ONR-N00014-00-1-0214];  [NSF-DMR-0080034],"This work was supported by NSF-DMR-9972246, NSF-DMR-0076357, ONR-N00014-00-1-0214, NIH Grant GM59288, and the University of California Biotech Research and Education training grant 99-14.

Nearly all of these investigations have utilized the sugar trehalose as a stabilizing molecule. Over the past two decades a myth has grown up about special properties of trehalose for stabilization of biomaterials. We review many of such uses here and show that under ideal conditions for drying and storage trehalose has few, if any, properties. However, under suboptimal conditions trehalose has some distinct advantages and thus may remain the preferred excipient. We review the available mechanisms for introducing trehalose into the cytoplasm of living cells as an introduction to the papers that follow.

Design: Animal study. Setting: Faculty of Medicine, University of Alcala, Spain. Animals: 14 white New Zealand white rabbits divided into 2 groups of 7 each. Interventions: Defects (7 x 5 cm) involving all the layers of the abdominal wall were created and repaired using Parietex Composite (R) or Vypro (R) prostheses. Fourteen days after implantation, prosthetic specimens were examined by microscopy, and morphometric and biomechanical analysis. Main outcome measures: Infection, healing, development of adhesions, and histological appearance of the interface. Results: Firm adhesions were detected after the implant of Vypro while adhesion were loose in the Parietex group. The mean (SD) prosthetic surface area covered by adhesions was significantly greater in the Vypro group 22.3 (2.8) compared with 0.2 (0.02), p < 0.01). The neoperitoneum formed after the implant of Parietex was well-organised and homogeneous and covered by a typical mesothelium, while in the Vypro it was disorganised, with a rough texture composed of prosthetic filaments and nodes. The neoperitonum was thicker in the Parietex group 154.0 (5.4) compared with 50.8 (2.3), p < 0.05) while higher biomechanical resistance values were recorded in the Vypro group 30.4 (1.9) compared with 15.0 (2.73), p < 0.05). Conclusions: While both biomaterials integrated well with tissue, Parietex behaved better at the peritoneal interface.","Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Surg Res Lab, ES-28871 Madrid, Spain","Bellon, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Surg Res Lab, Crta Madrid Barcelona,Km 33-6, ES-28871 Madrid, Spain.",,,"Garcia Honduvilla, Natalio/0000-0003-0904-6198; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,16,2,5,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"CORT ADELERSGT 17, PO BOX 2562, SOLLI, 0202 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Such drug delivery systems differ from conventional drug dosage forms (pills, tablets, ointments, creams, injectables and 'tiny time capsules') in that a localised depot of drug provides patterned release of the active agent with a predetermined time course. The pattern of drug release may be constant, oscillating, declining continuously, or even pulsatile. The need to engineer different release patterns for drugs of different molecular sizes, potency, stability and hydrophobicity provides the impetus for active study of the design of new biomaterials, intelligent delivery systems and approaches for delivery through different portals in the body. The field of controlled drug delivery provides a driving force for current innovations in biomaterials. For most drug delivery systems, polymers function simply as inert, biocompatible carriers. In other systems, polymers can be designed with targeting or pathology-responsive functions. This review summarises some of the recently developed intellectual property in the field of biomaterials applied to drug delivery systems. Included are implantable ceramics and other inorganic materials, nondegradable and degradable synthetic polymers, natural polymers and hybrid biomaterials derived from synthetic and natural polymers.","Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Prestwich, GD (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, 30 South 2000 East,Room 201, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",gprestwich@deans.pharm.utah.edu,,,,,,129,23,23,5,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-3776,1744-7674,,EXPERT OPIN THER PAT,Expert Opin.

The screws were tested biomechanically (extraction torque) and histomorphometrically (affinity index: Al) 12 weeks after their implantation in tibia! diaphyses. Tibial cortical bone parameters showed significant differences between the groups, showing a reduction of the selected parameters in the OVX group. ANOVA showed significant effects for both material and ovariectomy factors on obtained extraction torque (material: F=159.26, p < 0.0005; ovariectomy: F=20.04, p < 0.0005) and AI data (material: F=8.04, p < 0.001; ovariectomy: F=7.17, p < 0.05). In both groups the extraction torque for coated screws of both materials was significantly higher than for uncoated screws, and uncoated titanium had a better extraction torque than uncoated stainless steel. In the OVX group, the HA-coated stainless steel and titanium AI data were significantly higher than uncoated Al data. In conclusion, the biomechanical and histomorphological results obtained suggest employing HA-coated screws in the presence of osteopenic cortical bone.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Codivilla Putti Res Inst, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Sch Med, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Rocca, M (reprint author), IOR, Serv Chirurg Sperimentale, Ist Ric Codivilla Putti, Via di Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,36,27,28,0,2,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Setting. Research Department, Allergan Inc., Irvine, California, USA. Methods. Intraocular lens (IOL) optic materials were implanted intramuscularly and/or subcutaneously in rabbits for up to 90 days. The materials included silicone, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogel, and several hydrophobic acrylic materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to detect calcification demonstrated by characteristic discrete nodules containing both calcium and phosphate. Histological methods were used to evaluate tissue reactivity. Disc lenses fabricated from the experimental material were also bilaterally implanted in rabbit eyes that were monitored by slitlamp biomicroscopy. The lenses were explanted at 1, 2, 5.5, 10, and 20 months for SEM/EDS analysis. Results: No calcification was noted in the intramuscularly or subcutaneously implanted silicone, PMMA, and acrylic optic materials. Calcification was noted on the intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intraocularly implanted experimental acrylic and the intramuscularly implanted hydrogel material; the calcification was more extensive on the hydrogel, Signs that suggested intraocular calcification were first noted on the experimental IOLs at 4 months, but calcification was not confirmed until 10 months. Conclusions: Material calcification occurred more quickly in an intramuscular or subcutaneous environment than in an intraocular environment. Intramuscular and subcutaneous implantation appears to be an excellent model for screening materials for calcification potential. However, calcification is both host environment and material dependent. Using intramuscular or subcutaneous implantation in animal models to predict intraocular calcification in humans must be done with caution.","Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Irvine, CA 92623 USA","Buchen, SY (reprint author), Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, 2525 Dupont Dr,POB 19534, Irvine, CA 92623 USA.",,,,,,,16,23,24,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

This study was aimed at investigation reaction between the potential implant materials and surround tissue. Cytotoxicity of human and rat osteoblast in the material extracts was determinated by testing standards such as GHS assay, MIT assay, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, LDH assay, and Lowry assay. Research results demonstrated that compared with the control condition polystyrene culture plate both human and rat osteoblast cells have normal phenotypic expression in hydroxyapatite extract, and this expression was statistically restricted in hydroxyapatite-spinel extract. However, this restrict, e. g. cytotoxicity could be partially eliminated by immersion treatment of the materials in culture medium.","Cent S Univ, State Key Lab Powder Met, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; Univ Strathclyde, Bioengn Unit, Glasgow G4 0NW, Lanark, Scotland","Ruan, JM (reprint author), Cent S Univ, State Key Lab Powder Met, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,16,3,4,0,2,JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIV TECHNOLOGY,HUNAN,"EDITORIAL OFFICE, CHANGSHA, HUNAN 410083, PEOPLES R CHINA",1005-9784,,,J CENT SOUTH UNIV T,J.

Most manifestations of candidiasis are associated with biofilm formation, with cells in biofilms displaying properties dramatically different from free-living cells grown under normal laboratory conditions. Here, we report on the development of in vitro models of C. dabliniensis biofilms on the surfaces of biomaterials (polystyrene and acrylic) and on the characteristics associated with biofilm formation by this newly described species. Time course analysis using a formazan salt reduction assay to monitor metabolic activities of cells within the biofilm, together with microscopy studies, revealed that biofilm formation by C. dubliniensis occurred after initial focal adherence, followed by growth, proliferation, and maturation over 24 to 48 h. Serum and saliva preconditioning films enhanced the initial attachment of C. dubliniensis and subsequent biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to further characterize C. dubliniensis biofilms. Mature C. dubliniensis biofilms consisted of a dense network of yeasts cells and hyphal elements embedded within exopolymeric material. C. dubliniensis biofilms displayed spatial heterogeneity and an architecture showing microcolonies with ramifying water channels. Antifungal susceptibility testing demonstrated the increased resistance of sessile C. dubliniensis cells, including the type strain and eight different clinical isolates, against fluconazole and amphotericin B compared to their planktonic counterparts. C. dubliniensis biofilm formation may allow this species to maintain its ecological niche as a commensal and during infection with important clinical repercussions.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, S Texas Ctr Biol Med, Dept Med,Div Infect Dis, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA","Lopez-Ribot, JL (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, S Texas Ctr Biol Med, Dept Med,Div Infect Dis, Texas Res Pk,15355 Lambda Dr, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA.",,"Lopez-Ribot, Jose/D-2048-2010",,,,,65,108,114,0,7,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0095-1137,,,J CLIN MICROBIOL,J.

The properties of the collagen substrate can be manipulated, for example, by crosslinking, to optimize desirable properties such as cell growth and penetration into the substrate, biological stability and mechanical strength. Collagen sponges crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) and the diamine, diaminohexane, were used to determine the effect of crosslinking on pore size and morphology, on the stability of the crosslinked sponges both in cell culture media and during incubation with collagenase, and on the penetration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts through the sponge matrix. Crosslinking of the sponges reduced the pore size, particularly at the surface, and altered sponge morphology. After crosslinking the collagen fibers were thinner, and appeared lacy and delicate. Crosslinking also influenced sponge stability. In keratinocyte serum-free medium the pore size of plain collagen sponges increased with increasing incubation time, and crosslinking appeared to prevent this, and may have stabilized sponge structure. Incubation in serum-containing Dulbecco's minimum essential medium caused a marked reduction in pore size in both plain collagen and crosslinked collagen sponges. Crosslinking did not appear to influence this cell-free contraction of collagen sponges. Treatment of sponges with EDAC markedly increased the resistance of sponges to collagenase digestion. The penetration of both keratinocytes and fibroblasts was retarded by crosslinking the sponges. Fibroblasts penetrated through the sponges to a greater extent than keratinocytes, and their proliferation rate was faster. The total number of cells populating the crosslinked sponges after 10 days culture was approximately 50% of that on untreated collagen sponges. The mechanism responsible for this effect was different with the two crosslinkers used. Diaminohexane appeared to inhibit cell growth, whereas EDAC may have caused a decrease in cell adhesion to the sponges, without an apparent inhibition of growth rate. In terms of morphology, fibroblasts were elongated to a greater extent on crosslinked sponges, and alligned themselves along the collagen fibers. Keratinocytes grew in colonies on untreated sponges, but on crosslinked sponges they grew in isolation, with minimal cell-cell interactions. It may be necessary to reach a compromise to obtain the best combination of properties for using collagen sponges as substrata for artificial skin substitutes.

At low concentrations (12.5-50 mug/ml), nanospheres with diameters varying from 7 to 53 nm were identified while at concentrations ranging between 100-300 mug/ml the size distribution was significantly narrowed to be steadily between 10 and 25 nm in diameter. These nanospheres were observed to be the basic building blocks of both engineered rM179 gels and of the developing enamel extracellular matrix. The stable 15-20-nm nanosphere structures generated in the presence of high concentrations of amelogenins were postulated to be of great importance in facilitating the highly organized ultrastructural microenvironment required for the formation of initial enamel apatite crystallites.

We studied the influence of the nature of the oligomeric modifier, initially miscible with DCBA, on the chemical structure, glass transition behaviour, phase morphology and mechanical properties of modified PCN. The possibility of PEth incorporation into the PCN structure through mixed cyanurate ring formation is discussed. A maximum PEth incorporated content of 0.1 mol of PEth per mol of DCBA irrespective of PEth type has been detected. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) analysis showed the formation of multiphase polymer compositions due to microphase separation of the components occurring during DCBA/PPG curing. The formation of very finely divided morphologies with highly interpenetrated phases, i.e. a PCN-rich phase, a mixed phase of PCN/PPG components and a PPG-rich phase was determined. On the other hand, all PCN/PTMG cured compositions exhibited a single, broad glass transition that shifted to lower temperature as the modifier content was increased and the experimental T-g versus modifier content showed a slight positive deviation from the Fox equation fur miscible polymer systems. It can be concluded that the PCN and the PTMG have a higher degree of compatibility than PCN and PPG. The introduction of small additions of modifier (< 10 wt%) allow production of the thermosets with high T-g and good strength properties. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, laparoscopy for acceptable forms of urinary diversion is time consuming and costly. A neobladder ""off the shelf"" would be a better solution. Tissue engineering is an exciting new field which enables the cultivation and expansion of individual bladder cells obtained by transurethral biopsy, the attachment of these cells to a support matrix, and their reimplantation into the body. Advances both in biomaterials as well as in the cultivation and expansion of bladder cells are described. Promising routine clinical applications of tissue engineering may still need several years. Free neurovascular muscle transfer to the bladder demonstrated both experimentally and clinically to be a suitable treatment modality in patients with bladder acontractility. This may therefore be the next logical step towards an improved bladder substitute by combining well vascularized flaps with urothelial cell seeding.

Perfusion of blood on the polymeric substrates was performed after treatments either with or without preadsorption of 1% blood plasma, and either with or without residence of the protein-preadsorbed substrate in phosphate buffered solution. The surfaces employed were elastic polymers such as poly(ether urethane urea), poly(ether urethane), silicone urethane copolymer, silicone rubber and poly(ether urethane) with the anti-calcifying agent hydroxyethane. bisphosphate. Each polymer surface treated was exposed in vitro to the dynamic, heparinized whole blood perfused for upto 6 min and the surface area of platelets initially adhered was measured by employing in situ epifluorescence video microscopy. The blood perfusion was performed on the surfaces treated at the following three different conditions: directly on the bare surfaces, after protein pre-adsorption and after residence in buffer for 3 days of the surfaces protein pre-adsorbed for 2 h. The effects of blood plasma pre-adsorption on the initial platelet adhesion was surface-dependent. The amount of the adsorbed fibrinogen and the surface coverage area of the adhered platelets were dependent on the surface conditions whether substrates were bare surfaces or protein pre-adsorbed ones. To test an effect of possible morphological (re) orientations of the adsorbed proteins on the initial platelet adhesion, the polymeric substrate pre-adsorbed with 1% blood plasma was immersed in phosphate buffered solution for 3 days and then exposed to physiological blood perfusion. The surface area of the platelets adhered on these surfaces was significantly different from that of the surfaces treated with protein pre-adsorption only. These results indicated that platelet adhesion was dependent on the surface property itself and pre-treatment conditions such as blood perfusion without any pre-adsorption of proteins, and blood perfusion either after protein pre-adsorption or after subsequent substrate residence in buffer of the substrate pre-adsorbed with proteins. Understanding of these results may guide for better designs of blood-contacting materials based on protein behaviors.","Seoul Natl Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Nowon Gu, Seoul 139743, South Korea",,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,2,POLYMER SOC KOREA,SEOUL,"ROOM 601, HATCHON BUILDING, 831 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-792, SOUTH KOREA",1225-5947,,,KOREA POLYM J,Korea Polym.

Critical analysis of solution thermodynamics is made in order to scrutinize trehalose properties often called 'anomalous' and to check the consistency of literature results. Discussion on the conversion between the solid state polymorphic forms is given, with a special emphasis of the transformations involving the newly identified anhydrous crystalline form of alpha,alpha -trehalose, TREalpha. This exotic crystal is almost 'isomorphous' with the dihydrate crystal structure, and possesses the unique feature of reversibly absorbing water to produce the dihydrate, without changing the main structural features. The reversible process could play a functional role in the well-known ability of this sugar to protect biological structures from damage during desiccation. The final aim of the paper is to add some new insights into and to reconcile previous hypotheses for the peculiar 'in vivo' action of trehalose. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

From the observation of the symmetric and antisymmetric stretch vibrations of the glycosidic linkage, it is found that this sugar assumes at least three types of backbone conformations. Among them, the conformation with C-2 symmetry is characterized as 'open state', which means that the sugar easily absorbs water molecules. The conformation of the sugars in anhydrous form II and in freeze-dried trehalose is shown to be in the open state. Next, the hygroscopic properties of the anhydrate, form II and the amorphous solid are compared based on their IR spectra. Interestingly, form II alone is converted to the original dihydrate in a week under mild environmental-like conditions: relative humidity of 40% and room temperature. These results suggest the possibility that form II plays a role in avoiding the devitrification of the sugar glass. Finally, we discuss the role of form II in preserving freeze-dried biomaterials.

In this sensor, an array of microholes is etched through a silicon membrane. On the sidewalls of these microholes, a working electrode is formed by platinum sputtering. On the top of the microholes, a membrane of glucose oxidase (GOD) is deposited. Owing to the separation of the working electrode and the enzyme membrane, standard MEMS processes can be carried out as the front-end processes during the fabrication. The enzyme membrane will be deposited as the last process step. This avoids the problem of incompatibility between MEMS processes and biomaterials. In this way, the glucose sensor can be easily integrated in the microchannel. The diffusion of hydrogen peroxide in the microholes was simulated with different ratios of depth and diameter. It is shown that when the ratio of diameter and depth of the microholes is 1, most of the produced hydrogen peroxide can be oxidized at the working electrode on the sidewalls of microholes. Laser drilling and magnetron RIE were exploited, respectively, to fabricate the array of microholes. The responses of both the stand-alone sensor and the sensor integrated in the microchannel are shown. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The surfactant polymers are comblike polymers consisting of a poly(vinylamine) backbone with 2 kDa PEO and hexanal side chains. The polymers were prepared with various grafting ratios of the two side chains. Surface pressure isotherms were obtained for spread monolayers for the range of polymer compositions. Two transitions are observed at 5 and 11 mN/m, which are interpreted as stages of desorption for the PEO side chains from the interface into the aqueous subphase. It is demonstrated that it is possible to scale the isotherms quantitatively to provide an accurate determination of the side chain composition. We characterized the adsorption process of two of the surfactant polymers at the water-graphite interface, using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). With high hexanal:PEO content (e.g., 8:1), the surfactant polymer rapidly forms a compact and complete monolayer 1.2 nm thick. At lower hexanal:PEO content (e.g., 4:1), a disordered layer is formed. After several hours, this layer rearranges into small scattered domains with banded structures.

With regard to the inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants, it was previously found that a crucial precedent event was the spontaneous adsorption and denaturation of fibrinogen on implant surfaces. It was further found that interactions between the phagocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and one short sequence within the fibrinogen D domain (gamma 190-202; P1) at least partially explained phagocyte accumulation on implant surfaces. However, the reason that adsorbed fibrinogen is proinflammatory-while soluble fibrinogen clearly is not-remained obscure. In this study, therefore, the question of how fibrinogen is converted to a proinflammatory state when adsorbed to biomaterial surfaces is investigated. In soluble fibrinogen, the 13 amino acid P1 sequence was found to be hidden. However, the adsorption and denaturation of fibrinogen on the surfaces of commonly used biomaterials lead to the exposure of P1 and a second neo-epitope, gamma 377-395 (P2), which also interacts with Mac-1 and is similarly occult in the soluble protein. The extent of biomaterial-mediated PI and P2 exposure appears directly related to the severity of inflammatory responses to a test panel of biomaterials. Finally, thrombin-mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin also exposes both P1 and P2 epitopes. These observations may help explain both the inflammation caused by many types of implanted biomaterials and that which occurs naturally following thrombotic events.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tang, LP (reprint author), Univ Texas, Biomed Engn Program, Box 19138, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R01-HL56187, R01-HL60787, R01-HL63199]",,,73,252,254,3,62,AMER SOC HEMATOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1900 M STREET.

The aim was to increase surface hydrophilicity and improve blood compatibility. Therefore, the prepared membranes were modified by treatment with oxygen or argon plasmas. Characterizations of the samples were achieved by contact-angle and water-uptake studies as well as from atomic force microscope (AFM) pictures. It was found that oxygen-modified samples were more hydrophilic than argon-modified samples. The AFM images showed that surface roughness increased with plasma treatment. The protein adsorption experiments carried out with single protein solutions demonstrated that the adsorption of bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen decreased drastically by increasing the applied power and exposure time of the glow discharge. A similar decrease in the adsorption of protein was also observed for human blood proteins. The alterations of the conformational structures of the adsorbed proteins were examined by fluorescence spectrophotometry. Similar spectra with the same maximum wavelength were observed for native and desorbed proteins. These results showed that no denaturation of the proteins occurred upon adsorption on the surfaces of the prepared membranes.

The present study considers this problem when the truss is made of a material with random microstructure, that is, when co is a random field. The trusses tending to the optimal state can be determined through a net of characteristics generalized to a stochastic setting. While in the classical case of a homogeneous material this net gives the minimum weight as its spacing tends to zero, the presence of a random microstructure prevents the attainment of this state. Basically, the finer the net, the stronger the scatter of characteristics, which forces one to use more structural material to compensate for these fluctuations. In effect, there is a limitation to the attainment of the optimality of the Michell truss made of a hypothetical perfectly homogeneous material.","Inst Paper Sci & Technol, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA","Ostoja-Starzewski, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",martin.ostoja@ipst.edu,,"Ostoja-Starzewski, Martin/0000-0002-3493-363X",,,,15,3,3,0,0,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-5021,1471-2946,,P ROY SOC A-MATH PHY,Proc.

Tissue engineering approaches can be categorized into substitutive approaches, where the aim is the ex vivo construction of a living tissue or organ similar to a transplant, vs. histioconductive or histioinductive concepts in vivo. The main successful approaches in developing tissue substitutes to date have been progresses in the understanding of cell-cell interactions, the selection of appropriate matrices (cell-matrix interaction) and chemical signalling (cytokines, growth factors) for stimulation of cell proliferation and migration within a tissue-engineered construct. So far virtually all mammalian cells can be cultured under specific culture conditions and in tissue specific matrices. Future progress in cell biology may permit the use of pluripotent stem cells for TE. The blueprint for tissue differentiation is the genome: for this it is reasonable to combine tissue engineering with gene therapy. The key to the progress of tissue engineering is an understanding between basic scientists, biochemical engineers, clinicians, and industry. Anat Rec 263:372-378, 2001.

Prior to the fractography study, we assessed degradation through FTIR and optical density measurements in microtome sections. Then, we morphologically compared the surface fractography of degraded, oxidized UHMWPE with that of non-degraded material in specimens from the same implants, fractured after uniaxial tensile tests in standardized samples. Fractography surface analysis clearly differentiated the behavior of non-degraded and degraded UHMWPE. Failure in non-degraded samples occurred through craze formation, followed by fast crack propagation. Quantitative fracture analysis suggested a ductile behavior. This was supported by the identified local plasticity in the region close to the initial flaw. In the fractography surface analysis of degraded material, a fibrillar behavior was observed. A heterogeneous domain structure appeared, showing different coarseness with multiple void sizes. Our results, based on mechanical measurements and fracture morphology in the subsurface region, confirmed the embrittlement of oxidized UHMWPE. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This approach involves ozonation and then followed by graft polymerization with acrylates containing PEG, sulfonated PEG or by coupling of PEG derivatives. All the reactions were confirmed by ATR FT-IR and ESCA. The degree of ozonation measured by the iodide method was dependent on the ozone permeability of the polymers used. Surface hydrophilicity was investigated by measuring the contact angles. Ozonation itself yielded a slight increase in hydrophilicity and a decrease in platelet adhesion, but PEG immobilization showed a significant effect on surface hydrophilicity and platelet adhesion to confirm well-known PEG's passivity which minimize the adhesion of blood components on polymer surfaces. Both graft polymerization and coupling were effective for PU. In contrast, only grafting gave enough yields for PMMA and silicone. Platelet adhesion results demonstrated that all PEG modified surfaces adsorbed lower platelet adhesion than untreated or ozonated ones. Polymers coupled with sulfonated PEG exhibited the lowest platelet adhesion when compared with control and PEG coupled ones by virtue of the synergistic effect of non-adhesive PEG and negatively charged SO3 groups. This PEG or sulfonated PEG immobilization technology using ozonation is relatively simple for introducing uniform surface modification and therefore very useful for practical application of blood contacting medical devices.

The available implants have different structural characteristics, which may influence orbital response. We studied the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts in vitro after exposure to four different orbital implants. Methods: Four orbital implant biomaterials were studied: hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye), synthetic hydroxyapatite, porous polyethylene (Medpor) (pore sizes 150 mum and 400 mum) and aluminium oxide (Bioceramic implant). Human fibroblasts obtained from orbital fat at the time of elective blepharoplasty were cultured and then exposed to the individual implants. Cell growth was assessed with immunocytochemical analysis using bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue. After DNA denaturation, the cells were washed, incubated with secondary antibody and visualized. Results: The fibroblasts growing on the Bio-Eye, synthetic hydroxyapatite, and 150-mum and 400-mum Medpor implants all had debris associated with them. The Bioceramic implant was free of this debris. The Bioceramic implant and the 150-mum Medpor implant had the greatest number of fibroblasts on the coverslips. Interpretation: The proliferation of fibroblasts, as determined by visualization of actively dividing cells with bromodeoxyuridine, differed on the various implants studied. The lack of debris associated with the Bioceramic implant may be related to the crystalline structure of the implant.","Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Univ Ottawa, Inst Eye, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Mawn, LA (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Med Ctr, 2115 21st Ave S,8000 Med Ctr E, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",louise.mawn@mcmail.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,33,21,23,0,2,CANADIAN OPHTHAL SOC,OTTAWA,"1525 CARLING AVE SUITE 610, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 8R9, CANADA",0008-4182,1715-3360,,CAN J OPHTHALMOL,Can.

Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of application of chitin beads (a bioabsorbable natural polymer) as a bone substitute in bone formation by GTR. The experiment was carried out in 25 rats. The mandibular ramus was exposed on one side after elevation of a muscle-periosteal flap, and a teflon capsule filled with chitin beads (2.0 mm in diameter) was placed with its opening facing the lateral aspect of the ramus. On the contralateral side of the jaw, serving as control, an empty teflon capsule was placed in the same manner. Groups of 5 animals were sacrificed at 7, 15, 30, 60 and 120 days following capsule placement. Histological analysis demonstrated that the amount of newly formed bone was similar in both experimental and control specimens, amounting to approximately 3% of the central/largest, cross-sectional area created by the capsule at 15 days, and to approximately 9% of this area at 30 days following capsule placement. At 60 and 120 days, however, the amount of newly formed bone observed in the control specimens was twice as large as that observed in the test specimens, amounting to approximately 31% of the cross-sectional area created by the capsule at 60 days, and to approximately 45% at 120 days.

The hemocompatibility of the coating compared favorably with that of low temperature isotropic (LTI) carbon, with kinetic clotting time and hemolysis rate approximately the same as for LTI carbon, and platelet consumption about twice that of the latter. The mechanical properties were good, with a microhardness greater than that of the uncoated metal substrates, and high adhesion of >0.75 GPa (interface shear stress) as estimated from a thermal quench method. Glancing-angle X-ray diffraction measurements indicated the presence of a TiC transition layer, suggesting the formation of a Ti/TiC/ta-C multilayer structure, leading in turn to good film-substrate adhesion. We conclude that this kind of amorphous diamond coating could provide benefit as a biocompatible hard coating for Ti-6Al-4V substrate material. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is especially needed to study damage process of the particles at slight movement and lower load for long-term service of implanted materials. The wear and abrasion behavior of particles on Ti-6Al-4V coated with diamond-like carbon (DLC) were appropriately simulated in the present paper by fretting wear and nano-scratch test. The coatings with a thickness of 2.5 mum were deposited with an r.f.-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. The analytic techniques employed to assess DLC coatings characterization include SEM, ATM, Raman and IR spectroscopy. Assessment of hardness, elastic modulus, abrasion and adhesion of the coatings were performed using a Nano Indenter XP system with attachments of continuous stiffness measurements (CSM) and lateral force measurements (LFM). Tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated by a fretting wear test. It was concluded that the DLC coatings had a smooth surface morphology with a rms of 6.8 nm and possessed good adhesion to the substrate, they recovered fully elastic at lower load (60 mN) and were ploughed and delaminated only partially at higher load (400 mN). Nevertheless, there was wear debris concurrently generated during the nano-scratch and fretting test, which was more evident at high loads for a definite coatings, indicating an essential necessity of the work to improve the wear resistant of the coatings to avoid the generation of wear debris. The friction coefficient of DLC coatings against corundum obtained by fretting test decreased with the increase of relative humidity, it was below 0.1 in an aqueous condition, this may be beneficial to their biomedical applications in body fluids.

A new ""cold coating technique"" for metallic implants was established to produce a biodegradable coating with a high mechanical stability that provides a continuous release of incorporated growth factors. The properties of this bioactive coating were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed a coating thickness of in average 14.8 mum on titanium and 10.7 mum on steel wires. Intramedullary implantation and extraction experiments depicted a loss of PDLLA coating from titanium and steel implants of less than 5%, After explantation of the implants, the coating displayed a complete and regular layer without any defects of PDLLA uncovering the metallic surface. Smear tests demonstrate that the coating can be performed under sterile conditions. The PDLLA depicted a reduction of about 8% within 6 weeks in vitro and in vivo. The growth factors were incorporated in a stable form and demonstrated a loss of stability of less than 3% within 42 days and less than 5% within one year. In an elution experiment, 54% IGF-I and 48% TGF-beta1 were released within the first 48 h, After 42 days, 76% of IGF-I and 71% of TGF-beta1 were detected in the elution fluid by ELISA, Comparable results were obtained in the in vive experiments after 42 days.

The surfactants were characterized by FTIR and H-1-NMR spectroscopies for purity and composition. Contact-angle and AFM measurements confirmed full monolayer adsorption for all surfactants on a model surface, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, while full coverage was observed on polyethylene only for PVAm (M7:Hex) due to the optimal M7:I-lex ratio and Hex chain density. On graphite, protein resistance increased with increasing coating thickness from 81.4 to 85.8 to 95.8% for the M2, M7, and M15 surfactants, respectively. Additionally, static platelet adhesion on all three surfactants dropped substantially to 15% (M2), 17% (M7), and 16% (M15) compared to glass (adhesion normalized to 100%) and a polyurethane (24%) surface.

The migration of a tissue sheet was enhanced along the microgrooves, while migration across the microgrooves was inhibited. Changing the depth of the microgrooves had a greater effect on migration than alteration of the groove/ridge width. The migration of epithelial cells from a confluent monolayer culture followed a similar pattern to that of intact epithelial tissue. Cellular extensions generally followed the microgroove direction by tracking along the top of the ridges or following the ridge walls, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Actin filaments within the basal cell layer of the tissue were aligned with the microgrooves, unlike filaments in the superficial layers that did not appear to be affected by the presence of underlying microgrooves. The basal cell layer of the tissue conformed to the contours of the microgroove following migration. However, the ultrastructure of the tissue above the ridges resembled that of tissue on a flat surface. We concluded that surface microgrooves have the potential to direct the migration of immediately adjacent epithelial tissue, the effect of which is to guide epithelial tissue on the surface of implanted biomaterials.

However, by optimizing surfaces for tissue integration it is likely that bacterial adhesion may also be affected, resulting in a greater risk of biomaterial-related infection. This could be detrimental to both the implant and the patient because biomaterial related infections are particularly resistant to host defenses and antibiotics. In this study, we analyzed the adhesion of a Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolate and 3T3 rat fibroblasts to tissue culture plastic coated with varying concentrations of fibronectin (Fn). Bacterial adhesion was always lower than tissue culture plastic and appeared to decrease with increasing Fn concentrations. Mammalian cell adhesion to Fn Exceeded adhesion to tissue culture plastic but did not differ significantly over the range of protein concentrations or between 1 and 4 h of incubation. In most casts, the total surface coverage did not vary with time or Fn concentration, indicating that maximal cell adhesion and spreading occurred rapidly and at low protein concentrations. This study suggests that, by controlling the density of proteins or ligands on a surface, we can potentially optimize mammalian cell adhesion without stimulating bacterial adhesion, hence reducing the likelihood of infection.

The aim of this study was to further enhance the bioactivity of glasses by creating a microroughness on their surface. Microroughness increases potential surface area for cell attachment and biomaterial-cell interactions. Three bioactive glasses of different composition were studied. Each material was flame-sprayed into microspheres, and a selected fraction of the spheres (250-300 mum) was sintered to form porous bioactive glass specimens. To create microrough surfaces, different acid etching techniques were tested. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and back-scattered electron imaging of scanning electron microscopy (BEI-SEM) were used to characterize surface roughness. The degree of roughness was measured by AFM. A novel chemical-etching method, developed through intensive screening of different options, was found consistently to create the desired microroughness, with an average roughness value (R-a) of 0.35-0.52 mum and a root mean-square roughness value (R-rms) of 0.42-0.64 mum. Microroughening of the glass surface was obtained even in the internal parts of the porous glass matrices. Measured by BEI-SEM, the etching of a bioactive glass surface did not interfere with the formation of the characteristic surface reactions of bioactive glasses. This was confirmed by immersing the etched and control glass bodies in a simulated body fluid and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane/HCl. The etching process did not significantly affect the mechanical strength of the sintered bioactive glass structures. Based on these experiments, it stems possible to create a reproducible microroughness of appropriate size on the surface of porous bioactive glass. The biologic benefits of such a surface treatment need to be validated with in vivo experiments. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

However, these veins are unavailable in 30-40% of patients. In such a situation, prosthetic grafts provide the only alternative. Since an endothelial cell (EC) lining, important for maintaining a ""haemostatic-thrombotic"" balance, does not develop onto the intima of implanted grafts in humans, these grafts occlude within a short period of time. The failure of vascular grafts is attributed to their characteristics which are nonconducive towards endothelial cell adhesion, spreading and growth. In order to examine whether the patency of vascular grafts can be improved by the surface modification of grafts' intima, small diameter grafts were modified by a novel ammonia plasma treatment to enhance their interactions with EC. Methods. Through laparotomy, ammonia plasma treated ePTFE (4 nun in diameter) grafts (n=3) and control untreated grafts (n=6) were implanted into the distal infrarenal aorta of rabbits. At appropriate time, grafts and adherent tissue were removed, fixed, stained and embedded in Poly/Bed 812. Light microscopic examination of thin sections cut from the proximal and distal anastomatic and midportion segments of explanted grafts was carried out Results. In control group studies, all animals developed lower limb paraplegia within seven days of implantation. Light microscopic examination of explanted control grafts showed that control grafts were obstructed by thrombosis/intimal hyperplasia. However, ammonia plasma modified explanted grafts, after one month of transplantation, revealed an endothelial cell-like lining that covered the grafts' inner surfaces. Accordingly, these grafts remained patent in animals. Conclusions. The grafts' surfaces that are made conducive to EC adhesion and proliferation and host response may influence endothelial regeneration. it is hoped that the combination of angiogenic molecules (ie. endothelial cell specific growth factors such as VEGF) with ammonia plasma modified grafts may provide further insight into the development of ideal small diameter prosthesis.","McGill Univ, Fac Med, Artificial Cells & Organs Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Sipehia, R (reprint author), McGill Univ, Fac Med, Artificial Cells & Organs Res Ctr, 3655 Drummond, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.",,,,,,,30,9,11,0,3,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0021-9509,,,J CARDIOVASC SURG,J.

The blends, consisting of polycaprolactone, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), and hydroxyapatite, have potential use in bone tissue engineering applications, thus it is essential to establish a standardized method of characterizing the degradation of new biomaterials. In this study, the variation in polymer blend ratio was examined to observe a change in degradation rate. The porous blends were degraded in water and serum-containing media. A previous study examined in vitro degradation in serum-free buffer. Molecular weight loss, gravimetric weight loss, pH changes and morphological changes were evaluated. The changes in porosity were observed with scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively assessed using image analysis. There was a significant difference in molecular weight loss and gravimetric weight loss between the blends after 10 weeks in vitro. Blends containing the greatest amount of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) degraded most rapidly.

Many types of polymers are used for biomedical purposes; depending on the application, bioresorbable or non-bioresorbable (semi-crystalline or amorphous) polymers are used. Among bioresorbable polymers, we focused on homopolymers and copolymers based on poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid) and poly(epsilon -caprolactone). Being a nondestructive technique, Raman spectroscopy proved particularly suitable for evaluating the molecular structure and crystallinity of bioresorbable polymers and their degradation products. For various biomedical applications, non-degradable semi-crystalline polymers have been widely employed; in this class of polymers, we concentrated on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) used in orthopaedic implants (total hip and knee joints). Vibrational spectroscopy appeared particularly suitable in studying the oxidation and crystallinity of UHMWPE.

We have investigated four different bone cements in regard to bacterial accumulation of a slime-producing strain RP 62 A and its isogenic mutant M7 lacking the ability to produce exopolysaccharide slime using a bacterial adhesion assay and modified Kirby-Bauer technique. A significant effect of exopolysaccharide production for the accumulation on bone cement could be demonstrated. The gentamicin/clindamycin bone cement was the only tested biomaterial that produced a large zone of bacterial inhibition in the inoculated area adjacent to the biomaterial.

The membranes envelop insulin-producing living pig beta cells. They are biocompatible to the host (human) and the guest (beta cells) and remain permeable for many months in vivo. They are rubbery slippery, robust, sterilizable, optically transparent, with controlled pore dimensions that allow the in-diffusion of glucose and nutrients, out-diffusion of insulin and wastes, but they do not allow the entry of immunoproteins (IgG). The pores remain permeable for many months in vivo. The membranes are made by copolymerizig/crosslinking hydrophilic (meth)acrylates with methacrylate-telechelic polyisobutylenes.

Improved metal alloys, special polymers, and medical grade ceramics are the basis for this success, which has enhanced the quality of life for millions of patients. However, an increasing percentage of our aging population require greater than 30 years survivability of the devices. It is proposed that to satisfy this growing need for very long term orthopaedic repair a paradigm shift is needed; a shift in emphasis from the replacement of tissues to the regeneration of tissues. Such a shift from a materials and mechanics approach to tissue repair requires an increase in the understanding and utilisation of biologically approaches. Two new biologically orientated alternatives in biomaterials for orthopaedics in the new millennium are discussed: tissue regeneration, where in situ repair is initiated in the host tissue, and tissue engineering, where repair is initiated in vitro on cellularly seeded scaffolds and then transplanted to the recipient. The concept of the use of class A bioactive materials to stimulate the regeneration of trabecular bone is described along with clinical applications. Eleven reaction stages lead to the enhanced proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and the recreation of trabecular bone architecture. Recent results showing the effects of microchemical gradients on the genetic activation of bone cells are related to the molecular design of hierarchical bioactive resorbable scaffolds for the tissue engineering of bone constructs.

Three kinds of alkaline compounds, such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, and lithium hydroxide, were used for treatment. Only magnesium treated with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution gave a good corrosion resistance in HBSS solution at 25 degreesC up to 75 days, while almost no effect in sodium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. It was likely that hydrogen carbonate ions were essential for the surface improvement of magnesium. X-ray diffraction patterns of modified magnesium showed now peaks of magnesium carbonate and others on the surface. New surface structure of needle-shaped crystals was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Both elemental mapping, and energy dispersive (EDX) techniques in SEM showed the precipitation of calcium magnesium phosphate (low crystallinity whitlockite:(Ca,Mg)(3)(PO4)(2)) on the surface of magnesium specimen.

Rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were culture-expanded and separately stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) for chondrogenic differentiation or with an osteogenic supplement (OS). MSCs exposed to TGF-beta1 were loaded into a sponge composed of a hyaluronan derivative (HYAF(R)-11) for the construction of the cartilage component of the composite graft, and MSCs exposed to OS were loaded into a porous calcium phosphate ceramic component for bone formation. Cell-loaded HYAFF(R)-11 sponge and ceramic were joined together with fibrin sealant, Tisseel(R), to form a composite osteochondral graft, which was then implanted into a subcutaneous pocket in syngeneic rats. Specimens were harvested at 3 and 6 weeks after implantation, examined with histology for morphologic features, and stained immunohistochemically for type I, II, and X collagen. The two-component composite graft remained as an integrated unit after in vivo implantation and histologic processing. Fibrocartilage was observed in the sponge, and bone was detected in the ceramic component. Observations with polarized light indicated continuity of collagen fibers between the ceramic and HYAFF(R)-11 components in the 6-week specimens. Type I collagen was identified in the neo-tissue in both sponge and ceramic, and type II collagen in the fibrocartilage, especially the pericellular matrix of cells in the sponge. These data suggest that the construction of a tissue-engineered composite osteochondral graft is possible with MSCs and different biomaterials and bioactive factors that support either chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Univ Hosp Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Caplan, AI (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, 2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,"Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,41,189,211,1,17,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,AUG,2001.0,7,4,,,,,363,371,,10.1089/10763270152436427,,,,9,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,459EL,WOS:000170238000001,11506726.0,,,,2019-02-25

We implemented SIP onto a COOH-terminated SAM on gold using a sequential approach to couple an amine-terminated free radical initiator to the terminal COOH groups presented by the SAM, followed by free radical polymerization of styrene. Each step of SIP was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry, and the PS film and micropattern were also characterized by atomic force microscopy. We typically obtained PS films with a thickness of 10-20 nm for a polymerization time of 12-24 h and with a root-mean-square roughness of less than or equal to 50.5 nm. PS micropatterns were also successfully fabricated by reactive mu CP of the initiator onto a COOH-terminated SAM, followed by SIP of styrene. We also demonstrate two potential applications of SIP in biomaterials research: (1) label-free, real-time monitoring of protein adsorption on polymers by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on nanometer thick homogeneous polymer films fabricated on a SAM on gold and (2) patterning cells on micropatterned polymers fabricated by combining mu CP and SIP.","Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Chilkoti, A (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Box 90281, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,,,,,,82,75,76,2,29,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 31,2001.0,34,16,,,,,5644,5652,,10.1021/ma002125u,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,457TD,WOS:000170152200042,,,,,2019-02-25

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is a powerful method for the characterization of adsorbed proteins on biomaterial surfaces due to its chemical specificity and surface sensitivity. However, the SIMS fragmentation patterns for proteins are quite complex due to the heterogeneity of the protein sequence; Therefore, the multivariate analysis technique principal components analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a more detailed interpretation of the protein SIMS spectra. This study utilizes single component adsorbed protein films on three model substrates and multivariate analysis of the ToF-SIMS data to determine the identity of protein films. Furthermore, ToF-SIMS and PCA were used to give insight into the composition of a 1% bovine plasma protein film. The single component spectra from 13 different proteins were readily distinguishable using PCA. The major component of the 1% bovine plasma film was found to shift from fibrinogen to gamma -globulins over the course of 2 h, in agreement with the current literature. This study shows how combination of ToF-SIMS and PCA provides new insights into the composition of adsorbed protein films on biomaterial surfaces.","Univ Washington, Natl ESCA & Surface Anal Ctr Biomed Problems, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Natl ESCA & Surface Anal Ctr Biomed Problems, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Castner, DG (reprint author), Univ Washington, Natl ESCA & Surface Anal Ctr Biomed Problems, Dept Chem Engn, Box 351750, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,,,,76,304,305,4,83,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,JUL 24,2001.0,17,15,,,,,4649,4660,,10.1021/la001209t,,,,12,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,455LX,WOS:000170029300031,,,,,2019-02-25

The properties tested included cross-sectional area, breaking force, peak load, peak stress, stiffness, modulus, hysteresis, and 24-hour load relaxation. The data were analyzed with 1-sample t tests, an analysis of variance, and the Fisher PLSD test. Between GAC and Masel, the GAC non-latex elastics had greater breaking forces than did the Masel non-latex elastics. The Masel latex elastics had greater breaking forces than did the Masel non-latex elastics. The GAC non-latex elastics showed more viscoelastic properties than both the GAC latex elastics and the Masel non-latex elastics; however, the Masel elastics were more viscoelastic than the GAC elastics. Forces generated by the elastics decreased over 24 hours to an average load approximating 75% of the manufacturers' values (GAC latex, Masel latex, and Masel non-latex elastics) and to 60% for the GAC non-latex elastics. The mechanical properties of the non-latex elastics were not comparable to those of the latex elastics. Therefore, the clinical choice of elastics should be based on the patient's medical history and the specific mechanical properties of the type of elastic.","Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Orthodont, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; IWK Grace Hlth Ctr, Div Orthodont, Halifax, NS, Canada; Sch Biomed Engn, Halifax, NS, Canada","Russell, KA (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Orthodont, Room 5164,5981 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",,,,,,,23,26,29,0,3,"MOSBY, INC",ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",0889-5406,,,AM J ORTHOD DENTOFAC,Am.

Thus, understanding the factors influencing the interactions of fibrinogen with biomaterials, and how platelet responses are affected, is crucial for the development of synthetic materials exhibiting improved blood compatibility. In this study, the effects of fibrinogen residence time and shear rate on the procoagulant activity of adherent platelets, along with their morphologic status, as deduced from scanning electron microscopy, were investigated. To examine whether adherent platelets promoted the generation of thrombin, polymeric materials (polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, and silicone rubber) preadsorbed with fibrinogen were exposed to platelet suspensions at different wall shear rates and then incubated with clotting factors for 5 minutes under static conditions. The amount of thrombin generated per platelet was calculated from the optical density of the color developed by adding substrate S-2238. Scanning electron microscopy images of the platelets revealed that the platelets exhibited different morphologies, depending on the shear rate and residence time of the adsorbed fibrinogen, Platelets ranged from their normal discoid shape observed primarily under static conditions, to that of fully spread platelets. Results from this study show that platelets, in the presence of shear forces, undergo activation on exposure to surfaces on which adsorbed fibrinogen has resided for short residence times rather than long residence times. Interestingly, studies examining the procoagulant responses of such adherent platelets demonstrated that the platelets attached to the fibrinogen coated materials did not promote significant thrombin generation. Such low prothrombinase activity of adherent platelets suggests that adsorbed fibrinogen, while capable of supporting platelet adhesion and spreading on biomaterials, does not necessarily enhance the procoagulant activity of adherent platelets.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN USA","Balasubramanian, V (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Div Thrombosis Res, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1269, New York, NY 10029 USA.",,,,,,,19,8,10,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-AUG,2001.0,47,4,,,,,354,360,,10.1097/00002480-200107000-00012,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,451XE,WOS:000169827200012,11482486.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Collision processes between two cloud particles could be treated as composed of three phases: before contact, contact and withdrawal. Interfacial mass and charge transfer between proximal and contacting water or ice surfaces depends on the balance of competing intermolecular interactions at the interfaces. This paper attempts to demonstrate how the Free Energy Reduction by Molecular Interface Crossing (FERMIC) model could be complementarily applied and fully implemented into existing concepts to interpret complex atmospheric charge transfer processes, offering a novel qualitative physical explanation to the experimental results of charge separation in thunderclouds assumed to occur before contact. The FERMIC process has been extensively applied to the understanding of the transfer of mass or charge across liquid interfaces, self-organized molecular assembly in physical and biological processes and in the development of biomaterials. However, it was never used to explain the interfacial mass and charge transfer processes occurring during collisions of hydrometeors in thunderclouds where strong electrification and lightning are common.

The major biological concerns include local cell and tissue necrosis due to the polymerization exotherm and low conversions at greater depths due to light attenuation through thick samples. Experimental results indicate that depth of cure and temperature rises are controllable by altering the photoinitiator concentration, initiating light intensity, and type of photoinitiator. For example, no measurable conversion was detected at a 1.0 cm depth when polymerization was initiated with 1.0wt% DMPA and 100mW/cm(2) ultraviolet light, whereas similar to 40% conversion was obtained when the initiator concentration was lowered to 0.1 wt%. This conversion was further increased to similar to 55% when a photobleaching initiator system was employed. At the highest rate of initiation studied (i.e., 1.0 wt% DMPA irradiated with 100 mW/cm(2) ultraviolet light), a maximum temperature of similar to 49 degreesC was reached at the sample surface; however, this temperature dramatically decreased to similar to 33 degreesC when the light intensity was decreased to 25 mW/cm(2). Finally, dual initiating systems that synergistically combine the advantages of photoinitiation and thermal initiation were investigated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The enzymatic clot degradation was induced through addition of human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to the plasma and the surface protein remnants after the degradation were analyzed with polyclonal antibodies. The results show that the plasma films were not SDS resistant on hydrophilic silicon. However, stability was obtained after preparation on hydrophobic silicon or when albumin or fibrinogen was immobilized to silicon before the plasma incubations.

It has been shown in previous works that by using these polymers it is both possible to produce polymer/hydroxyapatite (HA) composites (with or without the use of coupling agents) with mechanical properties matching those of the human bone, and to obtain 3D structures generated by solid blowing agents, that are suitable for tissue engineering applications. This study was focused on establishing the influence of several additives (ceramic fillers, blowing agents and coupling agents) and processing methods/conditions on the biocompatibility of the materials described above. The cytotoxicity of the materials was evaluated using cell culture methods, according to ISO/EN 109935 guidelines. A cell suspension of human osteosarcoma cells (HOS) was also seeded on a blend of corn starch with ethylene vinyl alcohol (SEVA-C) and on SEVA-C/HA composites, in order to have a preliminary indication on cell adhesion and proliferation on the materials surface. In general, the obtained results show that all tile different materials based on SEVA-C, (which are being investigated for use in several biomedical applications), as well as all the additives (including the novel coupling agents) and different processing methods required to obtain the different properties/products, can be used without inducing a cytotoxic behaviour to the developed biomaterials.

This study was designed to explore the in vitro effects of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se) on polypropylene (PL) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prostheses. Fragments of PL and ePTFE were placed in a medium previously inoculated with Sa, Sr or Sa + Se (1 x 10(8) cfu Sa or/and Se). Bacterial effects on the biomaterials were evaluated for 30 days through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to confirm the presence of bacteria on the prostheses, specimens were Gram stained and challenged with an antibody against protein-a (a specific Sa bacterial wall component). In both methods, specimens were examined by light microscopy. The presence of bacteria as microcolonies or biofilms was detected at PL filament cross-over regions after 30 days. Bacterial colonization of the ePTFE fragments was observed in internodal areas, which led to the deformation of prosthetic filaments. The present findings indicate that Sa and Se colonize the cross-over regions of the PL filaments, whereas in ePTFE prostheses. it is the internodal areas which are mostly affected. The latter areas are of difficult access to defence agents. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For the in vitro analysis cell culture methods were used. The in vivo tissue reactions were evaluated in an intramuscular acid intracortical bone implantation model on goats, using light and scanning electron microscopy. A computerized image analysis system was used to obtain histomorphometric data regarding bone contact and remodelling after 6 and 12 weeks of implantation. In both in vitro and in vivo models, the SEVA-C-based materials did not induce adverse reactions, which in addition to their bone-matching mechanical properties makes them promising materials for bone replacement/fixation.

Initial adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH2 102, Escherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 to these surfaces was measured in a parallel plate flow chamber in phosphate-buffered saline. Adhering bacteria were allowed to multiply by perfusing the flow chamber with growth medium. All bacteria adhered most rapidly to the positively charged surface, but there was no subsequent surface growth of the Gram-negative strains. On the negatively charged surfaces, despite a slower initial adhesion, surface growth of the adhering bacteria was exponential for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains.

The aim of this study is to evaluate a highly sensitive technique for detecting changes at the mRNA level in circulating monocytes and to find suitable ""gene markers"" for assessing the hemocompatibility of biomaterials. Human blood was recirculated in a modified Chandler Loop formed of test tubes. Five groups of biomaterials were compared. Monocytes were separated by using magnetic beads, and gene expression analyses were performed using RT-PCR. We investigated the mRNA expression of stress proteins (hsp70) and inflammatory markers (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). mRNAs for cytokines were highly upregulated in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Hsp70 transcripts were upregulated after heat shock but were not influenced by treatment with LPS. The gene expression of the cytokines was affected by various biomaterials. The intensity of the inflammatory response increased in the following order: heparin coatings (PVC) < uncoated PVC < silicone, polypeptide-coated PVC. No change was seen in the expression of the hsp70 genes. An inhibitory effect of systemic heparin on surface-activated monocytes was observed for the mRNA expression of the cytokines. The recirculation of human blood in an in vitro model in combination with the immunomagnetic separation of monocytes and the Duplex RT-PCR method is a powerful tool for getting reliable results. Our data demonstrate that hsp70 genes cannot be recommended for short-term, biomaterial-induced mRNA expression studies. Conversely, mRNAs for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were expressed in a material-dependent manner. Thus om model provides an effective tool for assessing the hemocompatibility of biomaterials before their clinical application and it also can serve as a safety control during the industrial manufacturing process. This method can be applied to various blood cell populations and numerous gene expression studies and may enable a more fundamental understanding of the biologic processes involved in blood-material interactions.

Using standard cytotoxicity tests, the present study evaluated the biocompatibility of these fibers with cultured bovine tendon fibroblasts. Primary fibroblasts obtained from calf digital extensor tendons were exposed to NDGA, reaction products generated from the polymerization protocol, and the crosslinked fibers. NDGA was cytotoxic to these cells at concentrations above 100 muM NDGA oxidation products were similarly cytotoxic. At concentrations below 100 muM, fibroblast viability was not affected by NDGA or its oxidation products. At these lower concentrations, fibroblast proliferation was unaffected compared to controls not exposed to NDGA. Fibers crosslinked with NDGA contained no unreacted NDGA, but they did contain soluble reaction products that were cytotoxic to tendon fibroblasts in both the elution and the direct contact tests. Washing the fibers in 70% ethanol and phosphate-buffered saline eliminated cytotoxicity of the fibers. Ethanol simultaneously sterilized the fibers. Tensile tests established that the ethanol/phosphate buffer wash did not adversely affect the material properties of the fibers. The results of these experiments indicate that NDGA-crosslinked fibers can be rendered nontoxic to tendon fibroblasts and may provide a novel approach for producing biologically based, biocompatible, tendon bioprostheses.

The present study evaluated the biocompatibility of these fibers with cultured bovine tendon fibroblasts. Fibroblast attachment, migration, and proliferation on NDGA-crosslinked materials were compared to those on prepolymerized type I tendon collagen constructs as well as on tissue-culture-treated plastic. Fibroblast attachment on NDGA-crosslinked collagen fibrils was equivalent to attachment on plates coated with collagen alone. Over a period of 8 days in culture, attached fibroblasts proliferated on NDGA-crosslinked collagen at a rate identical to that of fibroblasts attached to native collagen, in order for the biomaterial effectively to bridge gaps in fibrous tissues, fibroblasts must be able to migrate and replicate on the bridging fiber. Control and crosslinked fibers were inserted in calf tendon explants, with a portion of the fiber extending out of the sectioned end of the tendon. Explants were cultured for 9 weeks, and the number of cells was measured at weekly intervals. Cells appeared on the fibers after 1 week of culture. By 2 weeks, cells had colonized the entire fiber. The number of cells continued to increase throughout the 9 weeks in culture, forming a layer several cells thick. Histologic analysis indicated that the fibroblasts populating the fibers appeared to originate in the epitenon. There was no difference in the rate of fibroblast migration and replication, nor in the ultimate number of colonizing cells, between control collagen fibers and NDGA-crosslinked fibers. NDGA-crosslinked fibers may provide a means of bridging gaps in ruptured, lacerated, or surgically transected tendons by providing a mechanically competent scaffold on which tendon fibroblasts can migrate, attach, and proliferate.

Crosslink efficiency in aortic wail tissue was moderately affected by increasing the fixative concentration from 0.2% GA to 3% GA (SrT degrees from 85.7 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees to 87.5 degrees +/- 0.3 degreesC, p < 0.002; RPD from 24.2 +/- 1.2 to 29.1 +/- 0.7%, p < 0.003; RA from 0.069 +/- 0.004 to 0.058 +/- 0.003 mu mol/mg, p < 0.03, and E-10, from 1.9 +/- 0.11 to 2.94 +/- 0.34 MPa, p < 0.01), but it was distinctly enhanced when diamine bridges were introduced (SrT degrees from 87.5 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees to 93.4 degrees +/- 0.3 degreesC, p much less than 0.0001; RPD from 29.1 +/- 0.7 to 68.4 +/- 1.8%, p much less than 0.0001; and E-10 from 2.94 +/- 0.34 to 6.80 +/- 0.61 MPa, p < 0.0003). Aortic wall calcification was reduced significantly by increasing the GA concentration from 0.2 to 3% [37.8%, p = 0.076 (6 weeks) and 34.0%, p = 0.008 (24 weeks)] and further reduced by the introduction of additional diamine [84.0%, p = 0.006 (6 weeks) and 29.8%, p = 0.037 (24 weeks)]. The combined effect of increased GA concentration plus an interim diamine step on aortic wall tissue resulted in a 90% and 53.7% reduction of calcification after 6 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. The correlation coefficients between calcification and SrT degrees, RDP, and E-10 was -0.9767, -0.9460, and -0.9740, respectively (6 weeks). The inflammatory host reaction regularly found in 0.2%; fixed tissue was practically abolished through the introduction of diamine bridges. Our study demonstrated a distinct correlation between the mitigation of aortic wall calcification and three parameters used to assess crosslink density.

Layered constructs have been fabricated from chemically and mechanically cleaned porcine intestinal collagen using ethyl-3(3dimethylamino) propyl carbodiimide (EDC) and an acetone solvent. By varying the concentration of the crosslinker from 1 to 10 mM and the solvent from 0 to 90% acetone, the strength, stiffness, maximum strain, thermal stability, lamination strength, and suture retention strength can be adjusted. These parameters have either functional importance or the potential to modify the remodeling kinetics, or they have both. This study investigates the interdependence of these parameters, the specific effects that variations in concentration can achieve, and how the two crosslinking variables interact. The results demonstrate that there is substantial latitude in the design of these constructs by these straightforward crosslinking modifications. These data provide the basis for studying the in vivo response to crosslinking conditions that will supply the requisite strength while still allowing host cell infiltration and remodeling.

The lack of an epithelial lining on the luminal surfaces of tracheal prostheses is among the major causes of their failure. Chitosan-gelatin hydrogels were synthesized for the development of biocompatible, growth-supportive substrata for respiratory epithelial cells. We employed J774 macrophages to test the immunocompatibility of this gel. The hydrogel did not exert a cytotoxic effect on macrophages, as confirmed by tetrazolium reduction and neutral red uptake assay. Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages cultured on the hydrogel showed a comparable expression of activation markers CD11b/CD18, CD45, and CD14 to the control. Semiquantitative RT-PCR results showed an absence of upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha in these macrophages with respect to the controls. Primary human respiratory epithelial cells cultured on the hydrogel showed proper attachment, normal morphology, and growth. A small proportion of cells on the hydrogel showed synchronously beating cilia. RT-PCR analysis showed that cells on the hydrogel expressed mucins 2 and 5 and cytokeratin 13, which are markers for secretory goblet and squamous cells, respectively. All these results demonstrate that the hydrogel supports the growth of a mixed population of differentiated epithelial cells. This hydrogel is suitable as a culture substratum for respiratory epithelial cells and could be used as a potential candidate for coating tracheal prostheses.

Porous ceramic implants of alpha -TCP, of glass-ceramic, and of solid composite implants of glass-ceramic/polylactic acid 8 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were fabricated and implanted pressfit into biparietal, full-thickness defects of the calvaria of 60 adult rats. Twenty rats received unfilled defects and served as controls. Fluorochrome labeling of bone formation was performed during the observation period. Five animals from each group were evaluated after 6, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. The control defects showed incomplete regeneration, with bone formation extending 1.66 mm, on average, into the defect after 52 weeks. In the group of alpha -TCP implants, histologic evaluation indicated that the bone formed during initial stages had undergone resorption Later on, so that bone repair after 52 weeks was not significantly enhanced, with an average depth of 1.83 mm of bone ingrowth. The glass-ceramic implants exhibited extensive bone formation and nearly complete repair of the calvarial defect, with 3.90 mm of bone ingrowth into the implant pores. Degradation of the ceramic was nearly complete, with a few remaining particles surrounded by soft tissue. The composite implants showed a negligible bone ingrowth of 0.63 mm, on average. Soft tissue had invaded the polylactic acid implant body, but no bone formation had taken place at the surface of the embedded ceramic particles. Degradation of the polymer was not complete after 52 weeks. It is concluded that the balance between degradation and bone formation is delicate and that chemical events and cellular reaction during degradation may counteract complementary bone ingrowth.

Setting: Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India; Center for Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices, Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Methods. This study comprised 278 eyes of 263 patients having ECCE and 318 eyes of 297 patients having phacoemulsification with PC IOL implantation. Posterior capsule opacification leading to a decrease in Snellen visual acuity of 2 or more lines was considered visually significant. The presence of PCO and IOL haptic fixation were evaluated postoperatively using slitlamp biomicroscopy. Haptic position was noted as in-the-bag (B-B), 1 haptic in the bag and 1 in the sulcus (bag-sulcus [B-S]), or both haptics out of the bag (sulcus-sulcus [S-S]). In addition, the rate of visually significant PCO was compared among 3 IOL biomaterials: poly(methyl methacrylate), silicone, and hydrophobic acrylic. Results: Visually significant PCO occurred in 42.45% of eyes having ECCE and 19.18% of eyes having phacoemulsification (P < .001, chi-square test) after a mean follow-up of 2.4 years +/- 0.7 (SID). In both groups, visually significant PCO was significantly less in eyes with B-B fixation than in those with B-S or S-S fixation (P < .001). The rate of visually significant PCO in all eyes in the phacoemulsification group with B-B fixation was low (11.90%) and was significantly lower in eyes with a hydrophobic acrylic IOL (2.22%; P < .05, chi-square test). Conclusions. In-the-bag PC IOL fixation is required to consistently reduce the incidence of PCO. Thorough removal of lens substance, including hydrodissection-assisted cortical cleanup, and in-the-bag PC IOL fixation seem to be the most important factors in reducing PCO, regardless of surgical procedure or IOL type used. Intraocular lens biomaterial and design also help prevent PCO.

Distraction osteogenesis was performed using an external fixation device. The osteotomy site was surrounded by an external callus, consisting of hyaline cartilage, that contained a large quantity of chondroid bone. Transplanted bone within chondroid bone was characterized by bone formation and remodelling 30 days post-transplantation, and bone adhesion following chondroid bone grafting was better than adhesion following fibula grafting.

These organisms, which are among the most prevalent bacteria of the human skin and mucous membrane microflora, present unique problems in the diagnosis and treatment of infections involving biofilm formation on implanted biomaterials. Epidemiological data that address whether invasive S. epidermidis strains can be traced to commensal organisms or an endemic occurrence of distinct strains with enhanced virulence have important implications for the implementation of appropriate infection control measures. An extracellular polysaccharide adhesin represents a key virulence determinant in S. epidermidis and is required for biofilm formation, Production of this adhesin, which is encoded by the ica operon, is subject to phase variable regulation (ON <----> OFF switching). Recent advances in understanding the molecular events controlling polysaccharide adhesin synthesis and the potential clinical implications of its phase variable regulation are outlined. Further research in this area may contribute to the development of novel strategies for therapeutic intervention. Finally, in addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, preventive strategies to control S, epidermidis medical device-related infections are focusing on the development of improved biomaterials and physical electrical barriers to impede bacterial colonisation.","Beaumont Hosp, Royal Coll Surg Ireland, Dept Clin Microbiol, Educ & Res Ctr, Dublin 9, Ireland","O'Gara, JP (reprint author), Beaumont Hosp, Royal Coll Surg Ireland, Dept Clin Microbiol, Educ & Res Ctr, Smurfit Bldg, Dublin 9, Ireland.",jogara@rcsi.ie,"Humphreys, Hilary/C-9918-2012","O'Gara, James/0000-0003-3866-7161",,,,71,222,228,0,25,MICROBIOLOGY SOC,LONDON,"CHARLES DARWIN HOUSE, 12 ROGER ST, LONDON WC1N 2JU, ERKS, ENGLAND",0022-2615,1473-5644,,J MED MICROBIOL,J.

Bilateral craniotomy was followed by subdural implantation of each hemostatic device. A sham control group was treated in a similar way except that no material was implanted. Implantation of these hemostatic devices for 15, 43, or 92 days did not result in any deaths or clinical neurobehavioral abnormalities, changes in cerebrospinal fluid, or significant macroscopic observations at necropsy. The tissue reaction to SURGIFOAM (TM) sponge was characterized by transient granulomatous inflammation that was slightly less intense than that observed for GELFOAM((R)) sponge which correlated to slightly longer absorption. In contrast, the tissue reaction to Avitene((R)) hemostat was characterized by moderate to marked granulomatous inflammation with an acute inflammatory component indicating a greater degree of tissue irritancy. Sequelae of this reaction were still observed at 92 days post-implantation. The tissue reaction in humans to SURGIFOAM (TM) sponge used as a hemostatic agent for neurologic surgical procedures is expected to be comparable to that observed with CELFOAM((R)) sponge, resulting in no significant adverse reactions for patients. This animal model was useful to assess the tissue reaction and absorption of biomaterials implanted in contact with the central nervous system, and it was able to differentiate between materials of biologic origin.","Ethicon Inc, Div Res & Dev, Somerville, NJ USA; ClinTrials BioRes Ltd, Senneville, PQ, Canada","Barbolt, TA (reprint author), POB 151,Route 22 West, Somerville, NJ 08876 USA.",tbarbolt@ethus.jnj.com,,,,,,12,22,23,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0161-6412,1743-1328,,NEUROL RES,Neurol.

A foldable intraocular lens (IOL) is more expensive than an equivalent rigid IOL. However, surgical and post-operative costs may make a foldable IOL economically preferable. We compared the economic costs of cataract surgery plus implantation of a foldable IOL with implantation of a rigid IOL. Prospective audit of the clinical records of 82 pseudophakes; 39 implanted with a rigid IOL and 43 implanted with a foldable IOL by one surgeon. Average follow-up periods were 25 +/- 7 months and 23 +/- 5 months respectively. There was no difference between the two groups for the follow-up period (P = 0.55), number of post-operative complications (P = 0.25) or cost of post-operative visits (P = 0.83). The cost of single-use theatre equipment was greater for the rigid-IOL group (P = 0.0001). The total identified cost per patient was greater for the foldable-IOL group (P = 0.0001), Despite possible technical advantages, implantation of the foldable IOL did not provide an economic benefit, either in the initial cost or in the costs of post-operative care. Over the 2-year period, implanting with the rigid IOL cost, on average, pound 57 less per patient. Despite this economic difference, a cost-benefit analysis is required, since other factors may be more important. (C) 2001 The College of Optometrists. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The goal of this study was to analyse possible effects of rhBMP-2 on cell differentiation using a human bone marrow cell culture. rhBMP-2 was added to the culture medium once. Fourteen days after addition of rhBMP-2 the cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies. The cells were counted and analysed in a fluorescence-activating cell sorter (FACS), Compared to the controls there was an increasing effect on granulocytes, B cells and stem cells.

The piezoelectric strain tenser element d(14), the elastic constant S-55, and the dielectric permittivity epsilon (11) were measured for collagen films. it was observed that the collagen samples submitted to different pH treatment lead to different electrical behavior. For sample S2. (pH = 5.2) one has a higher denaturation temperature (T-d = 80.55 degreesC), lowest density (rho = 909.6 kg m(-3)), highest dielectric function, lowest frequency constant product (f x L = 320.33 kHz.m) and higher piezoelectricity (d(14) = 0.122 pC/N) which is our major interest in this study. The loss factor Q(-1) measured for all the samples shows that for all the electrodes dimensions sample S2 present the highest loss factor which is between 0.68 and 0.76. We believe that the different pH treatment is critical to the final level of organization of the microscopic structure of the sample. which could result in an increase of the piezoelectricity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relevance of size and chemical composition of biomaterial particles on the pattern of particle distribution in host tissues. Adult female B6C3F1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles (size 1.4 and 6.4 mu in diameter) and polystyrene (PS) particles (size 1.2, 5.2, and 12.5 mu in diameter), and euthanized 1, 7 and 28 days later. Peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were collected and the number of cells and percentage of actively phagocytic cells was determined. Macroscopic examination of the tissues in the peritoneal cavity peritoneum revealed visible accumulations of the colored PS particles in the adipose tissues adjacent to the spleen and pancreas, and caudal to the stomach. Distribution of the FS particles appeared similar regardless of the particle size. The location of PMMA particles, which were not colored, could not be distinguished from host tissue and could not be observed in this manner. Intensive phagocytosis of the small and medium sized particles by peritoneal macrophages was observed on day 1, and was diminishing by day 7 after injection. The largest PS particles (12.5 CL) were not engulfed bp the peritoneal macrophages. Histological examination of the spleen, lymph nodes, and the adjacent adipose tissues revealed a marked difference in the deposition patterns of the two polymers used. PS particles, regardless of size, were accumulated primarily in the white adipose tissues adjacent to the spleen and pancreas gland, but very few particles were observed in the splenic tissue. On the other hand, mice injected with PMMA particles of either size had enlarged and activated spleens with marked deposits of particles in the red pulp. These results indicate that these PS and PMMA particles induce different patterns and intensities of the host response. The chemical makeup of the particle is more important in the distribution pattern than is the size of the particle.

In the presence of biomaterial wear particles, host monocytes/macrophages are activated to synthesize or secrete mediators of inflammation. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the host response to particulates and device-associated infections, we have focused on the effects of medical device particles on macrophage function, because these cells play a pivotal role in the body's response to foreign bodies and their interaction with other cellular components of the immune system. In order to evaluate the effects of particles of medical device materials on functional activities of macrophages, we developed a cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) assay system using J774A.1 macrophages. Constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-I) is present in cells under physiological conditions, whereas inducible COX-II is induced by some cytokines, mitogens, and endotoxin, presumably in pathological conditions such as inflammation. We have evaluated the inductive effects of implant materials, i.e., particles of poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA), hydroxyapatite (HA), titanium oxide, and silica, on the activity of COX-II using thin layer chromatography of prostaglandin D, (PGD,) formed from [1-C-14]-labeled arachidonic acid (AA). Also, we have assessed the synergistic effects of these particles on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage activation. Addition of LPS to these particles increased PGD, production severalfold greater than the addition of any inducer alone. Our results indicated that device-associated infections could enhance inflammatory responses to the wear particles in subjects with medical implants or in whom particulate biomaterials are used for clinical purposes. The use of this model COX-II assay system may lead to the identification of inflammatory potentials for implant materials more specifically than present in vivo assays.

The need for alternative medical solutions has not only extended the requirement for biomedical devices to offer more than just functionality but also bioactivity. A new generation of bioactive materials has emerged promising better properties over existing biomaterials because of their ability-to promote intimate bone growth and rapid fixation. In particular, hydroxyapatite (HA) has been recognised as one bioactive material having the potential and opportunity for development as bone substitutes. Although HA has a similar chemical composition to that of natural bone, it lacks sufficient strength and toughness for use in load bearing applications. Very often it requires blending with a low modulus polymer to achieve adequate toughness. However, the properties of HA composites is highly dependent on the particle size and morphology of the HA filler. Much has been suggested on the benefit of nano particulate materials in achieving higher mechanical properties. The need now arises in developing and processing HA of sufficient fineness for this purpose. As such the synthesis of ultra-fine HA was initiated using RF induction suspension plasma spraying with a wet suspension of HA as feedstock. This was axially injected into the RF plasma at various plate powers (plasma energies), chamber pressures, probe distances and plasma gas flow rates. The processed powders varied in size according to the cyclones designed to collect the powders from medium to ultra-fine. The chamber collecting ultrafine powder contained particles ranging from 10 nm to 4 mum. The particle size, morphology and phase concentration of the powders were characterised using SEM, TEM, XRD and FTIR. In general, the particle size decreased with increasing plate power, while the reverse was observed for the volume of nano-sized particles produced. Decomposition into other phases such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP), tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and calcium oxide (CaO) increased with increasing plate power. This study suggests that the processing parameters associated with the production of the ultra-fine powders interact in a complex manner but can be rationalised by considering the overall thermal treatment experienced by the particulates during plasma treatment.

Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, naturally derived extracellular matrix (ECM) that has been used for tissue remodeling and repair in numerous xenotransplantations. Although a vigorous immune response to xenogeneic extracellular matrix biomaterials is expected, to date there has been evidence for only normal tissue regeneration without any accompanying rejection. The purpose of this study was to determine the reason for a lack of rejection. Methods. Mice were implanted s.c. with xenogeneic tissue, syngeneic tissue, or SIS, and the graft site analyzed histologically for rejection or acceptance. Additionally, graft site cytokine levels were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and SIS-specific serum antibody isotype levels were determined by ELISA. Results. Xenogeneically implanted mice showed an acute inflammatory response followed by chronic inflammation and ultimately graft necrosis, consistent with rejection. Syngeneically or SIS implanted mice, however, showed an acute inflammatory response that diminished such that the graft ultimately became indistinguishable from native tissue, observations that are consistent with graft acceptance, Graft site cytokine analysis showed an increase in interleukin-4 and an absence of interferon-gamma, In addition, mice implanted with SIS produced a SIS-specific antibody response that was restricted to the IgG1 isotype, Reimplantation of SIS into mice led to a secondary anti-SIS antibody response that was still restricted to IgG1, Similar results were observed with porcine submucosa derived from urinary bladder. To determine if the observed immune responses were T cell dependent, T cell KO mice were implanted with SIS. These mice expressed neither interleukin-4 at the implant site nor anti-SIS-specific serum antibodies but they did accept the SIS graft. Conclusions, Porcine extracellular matrix elicits an immune response that is predominately Th2-like, consistent with a remodeling reaction rather than rejection.","Albany Med Coll, Ctr Immunol & Microbial Dis, Albany, NY 12208 USA; Albany Med Coll, Dept Pathol, Albany, NY 12208 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Med Coll Ohio, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Toledo, OH 43614 USA","Metzger, DW (reprint author), Albany Med Coll, Ctr Immunol & Microbial Dis, MC 151,47 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208 USA.",,,"Metzger, Dennis/0000-0002-8000-9907; Badylak, Stephen/0000-0003-3555-0689",NHLBI NIH HHS [HL60359],,,31,217,256,2,21,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0041-1337,,,TRANSPLANTATION,Transplantation,JUN 15,2001.0,71,11,,,,,1631,1640,,10.1097/00007890-200106150-00024,,,,10,Immunology; Surgery; Transplantation,Immunology; Surgery; Transplantation,444VN,WOS:000169420900024,11435976.0,,,,2019-02-25

These cells were used because of the great importance of bone cells in many aspects of biomaterials research. Silane-modified surfaces were characterized by contact angle measurements and, subsequently, surface energies were calculated. Cells grown on clean glass, as well as those grown on glass surfaces containing the functional groups cited above, were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy and assessed for their growth characteristics (i.e., determination of cell number and Ki67 antigen expression). The data presented seemed to indicate that if Saos-2 cells are grown on silane-modifed surfaces containing the methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH), and phenyl (C6H5) functional groups, their proliferation is slowed down while growth of these cells on glass surfaces modified with amino (NH2) and carboxyl (COOH) groups did not significantly affect growth. Once it was demonstrated that these three functional groups induce significant variations in proliferation, cells grown on these surfaces were also tested for apoptosis and expression of important markers of bone cell differentiation (i.e., osteonectin and osteopontin) by flow cytometry and eventual rearrangement of these markers by fluorescence microscopy. The data suggested that growth of Saos-2 cells on CH3 induces the most evident morphological changes while growth of these cells on OH and C6H5 brings about the greater variations in osteonectin and osteopontin. We hypothesized that these changes are indicative of an increase in differentiation of Saos-2 cells when grown on the OH and C6H5 groups.

Frequently, plates or wires are inadequate in fixating all fragments together, resulting in less than optimal outcomes. Advancements in the development of biomaterials have now made titanium mesh a new option for the repair of severely comminuted fractures. Methods: Fourteen patients with severely comminuted frontal sinus fractures were treated with titanium mesh from 1994 to 1999. The fractures were reduced and immobilized using a simple algorithm: (1) Isolated anterior table fractures were repaired with reduced bony fragments attached to titanium mesh. (2) Anterior table fractures with nasofrontal duct involvement were repaired by sinus obliteration and anterior wall reconstruction with reduced bony fragments attached to titanium mesh. (3) Anterior and posterior table fractures with cerebrospinal fluid leak or displacement were treated with the cranialization of the sinus and anterior wall reconstruction with reduced bony fragments attached to titanium mesh. Results: Of the 14 patients treated, 12 were available for postoperative evaluation. Parameters such as nasal function, cranial nerve V and VII function, cosmesis, and complications (hardware extrusions, sinusitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, mucopyocele, brain abscess, pneumocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid leak) were evaluated. All patients had good function of the superior division of cranial nerves V and VII. Two patients (16%) had minor wound infections, which resolved under treatment with antibiotics. All had excellent cosmetic results as measured by postreduction radiographs and personal and family perceptions of forehead contour. Conclusion: Titanium mesh reconstruction of severely comminuted frontal sinus fractures has few complications while providing excellent forehead contour and cosmesis.","Univ Calif Irvine, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Orange, CA 92868 USA; Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Detroit, MI USA","Shibuya, TY (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 101 City Dr S,Bldg 25, Orange, CA 92868 USA.",,,,,,,25,26,26,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0886-4470,,,ARCH OTOLARYNGOL,Arch.

Acrylamide groups readily react with thiol groups, and peptides containing a single thiol group were coupled to the PEG-diacrylamide in aqueous solution at room temperature in about 2 h. If only a portion of the acrylamide groups were targeted for reaction with peptide, sufficient amounts of PEG-diacrylamide remained to be polymerized by free-radical mechanisms via photoinitiation. The photopolymerization step can be performed in contact with cells, providing a means to produce bioactive scaffolds for tissue engineering. The photopolymerization conditions and precursor composition greatly affect the stiffness of the materials, which subsequently affected cell spreading. The kinetics and extent of cell spreading on the bioactive materials were measured and compared to cell spreading on tissue culture polystyrene.

These biomaterials are chemically complex and have been difficult to analyze. Furthermore, the cascade of reactions involving o-quinones is poorly understood, and it has been difficult to mimic ex vivo for materials processing. We report the use of a combinatorial approach to learn how tyrosinase and low molecular weight phenolic precursors can be used to generate biologically active protein-polysaccharide conjugates. Specifically, we screened various phenolic coupling precursors and various reaction conditions for the coupling of proteins onto the polysaccharide chitosan. Several natural phenols were identified as appropriate precursors for the coupling of polyhistidine tagged organophosphorus hydrolase (His-OPH) onto chitosan films. OPH activity was retained upon coupling and subsequent studies indicated that the histidine tag was not necessary for coupling. Using conditions identified for His-OPH coupling, we observed that various biologically active proteins (cytochrome c, OPH, and His-CAT) could be coupled onto chitosan films. The glycosylated protein horseradish peroxidase was not effectively coupled onto chitosan under the conditions studied. In all cases studied, we observed that coupling required a phenolic precursor, suggesting that tyrosinase is unable to couple by reaction with surface tyrosyl residues of the target protein. In conclusion, this study illustrates a combinatorial approach for the ""discovery"" of conditions to couple biologically active proteins onto chitosan through natural, quinone-based processes.","Univ Maryland, Maryland Biotechnol Inst, Agr Biotechnol Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biotecnol, Cuernavaca 62250, Morelos, Mexico; Univ Maryland, Dept Chem Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Payne, GF (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Maryland Biotechnol Inst, Agr Biotechnol Ctr, 5115 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",payne@umbi.umd.edu,"Vazquez-Duhalt, Rafael/E-2751-2016","Vazquez-Duhalt, Rafael/0000-0003-1612-2996",,,,35,60,61,1,24,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,SUM,2001.0,2,2,,,,,456,462,,10.1021/bm000125w,,,,7,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,528RF,WOS:000174256200018,11749206.0,,,,2019-02-25

In addition, during the 72h incubation period light-microscopic observations were performed daily. After 24h of incubation with dextran and dex-HEMA polymers, the cells showed elongated or spider-like forms, some lipid droplets and intracellular granula, indicative of pinocytosis and internalization of the polymers. During the next two days, the fibroblasts' appearance did not change. Methacrylic acid (MAA), formed by hydrolysis of dex-HEMA, did not influence the cell morphology. Dex-HEMA polymer solutions with a low and high degree of substitution (DS) at 100 mg/ml caused a CPII of 30-40% after 72 h. This is less than 10% growth inhibition per cell cycle and statistically not different from the CPII induced by 100 mg;ml dextran T40. Growth inhibition induced by MAA was also low. The various dex-MA hydrogel discs caused similar low growth inhibition. Interestingly, hydrogel microspheres of dex-MA and dex-(lactate)HEMA caused a CPII of only 0-20% after 72 h. The results presented in this study demonstrate that methacrylate-derivatized dextran hydrogels show good biocompatibility in vitro making these degradable biomaterials promising systems for drug delivery purposes.

Additionally, only after the second challenge clusters and accumulations of plasma cells were present in the surrounding tissue of each type of material. Tn the same areas an increase of MHC II expression was measured by immunocytochemistry. Differences in the numbers of macrophages and T cells were not observed around the explants. Undifferentiated B cells or NK cells were not present at any time point. The results indicate that alterations observed after the second challenge did not depend on biodegradation of the materials.

In the cartilage of the external ear of the rabbit multiple holes, 6 mm in diameter, were punched, leaving the adherent skin intact. Different experimental groups were evaluated. First, the punch-hole model was validated under various conditions to study spontaneous or perichondrial initiated regeneration of the cartilage defect. When both cartilage and perichondrium was excised no spontaneous repair of the cartilage defect was observed. When perichondrium is present, variable patch-like closure of the punch hole was found. As 'golden standard' a punched out piece of cartilage was reimplanted directly. This condition showed adequate closure of the punch hole, however, no perfect integration of graft and surrounding cartilage was observed. Secondly, to evaluate the 'punch-hole model' a biomaterial, trabecular demineralized bovine bone matrix (DBM), was implanted and tested as a scaffold for tissue engineering techniques in vivo and in vitro. Direct implantation of DBM did not lead to any cartilage formation to close the defect. In vivo engineered cartilage, generated by enveloping DBM in perichondrium for 3 weeks, could adequately close the punch hole. When DBM was seeded with isolated chondrocytes in vitro before implantation in the defect, a highly fragmented graft, with some islets of viable cells was seen. To promote an efficient and reliable evaluation of cartilage grafts a semi-quantitative grading system was developed. Items such as quality, quantity and integrity of the cartilage graft were included in a histomorphological grading system to provide information about the properties of a specific cartilage graft. To validate the grading system, all conditions were scored by two independent observers. An excellent reliability (R = 0.96) was seen between the observers. In summary, the rabbit pinna punch-hole model is a reliable and efficient method for first evaluation of cartilage grafts. The results can be easily analyzed using a semi-quantitative grading system.

The contribution of biological molecules on cell-bioactive glass interaction is largely unknown. To further analyze the mechanisms involved in efficient bone bonding to bioactivity glass, Saos-2 osteoblastic cells with proven osteogenic phenotype were cultured for 4, 7 and 14 days on two bioactive glasses with different Si contents. Culture plates and dishes made of bioactive (BAG, 53% SiO2), biocompatible (BCG, 58% SiO2) and control (G0) glasses were extensively conditioned with phosphate buffer and DMEM medium before seeding the cells. Northern hybridization was used for analysis of mRNA levels of collagen type I (Col-I), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). A significant increase was observed in Col-I mRNA levels in cells grown on the two bioactive glasses when compared with those grown on controls at 4 and 7 days (p < 0.04), The mRNA level for ALP in the cultures of bioactive glasses-made plates and dishes was also increased over control at 7 days (p < 0.02) and remained this way between BAG and GO at 14 days. Striking differences in BMP-2 mRNA levels existed between BAG and CO plates and dishes at 7 days (p < 0.05). BMP-2 mRNA level in BAG group was higher than in BCG group at 4, 7 and 14 days, but without statistical significance. Saos-2 osteoblastic cells with strong ALP staining were mostly seen on BAG plates under a light microscope. In confocal microscopy, a bright FITC-stained F-actin ring was present in the cytoplasm of cells grown on BAG dish, demonstrating an active Functional status. Stimulation of the expression of BMP-2 and other bone mRNAs by bioactive glasses in osteoblastic cells suggests biological involvement of bone related growth factors, peptides and cytokines in bone - bioactive glass bonding.

So Far, non destructive analysis have been performed using contact radiography giving the scope for great advances in the production and application of new materials. However. the nature of interaction. namely X-ray absorption, limited the observations only to materials having sufficient heavy elements content. The adoption of a different X-ray interaction with matter which involves refractive properties of materials is at the basis of phase-contrast imaging. The novel method allows the use of high X-ray energies. for a deeper penetration and a lower released dose, without losing any information on the nature of the sample. A demonstration study. performed at the third generation European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)-Grenoble, to show the potential of the new technique applied to biomaterials characterization is presented here. The test samples are a commercial matrix barrier (GUIDOR) intended to aid the healing process after periodontal surgery and a hydroxyapatite thin slab originally deposited by plasma spray technique on a TA6V alloy substrate. Phase-contrast images showed significant advantages revealing features that have negligible absorption contrast. The technique can be successfully used for the characterization of biomaterials.

Polyurethane membranes were Found to exhibit significant differences depending on their surface properties prepared by different fabrication processes. When myoblasts were cultured on polyurethane surfaces, the smooth and hydrophobic membrane (F1), prepared by the solvent evaporation process, showed the greatest inhibition of myoblast adhesion compared with other porous and hydrophilic membranes (F2, F3 and F4), prepared by immersing the polymer solution into a precipitation bath. In contrast, IL-l generation by monocytes/macrophages on the membrane F1 was more severe than those on the porous and hydrophilic membranes.

Composites of PET with wollastonite in two different proportions, viz. 70/30 (PW-30), 50/50 (PW-50) were prepared. The DSC studies indicate marginal changes in the melting behavior and enhanced crystallization in PBT/W composites. The mechanical properties of the composites such as tensile modulus shows remarkable improvement as a result of incorporation of wollastonite. SEM studies of fractured surfaces of impact samples showed no evidence of bonding between PET and wollastonite. Water contact angle of PW30 and PW50 was 73.7 and 78.7 degrees, respectively. In vitro biocompatibility of PW-30 was evaluated as a representative composite. Direct cell contact test did not show deleterious effects on NIH3T3 fibroblast morphology and DNA integrity indicating its compatibility. Leach out products (LOP) of PW-30 were evaluated non-toxic as tested by MTT assay. Mouse peritoneal macrophages in contact with PW-30 showed comparable expression of CD 11b/18, CD45, CD14 and B7.2 to macrophages in contact with PTFE control indicating its non-activating nature. LOP did not induce proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes suggesting its immune-tolerance. PW-30 also exhibited preliminary blood compatibility. These physical properties and biocompatibility of PBT/W composites show their suitability as potential biomaterials. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The influence of gentamicin release on biofilm formation was quantified by expressing the number of colony-forming units on gentamicin-loaded cement relative to the number of viable organisms on unloaded cement of the same brand. Biofilms formed on all gentamicin-loaded cements, despite the release of antibiotics. followed a consistent pattern in time with a maximum number of colony-forming units per unit cement area found between 24 and 30 h after inoculation. None of the gentamicin-loaded cements showed a reduction in biofilm formation relative to unloaded cements within 6 h after inoculation, whereas only gentamicin-loaded CMW1 and Palacos reduced biofilm formation 24 h after inoculation. Alternatively, CMW Endurance. CMW2000, and Palamed did not exhibit any initial reductions in biofilm formation, but effects started after 72, 48, and 72 h. respectively. Biofilm reduction by gentamicin-loaded CMW3 lasted the longest from 24 to 72 h. Interestingly, each cement seemed to have a different ""window-of-effectiveness"" with regard to reduction in biofilm formation that did not relate with the gentamicin-release kinetics. Summarising, this study demonstrates that although gentamicin loading of bone cements yields reductions in biofilm formation, S. aureus is able to grow on gentamicin-loaded bone cements.

Several materials and devices have been developed to circumvent the problem of islet rejection by the recipient, but, so far, none has proved to be totally effective. A major barrier to transpose is the highly organized islet architecture and its physical and chemical setting in the pancreatic parenchyma. In order to tackle this problem, we assembled a multidisciplinary team that has been working towards setting up the Human Pancreatic Islets Unit at the Chemistry Institute of the University of S (a) over tildeo Paulo, to collect and process pancreas from human donors, upon consent, in order to produce purified, viable and functional islets to be used in transplants. Collaboration with the private enterprise has allowed access to the latest developed biomaterials for islet encapsulation and immunoisolation. Reasoning that the natural islet microenvironment should be mimicked for optimum viability and function, we set out to isolate extracellular matrix components from human pancreas, not only for analytical purposes, but also to be used as supplementary components of encapsulating materials. A protocol was designed to routinely culture different pancreatic tissues (islets, parenchyma and ducts) in the presence of several pancreatic extracellular matrix components and peptide growth factors to enrich the beta cell population in vitro before transplantation into patients. In addition to representing a therapeutic promise, this initiative is an example of productive partnership between the medical and scientific sectors of the university and private enterprises.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Univ Miami, Diabet Res Inst, Miami, FL USA; Biobras SA, Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; Hosp Beneficencia Portuguesa, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Hosp Heliopolis, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Sogayar, MC (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Caixa Postal 26077, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",,"Aita, Carlos Alberto/C-2243-2008; Correa-Giannella, Maria Lucia/D-2003-2012; Maria-Engler, Silvya/K-5936-2016","Aita, Carlos Alberto/0000-0003-4871-7740; Correa-Giannella, Maria Lucia/0000-0003-3655-4446; Maria-Engler, Silvya/0000-0003-4771-6041; Sogayar, Mari/0000-0003-4805-4609",,,,53,20,24,0,3,ASSOC BRAS DIVULG CIENTIFICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE MEDICINA, SALA 21, 14049 RIBEIRAO PRETO, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",0100-879X,,,BRAZ J MED BIOL RES,Brazilian J.

Research results demonstrate that hydroxyapatite (HA) stimulates DNA synthesis and collagen formation on the material whereas this stimulation is restricted by adding spinel to the materials. There are statistical differences between the influences of material components on both DNA synthesis and collagen formation. It is supposed that porous materials can supply more platforms for cell anchoring, and more DNA and collagen are synthesised on the porous materials.

Semiconductor and optical materials, composites, ceramics, biomaterials, advanced polymers, and specialized alloys are some of the materials that have seen intense interest and research activity over the last two decades. New approaches have been developed to improve product quality reduce cost, and achieve essentially custom-made material properties. Current trends indicate continued research effort in materials processing as demand for specialized materials continues to increase. Fluid flow that arises in many materials processing applications is critical in the determination of the quality and characteristics of the final product and in the control, operation, and optimization of the system. This review is focused on the fluid flow phenomena underlying a wide variety of materials processing operations such as optical fiber manufacture, crystal growth for semiconductor fabrication, casting, thin film manufacture, and polymer processing. The review outlines the main aspects that must be considered in materials processing, the basic considerations that are common across fluid flow phenomena involved in different areas, the present state of the art in analytical, experimental and numerical techniques that may be employed to study the flow, and the effect of fluid flow on the process and the product. The main issues that distinguish flow in materials processing from that in other fields, as well as the similar aspects, are outlined. The complexities that are inherent in materials processing, such as large material property changes, complicated domains, multiple regions, combined mechanisms, find complex boundary conditions are discussed. The governing equations and boundary conditions for typical processes, along with important parameters, common simplifications and specialized methods employed to study these processes are outlined. The field is vast and it is not possible to consider all the different techniques employed for materials processing. Among the processes discussed in some detail are polymer extrusion, optical fiber drawing, casting continuous processing, and chemical vapor deposition for the fabrication of thin films. Besides indicating the effect of fluid flow on the final product, these results illustrate the nature of the basic problems, solution strategies, and issues involved in the area. The review also discusses present trends in materials processing and suggests future research needs. Of particular importance are well-controlled and well-designed experiments that would provide inputs for model validation and for increased understanding of the underlying fluid flow mechanisms. Also, accurate material property data are very much needed to obtain accurate and repeatable results that can form the basis for design and optimization. There is need for the development of innovative numerical and experimental approaches to study the complex flows that commonly arise in materials processing. Materials processing techniques that are in particular need of further detailed work are listed Finally, it is stessed that it is critical to understand the basic mechanisms that determine changes in the material, in addition to the fluid flow aspects, in order to impact on the overall field of materials processing.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA","Jaluria, Y (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",,,,,,,145,32,32,0,21,ASME-AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENG,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0098-2202,,,J FLUID ENG-T ASME,J.

This process, known as the foreign body reaction (FBR), develops in response to almost all biomaterials and consists of overlapping phases similar to those in wound healing. Implantation of porous biomaterials, such as polyvinyl alcohol sponges, also leads to granuloma formation within the interstices of the sponge prior to encapsulation by the FBR. We asked whether delivery of an antisense cDNA for the potent angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin (TSP) 2 would enhance blood vessel formation and alter collagen fibrillogenesis in the sponge granuloma and capsule. Collagen solutions were mixed with plasmid to generate gene-activated matrices (GAMs) and applied to biomaterials that were then implanted subcutaneously. Sustained expression of plasmid-encoded proteins was observed at 2 weeks and a month following implantation. In vivo delivery of plasmids, encoding either sense or antisense TSP2 cDNA, altered blood vessel formation and collagen deposition in TSP2-null and wild-type mice, respectively. Untreated implants, implanted next to CAM-treated implants, did not show exogenous gene expression and did not elicit altered responses, suggesting that gene delivery was limited to implant sites. This method of antisense DNA delivery has the potential to improve the performance and life span of implantable delivery devices and biosensors.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bornstein, P (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Box 357350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [AR45418]; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL18645],,,35,40,42,0,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1525-0016,,,MOL THER,Mol.

Recently, new biologic approaches employing growth factors have been utilized to treat various pathological conditions. Among them, transfer of genes such as those encoding growth factors represents a promising way to deliver therapeutic proteins to malfunctioning tissues, which leads to the improvement of organ function. Tissue engineering, which may eventually be combined with gene therapy, also offers the potential to create new functional genitourinary tissue for regeneration and replacement of tissue lost as a consequence of disease. Thus, both tissue engineering and gene therapy may hold promising new solutions in the urologic field.","Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent, Dept Urol, Okayama 7008558, Japan; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet & Biochem, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Yokoyama, T (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent, Dept Urol, 2-5-1 Shikata, Okayama 7008558, Japan.",,,,,,,36,2,3,1,1,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1091-5362,,,MOL UROL,Mol.

An unconstrained prosthesis design best reproduces the physiological articulation and original anatomy of the shoulder. Humeral head components have been recently developed, which are adaptable to the variable anatomy of the proximal humerus (third generation design). A precise reconstruction of the three dimensional structure of the proximal humerus may lead to an improved functional outcome. However, there is still a lack of biomechanical data to support this concept. The optimal design of the glenoid component remains a challenge for future research. Specific issues including the choice of biomaterials, the optimum shape, radius of curvature, surface area of the articulation, component height and stem design remain under investigation. Although the prosthetic design represents an important factor in the success of glenohumeral arthroplasty, the surgical reconstruction of the soft tissues to recreate the normal soft tissue balance as well as postoperative rehabilitation determine the functional outcome.","Orthopad Univ Klin Regensburg, D-93077 Bad Abbach, Germany","Heers, G (reprint author), Orthopad Univ Klin Regensburg, Kaiser Karl V Allee 3, D-93077 Bad Abbach, Germany.",guido.heers@klinik.uni-regensburg.de; an.kainan@mayo.edu,,,,,,52,7,7,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0085-4530,1433-0431,,ORTHOPADE,Orthopade,JUN,2001.0,30,6,,,,,346,+,,10.1007/s001320170083,,,,8,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,457KH,WOS:000170135800002,11480086.0,,,,2019-02-25

However, in vitro and in vivo calcifications of these polymers have been found to seriously compromise their quality as biomaterials. Zn consideration of this problem, the present study compared the calcification rate and extent of PTFE, PU and silicone. Using the in vitro flow-type method, PTFE, PU and silicone mms were tested for 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days. After 21 days of in vitro calcification test, the calcium levels on PTFE, PU and silicone were 35.89 +/- 5.01 mug/cm(2) 23.73 +/- 0.68 mug/cm(2) and 19.86 +/- 5.28 mug/cm(2), respectively. The higher observed calcium level for PTFE may be due to the effect of the rough surface of PTFE in accumulating calcium ions on the polymer surface From the 7th day of feat, the [Ca]/[P] molar ratio started to decrease over time, and PTFE showed a faster calcification process. This decreasing [Ca]/[P] molar ratio demonstrated the typical calcification mechanism consisting of phosphorus ion accumulation following calcium ion accumulation. This. study concluded that PU and silicone are less calcified than PTFE film, a finding in good agreement with previously published studies.","Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, Seoul 120752, South Korea","Suh, H (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",,,,,,,29,10,10,0,6,YONSEI UNIV COLLEGE MEDICINE,SEOUL,"C/O KYUN0-IL IM, M.D., PH.D, SHINCHON DONG 134, SEODAEMOON KU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

We have deposited uniform 10 nm to nearly 1 mum thin films of insulin and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). We performed several experiments to characterize the chemical integrity of the deposited films. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments performed on MAPLE-deposited insulin films indicate that the laser-material interaction involved in this deposition technique does not modify the protein's mass. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the chemical functionality and secondary structure of MAPLE-deposited HRP are nearly identical to those of the native protein. We also find that deposited HRP films retain their ability to catalyze the reduction of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), suggesting that the active site of transferred proteins is unaffected by the MAPLE process. We also produced patterns and multilayers with feature sizes from 20 to 250 mum by depositing different biomaterials through a shadow mask. Patterns of physisorbed HRP were then protected from dissolution in an aqueous environment by a semipermeable polymer overlayer that was deposited in situ using pulsed laser deposition. This polymer membrane protects the protein pattern when it is exposed to DAB solution and enables the optical observation of HRP activity for spots as small as 2000 mum(2). These results demonstrate that MAPLE is a preferred technique for depositing active biomolecules for applications ranging from microfluidic sensor devices to gene and protein recognition microarrays.","USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; So Oregon Univ, Dept Phys, Ashland, OR 97520 USA","Ringeisen, BR (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Code 6372, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",,,,,,,52,102,102,0,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 29,2001.0,17,11,,,,,3472,3479,,10.1021/la0016874,,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,436UY,WOS:000168955300048,,,,,2019-02-25

Samples of bone tissue have been retrieved at different times after implantation for spectroscopic study. The ratio of bone components has been calculated from the FTIR spectra of the samples. based on the integrated areas of the bands brought about by the vibrations of phosphates and amide groups. Additionally: the analysis of the shape and intensity of these bands provided information on developing and on the rate of bone mineralization.

Degree of equilibrium swelling, scanning electron microscopy, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) were used to characterize the bulk and surface properties. Vitamin B(12) and human serum albumin were used as permeability markers. Platelet adhesion and activation were used to determine the blood-interaction properties of the PIN membranes. Unlike chitosan membranes that were nonporous, the chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes were highly porous with the pore size, depending on the type of incorporated Pluronic polyol. ESCA results showed a significant increase in the -(C) under bar -O- signal of C1s spectra on the PIN membranes that correlates with the presence of PEO chains on the surface. The permeability coefficients of vitamin B(12) and albumin were higher in the chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes than in the control. The number of adherent platelets and the extent of activation were significantly reduced on the chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes. The decrease in platelet adhesion and activation correlated positively with the PEO chain length of the incorporated Pluronic polyols. The results of this study show that chitosan-Pluronic PIN membranes offer a blood-compatible alternative with a higher-molecular-weight cutoff for use in hemodialysis and related applications.

However, the drawbacks of these biomaterials are poor durability and relatively high costs of production. Thus, the technique of molecular imprinting [Bio/Technology 14 (1996) 163; Angew. Chem. Int.

For this purpose, a stable transition state analogue (TSA) of a selected reaction must be chosen as template [Macromol. Rapid Commun. 19 (1998) 671; Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 3 (1999) 759]. The imprint of the TSA acts like a catalytically active centre. This binding site shows its catalytic effect by reducing the activation energy of the specific reaction. In the work presented here, molecularly imprinted catalytically active polymers have been generated and investigated in chemical reaction engineering processes, using batch reactors and continuously driven reactors equipped with these polymers. Parameters such as temperature, concentration of substrate or volume flow have been varied, reaction rates measured and kinetic data recorded. Based on this information, the rate constants of the reaction have been calculated, as well as the relative catalytic effects. It is demonstrated that imprinted polymer catalysts show obvious catalytic properties and can be used as an alternative for traditional catalyst materials. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mechanical properties of the blend films containing 10-40% chitosan were found to be excellent. The tensile strength, breaking elongation, and Young's modulus were affected by the chitosan contents of the blend films, which were also related to the density and degree of swelling. The coefficient of water vapor permeability of the blend films increased linearly with the chitosan content, and the values of 1000-2000 g m(-2) day(-1) were comparable to those of commercial wound dressings. Silk fibroin/chitosan blend films had good oxygen and water vapor permeabilities, making them useful as biomaterials.

In CRI, the sample is modulated at a resonance frequency of the tip-sample contact, while the average position of the tip still remains in contact with the surface, i.e. in the repulsive region of the force-distance curve. The improvement in image resolution is demonstrated using various biological and polymeric specimens under ambient laboratory conditions and in liquid media.

The sputter-deposition of the pure titanium film and the Ti-O films were carried out in Ar gas and in Ar-O-2 gas mixtures, respectively. Both the pure titanium film deposited in Ar and the Ti-O films deposited in Ar-O-2 appeared to be uniform and adhesive. Under AES, the Ti/O ratio in depth direction was nearly constant in each of the films and oxygen concentration increased with increasing oxygen content of the sputter gas. Based on XRD, it was concluded that oxygen atoms dissolved into or-titanium crystals at lower oxygen contents, while suboxides such as Ti4O7 and Ti6O11 and oxides such as TiO2(anatase) were formed at higher oxygen contents. It was found that the orientation of the or-titanium phase formed in the Ti-O films changed from (002) dominant to (011) dominant with increasing oxygen content. The Vickers hardness of the films increased linearly with increasing oxygen content, and the maximum hardness reached over Hv = 1600. Furthermore, it was found that the ductility of the deposited pure titanium film was improved under such high temperatures as 800 degreesC and that its elongation reached over 160%, while the Ti-O films were still brittle under such a high temperature.

Novel techniques of surface modification by addition of tethered chains can lead to materials with the ability to recognize biological and pharmaceutical compounds. Methods based on molecular imprinting can increase the recognition capabilities of such systems. Chain tethering can also can improve the mucoadhesive behavior of a delivery device and the effectiveness of a drug by allowing targeting and localization of a drug at a specific site. Acrylic-based hydrogels are well-suited for mucoadhesion due to their flexibility and nonabrasive characteristics which reduce damage-causing attrition to the tissues in contact. However, the adhesive and drug delivery capabilities of these devices can continue to be improved as presently known bioadhesive materials are modified and more bioadhesive materials are discovered. Tethering of long PEG chains on PAA hydrogels rind their copolymers can be achieved by grafting reactions involving thionyl chloride, followed by PEG grafting. The ensuing materials exhibit mucoadhesive properties due to enhanced anchoring of the chains with the mucosa. Theoretical calculations can lead to optimization of Be tethered structure.

Genetically engineered coiled coils have been used as a structural module for the construction of a variety of bio-based systems useful in drug delivery studies. Two of such approaches developed in the authors' laboratory were described here. One approach was to assemble hybrid hydrogels from coiled coil protein domains and synthetic polymers. Preliminary results showed that temperature-sensitive volume transition of the hybrid hydrogels could be triggered by the thermal unfolding of the engineered coiled coil protein domains. The other approach, discussed in detail, was to construct an epitope display model system based on a coiled coil stem loop peptide self-assembled on a solid substrate. This model construct displayed a constrained nonapeptide sequence, which was found to mediate specific binding with immunocompetent cells bearing complementary surface receptors. These novel approaches will likely find important applications in the rational design of more effective drug delivery systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

The modified films were investigated with respect to their affinity to fibroblast and endothelial cells, as well as their antibacterial properties tested by adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus. Modifications that only change the net charge of collagen, such as acetylation, succinylation, and treatment with glutaraldehyde tall increase the negative charge), and amination with ethylenediamine (EDA), N,N-dimethyl-EDA (DMEDA), or butylamine tall increase the positive charge), did not dramatically alter the mammalian cell attachment to the film. In contrast, derivatization of collagen using methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG] diminished the attachment of fibroblasts by 98 +/- 1% and of endothelial cells by more than 99% compared to unmodified collagen. Moreover, the rate of growth of fibroblasts dropped by 97 +/- 1% and that of endothelial cells by 88 +/- 3% as a result of PEGylation of collagen. Adhesion of S. aureus cells also plummeted by 93 +/- 2% as a result of this PEGylation. With these antifouling properties, PEG-collagen may be a promising coating material for coronary stents. Subsequent derivatization of PEG-collagen with EDA or DMEDA abolished its mammalian cell-repelling ability, whereas bacterial cell repulsion was partially retained: for example, DMEDA-modified PEG-collagen exhibits up to a 5-fold lower bacterial adhesion than collagen. It is worth noting that a material that allows mammalian cell attachment but reduces bacterial adhesion could be useful as an implant or coating.

Calcific degeneration is the major drawback of bioprostheses. None of the numerous preventive approaches omitted calcification. Previous studies showed that cellular surface seeding decreases calcium uptake in vitro but achievement of coverage remains problematic. A new approach is presented masking glutaraldehyde residues with a polymer layer allowing cell seeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate different polymers for suitability. Methods. Ten polymers-covalently bound to glass-were tested for their ability to seed animal and human cells. Quality of coverage was evaluated by light and scanning electron microscopy, and polymers were characterized physicochemically. Results. Quality of cellular growth was similar for canine and human cells. Five polymers allowed excellent surface coverage, two led to a decrease of cell adherence, and four to poor cellular growth. No correlation between molecular weight, thickness, hydrophilicity, or charge of the polymer and cell growth was found. Conclusions. Polymer monolayers can promote cellular growth but without correlation to physicochemical characteristics. Polymers covalently bound to biologic tissue appear to be a promising approach for achieving cellular coverage of biomaterials.

This paper describes a preliminary study on the development of a new method to produce biodegradable scaffolds from a range of corn-starch-based polymers. In some cases, hydroxlapatite was also used as a reinforcement of the biodegradable polymers. The developed methodology consists of a standard conventional injection moulding process, on which a solid blowing agent based on carboxylic acids is used to generate the foaming of the bulk of the moulded part. The proposed route allows for the production of scaffolds with a compact skin and a porous core, with promising mechanical properties. By using the developed method it is possible to manufacture biodegradable polymer scaffolds in an easy (melt-based processing) and reproducible manner. The scaffolds can be moulded into complex shapes, and the blowing additives do not affect the non-cytotoxic behaviour of the starch-based materials. The materials produced using this method were evaluated with respect to the morphology of the porous structure, and the respective mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. It was demonstrated that it is possible to obtain, by a standard melt based processing route, 3D scaffolds with complex shapes that exhibit an appropriate morphology, without decreasing significantly the mechanical properties of the materials. It is believed that the optimisation of the proposed processing methodology may lead to the production of scaffolds that might be used on the regeneration of load-bearing tissues.

We report on the ability of covalently bound PEG films in long-term cell culture to continually retard protein adhesion and cell growth. PDMS microstamps were used to create poly-d-lysine (PDL) substrates permissive to cell attachment and growth, and polyethylene glycol(PEG) substrates were used to minimize protein and cell adhesion. Film thickness was measured using null ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Organosilane film structure was examined using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Long-term film stability in cell culture conditions was tested by immersion in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for up to one month. Null ellipsometry and water contact measurements indicated that organosilane films were stable up to one month, whereas the PEG film thickness declined rapidly after day 25. Hippocampal cells plated at 200 cells/mm(2) on uniform PEG substrates gave a steady increase in biofilm thickness on PEG films throughout the culture, possibly from proteins of neuronal origin. We found that all the layers in the cross-linking procedure were stable in cell culture conditions, with the exception of PEG, which degraded after day 25. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One hypothesis is that an electrical stimulus alters the local electrical fields of extracellular matrix molecules, changing protein adsorption. We have investigated this hypothesis - that electrical stimulation increases the adsorption of serum proteins, specifically fibronectin (FN), to the electrically conducting polymer polypyrrole (PP), thereby, increasing neurite extension. PP was used because electrical stimulation of PP has been shown to significantly enhance neurite outgrowth, and more importantly, PP can be formed into conduits to guide nerve regeneration in vivo. Here, we looked at the effects of electrical stimulation on protein adsorption when an electrical current was applied to PP (1)during protein adsorption (immediate stimulation) and (2) several hours after protein adsorption (delayed stimulation). We found that immediate stimulation of PP increases FN adsorption from purified FN and serum-containing solutions. Correspondingly, PC-12 cells grown on PP films that had been previously adsorbed with FN during immediate stimulation expressed longer neurites. However, for delayed stimulation, no significant differences in adsorption or neurite outgrowth were observed. These studies suggest that increased FN adsorption with immediate electrical stimulation may explain enhanced neurite extension on electrically stimulated PP. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. Results. In the suspension test, all gramnegative species were inhibited, but grampositive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient.

In conclusion,we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.","Univ Jena, HNO Klin, D-07740 Jena, Germany","Koscielny, S (reprint author), Univ Jena, HNO Klin, Lessingstr 2, D-07740 Jena, Germany.",Sven.Koscielny@med.uni-jena.de,"Koscielny, Sven/F-8547-2010",,,,,22,11,11,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0017-6192,1433-0458,,HNO,HNO,MAY,2001.0,49,5,,,,,367,371,,10.1007/s001060050764,,,,5,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,434CD,WOS:000168796800007,11405144.0,,,,2019-02-25

A major consideration in designing implants has been to produce surfaces that promote desirable responses in the cells and tissues. To achieve these requirements, the titanium implant surface can be modified in various ways. This research was designed to elucidate the relationship between surface roughness (R-a) and contact angle (theta) of various engineered titanium surfaces of commercially pure titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), and titanium-nickel (TiNi) alloy. The contact angle was measured using distilled water, 1% sodium chloride solution, human neutrophils, and osteoblast-like cells. Surface oxide crystallography was identified by transmission electron diffraction, It was found that: (1) there were no significant differences in contact angles among the 4 media; (2) for commercially pure titanium, a combined treatment (hydrofluoric acid/nitric acid/water --> sodium hydroxide --> oxidation) showed the lowest theta (10.51 degrees in water), while the surface treated with sulfuric acid showed the highest value (72.99 degrees in water); (3) for all commercially pure titanium samples, when theta is greater than 45 degrees, the contact angle increases linearly with R-a (hydrophobic nature) and the surface is covered with rutile-type oxide only, while the contact angle decreases linearly with R-a when theta is less than 45 degrees (hydrophilic nature) and the surface is covered with a mixture of rutile and anatase oxides; and (4) a similar trend was found on Ti-6Al-4V and TiNi surfaces.","Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Dent Mat Div, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; Kangbuk Samsung Hosp Dent Ctr, Dept Prosthodont, Seoul, South Korea; Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Grad Prosthodont Program, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Oshida, Y (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Dent Mat Div, 1121 W Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",yoshida@iupui.edu,,,,,,44,85,93,0,23,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

The rational of conducting this investigation is to further elucidate the mechanisms of tissue-implant interaction, Thirteen Sprague-Dawley adult male albino rats were randomly divided into three groups. Animals in groups I and II (n = 5/group) were implanted at both ip and sc implantation sites with either ALCAP or TCP ceramics, respectively. Animals in group III (n = 3) were not implanted and served as the intact control for the comparative purposes. At 90 days postimplantation, the animals in all groups were euthanized (Ketamine/Zylazane) and the fibrous tissue surrounding the ceramic devices was retrieved. After routine histological processing, sections (5 mum) of tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated using light microscopy. With the exception of neutrophils, at both implantation sites, the fibrous tissues surrounding the TCP bioceramics demonstrated greater capsular thickness, more vascularity, and more macrophages, fibroblasts, and collagen than those surrounding the ALCAP ceramic. Data obtained from this investigation provided further insights into the differences in the tissue-implant responses of calcium-phosphate-based ceramics and the cellular composition of the fibrous tissue reaction found at sc and ip implantation sites.","Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Sch Hlth Related Profess, Dept Hlth Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Jackson, MS 39216 USA","Benghuzzi, HA (reprint author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Sch Hlth Related Profess, Dept Hlth Sci, 2500 N State St, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.",,,,,,,32,14,14,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1939,,,J INVEST SURG,J.

The effect on gingival tissue of various crown materials in combination with different abutment biomaterials should be investigated. Purpose. This in vivo study determined the gingival health and subgingival levels of periodontal inflammation-associated bacteria adjacent to various crown and abutment material combinations. Material and methods. Patients in the study received 1 of 5 treatments: an all-ceramic crown luted to a natural tooth, a metal-ceramic (titanium) crown luted to natural tooth, a metal-ceramic thigh noble alloy) crown luted to natural tooth, an all-ceramic crown luted to a titanium implant abutment, or a metal-ceramic thigh noble alloy) crown luted to a titanium implant abutment. Plaque was collected at least 6 months after luting by paper point from the gingival sulcus of each crown and an adjacent unrestored (control) tooth. DNA. probe analysis was performed to determine the levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, plaque, gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding scores were recorded with use of the California Dental Association scale. Statistical analysis was used to determine the effect of restoration/abutment type on levels of the bacterial species and clinical parameters pertaining to gingival health. Results. None of the sulci sampled contained detectable levels of the 3 bacteria. Plaque levels and gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding scores were low All treatment groups had similar soft tissue response as measured by gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding. Plaque scores from all-ceramic crown/implant abutment sites were higher than plaque scores from all-ceramic crown/natural tooth sites. However, differences between experimental and control sites within the same treatment group were not observed (P>.05) with any of the 4 clinical measures. Conclusion. In patients with suitable oral hygiene, tooth-supported and implant-supported crowns with intracrevicular margins were not predisposed to unfavorable gingival and microbial responses.","Univ Nebraska, Med Ctr, Coll Dent, Dept Oral Biol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Dent, Dept Occlus, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; Univ Michigan, Dept Prosthodont, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Koka, S (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Med Ctr, Coll Dent, Dept Oral Biol, 40th & Holdrege St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",skoka@unmc.edu,,,,,,30,19,23,0,3,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-3913,1097-6841,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

Studies have found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) attaches to and is eluted from dental alloys, but the biologic effects of LPS are not known. Purpose. This study evaluated the ability of dental casting alloys pre-exposed to LPS to activate human monocytes with and without subsequent elution of the LPS. Material and methods. Eight types of casting alloys (n = 6 specimens per type) were exposed to LPS (Escherichia coli @ 100 mug/mL) for 24 hours. Controls were not exposed to LPS. Teflon (Tf) (+/- LPS) served as the material control. Treated alloys were transferred to THP-1 human monocytes for 24 hours or placed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 120 hours before monocyte exposure. Monocyte activation was assessed by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion into the medium. Alloys without LPS, with LPS but without PBS elution, and with LPS and elution were compared with ANOVA and Tukey intervals (alpha=.05). Results. Specimens without LPS exposure but with elution caused no detectable TNF-alpha secretion from monocytes. Specimens without elution into PBS caused low-to-moderate TNF-alpha secretion, indicating a possible false-positive result from the alloy conditioning solution used. After LPS exposure but no elution, high levels of TNF-alpha were found. When alloys were eluted for 120 hours after LPS exposure, there was no detectable TNF-alpha released. Conclusion. In this in vitro system as in past studies, LPS appeared to adhere to and elute from the alloys. Monocytes were activated initially but not after elution into PBS for 120 hours. Alloy conditioning solutions may also have an artifactual effect on cytokine release.","Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA","Nelson, SK (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,33,2,3,0,1,"MOSBY, INC",ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",0022-3913,,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

The surface characterization and biological performance of these materials are described. This modification strategy is performed by reversible gelation of the PLA surface following exposure to a solvent/nonsolvent mixture. PEG is then able to diffuse into the swollen surface region, before it is collapsed by the addition of more nonsolvent. This results in the localized physical entrapment of the diffused material. We have demonstrated by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that control over the PEG surface density may be achieved by using predetermined process conditions, such as a particular solvent/nonsolvent ratio or a set polymer treatment time, and that surface coverage of around 75% is possible. Cell adhesion studies have shown that even in serum-containing media PEG entrapment will prevent attachment, with a 95% reduction in cell number compared to unmodified PLA. This modification strategy was also used to coentrap both PEG and poly(L-lysine)-RGD within the PLA surface region. The attachment of cells to this material shows that the entrapment approach may be used to create highly selective biomaterial surfaces that are able to prevent unwanted cell or protein adhesion yet actively promote specific cellular interaction.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Shakesheff, Kevin/O-6371-2018; Chan, Weng/O-2045-2015","Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Chan, Weng/0000-0002-0488-825X; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,24,55,59,1,16,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,2001.0,17,9,,,,,2817,2820,,10.1021/la001509a,,,,4,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,426XD,WOS:000168373000043,,,,,2019-02-25

Mixed SAMs formed from a 1:1 combination of a thiol terminated in a trimethylammonium group and a thiol terminated in a sulfonate group adsorbed less than 1% of a monolayer of two proteins with different characteristics: fibrinogen and lysozyme. Single-component SAMs formed from thiols terminating in groups combining a positively charged moiety and a negatively charged moiety were also capable of resisting the adsorption of proteins. Single-component SAMs presenting single charges adsorbed nearly a full monolayer of protein. The amount of protein that adsorbed to mixed zwitterionic SAMs did not depend on the ionic strength or the pH of the buffer in which the protein was dissolved. The amount of protein that adsorbed to single-component zwitterionic SAMs increased as the ionic strength of the buffer decreased; it also decreased as the pH of the buffer increased (at constant ionic strength). Single-component zwitterionic SAMs composed of thiols terminating in N,N-dimethyl-amino-propane-1-sulfonic acid (-N+(CH3)(2)CH2CH2CH2SO3-) groups were substantially more effective at resisting adsorption of fibrinogen and lysozyme from buffer at physiological ionic strength and pH than single-component zwitterionic SAMs composed of thiols terminating in phosphoric acid 2-trimethylamino-ethyl ester (-OP(O)(2)-OCH2CH2N+(CH3)(3)). Several of these zwitterionic SAMs were comparable to the best known systems for resisting nonspecific adsorption of protein.","Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Whitesides, GM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Chen, Xiaoxi/0000-0002-1049-3537",,,,46,530,541,6,188,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAY 1,2001.0,17,9,,,,,2841,2850,,10.1021/la0015258,,,,10,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,426XD,WOS:000168373000047,,,,,2019-02-25

Simulating harbour dredging in an experiment using suspended sediment from one of the harbours only resulted in a low concentration of TBT in the tissues of the common whelk and subsequently no changes in the occurrence and degree of imposer. The common whelk seemed to receive the main part of TBT from the water column and the limited bioaccumulation in the experiment indicates that desorption of TBT from the suspended sediment was slow. After TBT has been totally banned, dredging of contaminated sediments will cause increased exposure of the biota to TBT, Due to slow desorption the increase may however, be slight and temporary to pelagic and epibenthic species unless the settled particles are resuspended, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.","Univ Iceland, Inst Biol, IS-108 Reykjavik, Iceland; Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; CNRS, EP132, LCBIE, F-6405 Pau, France","Svavarsson, J (reprint author), Univ Iceland, Inst Biol, Grensasvegur 12, IS-108 Reykjavik, Iceland.",jorundur@hi.is,,,,,,33,19,22,1,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0025-326X,1879-3363,,MAR POLLUT BULL,Mar.

Objective:We report the development of a new peritoneal dialysis catheter. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate tissue response to this catheter. . Design: In our catheter design, the catheter's cuffs are made from sintered titanium fiber mesh instead of the common Dacron material. The catheters were implanted in goats. During the study period, the catheter exit sites were observed once every 2 weeks. After 14 weeks, the catheters and surrounding tissues were processed for histology and analyzed. . Results:We observed that catheters with titanium cuffs performed significantly better, compared with a commercial catheter design. Histology showed that titanium fibers evoked a lesser inflammatory response compared with Dacron fibers. In addition, the capsule surrounding the titanium cuff was significantly thinner. . Conclusions: Supported by the obtained results, we conclude that the use of Dacron velour for anchorage of percutaneous catheters has to be reconsidered.

As a result, new technologies developed using these properties of surfaces, creating wealth, new scientific knowledge, and the need for new surface instrumentation with ever increasing time resolution. spatial and energy resolution. Over 60 techniques have been developed, most recently, those that can scrutinize, on the molecular level, the buried interfaces, solid-high pressure gas, solid-liquid, and solid-solid. The surface may be treated as a separate phase with different structure, composition and electronic properties. The new concepts of molecular surface science that were discovered include clean surface reconstruction, adsorbate induced restructuring, the high mobility of surface atoms at high pressures, and the unique importance of surface defects in controlling surface phenomena ranging From adsorption to heterogeneous catalysis. Future directions include studies of electrode surface under external potential conditions. polymer surfaces. studies of biomaterials. and studies of nanoclusters produced by chemical means or by electron beam lithography.

It makes optical surface sensing systems very reasonable and promising tools for its monitoring and study. We evaluated the feasibility to follow the enzymatic conversion of surface-bound fibrinogen by thrombin to fibrin monomer and possible complex formation between surface-bound fibrin monomer and fibrinogen in solution using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. For the investigations of optical properties of immobilised molecular layers, the Kretschmann geometry of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method was utilised. Density of fibrinogen bound to the surface depended on the concentration of fibrinogen in solution during the adsorption process. A fibrinogen monolayer was always formed. Fibrinogen in solution did not bind to surface-bound fibrinogen. Bound fibrinogen converted by thrombin to fibrin monomer interacted (rather slowly) with fibrinogen in solution. The rate of adsorption depended upon immobilised fibrin monomer density, fibrinogen concentration in solution, and on the presence of calcium ions. At low fibrin monomer density, the second layer was formed that contained about the same amount of protein as the first layer, at higher fibrin monomer concentration less than one molecule of fibrinogen per molecule of fibrin monomer was captured.

Here we demonstrate that the rate of tissue spreading over a two-dimensional substratum reflects a competition or ""tug-of-war"" between cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesions. We have generated both a ""library"" of structurally related copolymeric substrata varying in their adhesivity to cells and a library of genetically engineered cell populations varying only in cohesivity. Cell-substratum adhesivity was varied through the poly(ethylene glycol) content of a series of copolymeric substrata, whereas cell-cell cohesivity was varied through the expression of the hemophilic cohesion molecules Nand R-cadherin by otherwise noncohesive L929 cells. In the key experiment, multicellular aggregates containing about 600 cells were allowed to spread onto copolymeric surfaces. We compared the spreading behavior of aggregates having different levels of cell-cell cohesivity on a series of copolymeric substrata having different levers of cell-substratum adhesivity. In these experiments, cell-cell cohesivity was measured by tissue surface tensiometry, and cell-substratum adhesivity was assessed by a distractive method. Tissue spreading was assayed by confocal microscopy as the rate of cell emigration from similar-sized, fluorescence-labeled, multicellular aggregates deposited on each of the substrata. We demonstrate that either decreasing substratum adhesivity or increasing cell-cell cohesivity dramatically slowed the spreading rate of cell aggregates.","Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Steinberg, MS (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",msteinberg@princeton.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [HD30345]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM39455],,,38,156,158,0,19,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The current in vitro study was designed to investigate such a feasibility on a collagen-coated heparin-bonded graft and to evaluate cell detachment upon pulsatile shear stress. Materials and methods: Endothelial cells (EA-hy-926) were seeded onto grafts. The endothelialization of the grafts was evaluated by the [H-3]-thymidine incorporation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological examinations. After in situ EC radiolabeling with a novel Tc-99m technique, the prostheses were exposed to pulsatile shear stress (0.27 N/m(2)), mimicking the shear rate occurring in a superficial femoral artery, for 3 h in a flow circuit and EC loss quantified by gamma camera detection. Results: Complete EC coverage was achieved after 5 days. Three hours of artificial perfusion resulted in a low EC loss (12.9 +/- 0.8 %, n = 7). SEM shows EC withstanding shear stress in valleys of prosthesis circumvolutions. Conclusions: These satisfactory results could be explained by the high affinity of EC For heparinized surfaces in addition to cell surface receptors involved in adhesion to collagen.

The water adsorption and desorption characteristics of these polymers were measured in water and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The desorption diffusion coefficients were higher than the adsorption coefficients in both water and PBS. Linear relationships between the equilibrium mass of water taken up and the mass of water desorbed with the concentration of HEMA in the polymer were established. Polymer surfaces were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface features varied with polymer composition; during hydration only selective areas of the surface hydrated indicating a heterogeneous surface. Contact angle data showed no trend between the different polymers indicating that contact angles are not an acceptable method of assessing hydrophobicity/wettability of a material which does not have a homogeneous surface. The effect of these bulk and surface characteristics on biological interactions were examined using bovine chondrocytes and human osteoblast (HOB) cell cultures. Cell attachment decreased when HEMA was present in the copolymer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Air-dried films were submitted to treatment with GTA solutions at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 wt%. At the smallest GTA concentration, the crosslinking degree, determined by trinitrobenzensulfonic acid assay, amounts to about 60% and increases up to values near 100%, obtained with GTA concentrations greater than or equal to 1 wt%. Simultaneously, the deformability of the films decreases, whereas the stress at break, sigma (b), and the Young's modulus, E, increase. A crosslinking degree of about 85%, obtained using 0.25% GTA, is enough to prevent gelatin release in buffer solution and to provoke a significant reduction of the swelling in physiological solution. Furthermore, crosslinking greatly affects the thermal stability of the samples, as indicated by the results of differential scanning calorimetry (d.s.c.) investigation carried out on wet and air-dried films.

This has been facilitated over recent decades by the development of a wide range of implants and biomedical devices to correct the functional deficiencies of disease, age and ocular trauma. This brief overview provides an insight into the structure of this unique organ, the major physiological functions of the component tissues and the present state of the art with respect to modern ocular implants. The review focuses primarily on the existing limitations of existing ocular biomaterials used in the fabrication of contact lenses, intraocular lenses, glaucoma filtration implants, keratoprostheses, intracorneal implants, scleral buckles and viscoelastic replacement agents. The challenge of improving ocular compatibility and ensuring the longevity of indwelling ocular devices is addressed along with the need to improve the physicochemical and mechanical properties of existing ocular biomaterials.

A critical barrier to their use as load-bearing tissue replacements is a lack of sufficient mechanical properties. The purpose of this study was to characterize the functional compressive and shear mechanical properties of a novel PVA hydrogel. Two formulations of the biomaterial were tested, one with a lower water content (75% water), and the other with higher water content (80% water). The compressive tangent modulus varied with biomaterial formulation and was found to be statistically strain magnitude and rate dependent. Over a strain range of 10-60%, the compressive modulus increased from approximately 1-18 MPa, which is within the range of the modulus of articular cartilage. The shear tangent modulus (0.1-0.4 MPa) was also found to be strain magnitude dependent and within the range of normal human articular cartilage, but it was not statistically dependent on strain rate. This behavior was attributed to the dominance of fluid flow and related frictional drag on the viscoelastic behavior. Compressive failure of the hydrogels was found to occur between 45 and 60% strain, depending on water content.

Composites were prepared by hot pressing mixtures of these powders at 80 kpsi and 300 degreesC for 30 min. Composite formation was investigated depending on the proportions of reactants and the processing route used. Two inorganic phases were produced as a result of the acid-base reaction between TetCP and PVPA: hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2), HAp) and anhydrous dicalcium phosphate (CaHPO4, DCPA). The later phase preferentially formed at lower TetCP/PVPA ratios while the amount of HAp increased with increasing TetCP/PVPA ratio. The reactions appear to start with the softening of the polymer when heated to T > T-g. The flowing polymer surrounds the TetCP grains permitting the TetCP to initially form DCPA crystallites in a matrix of the Ca salt of the polymer. When H2O is added prior to pressing, the DCPA produced reacts with the remaining TetCP forming HAp. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the present study the adhesion, viability and apoptotic changes in material surface adherent monocytes during the first hours of cell-surface interactions in vitro were studied, using tissue culture polystyrene surfaces coated with human albumin and fibrinogen. Human peripheral blood monocytes were enriched by a two-step gradient centrifugation and resuspended (1 x 10(6)/ml) in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were added to polystyrene surfaces coated with human fibrinogen or albumin and incubated in 37 degreesC (5% CO2, 100% humidity) for 30 min, 1, 2, 3 and 24 h. The adherent cells were stained for early apoptotic changes (exposed phosphatidylserine) and cell death using Annexin-V-fluorescein and propidium iodide staining, respectively. A bi-phasic adhesion was observed on the fibrinogen coated surface, having the highest number of adherent cells after 30 min and 24 h, while the cell number was markedly reduced after 1-3 h. The number of adherent cells on albumin was relatively low after all short time incubations but had reached a high level after 24 h. The number of adherent dead cells was highest after 1 h on both albumin (similar to 30%) and fibrinogen (similar to 15%). In the 24 h cultures, the viability of adherent cells was high on both surfaces (95-100%). Viable cells staining positive for early apoptotic changes could only be clearly observed on the albumin coated surface, after 30 min of cell-material surface interaction. Cell death, including apoptotic death, thus seems to play an important role during the initial interactions between monocytes and a foreign surface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We demonstrate a met hod to overcome this problem, by attaching the peptide to poly(L-lysine) (PLL), which immobilizes the sequence through adsorption at the poly(alpha -hydroxyacid) surface. When coated using a 0.01% w/v solution of PLL-GRGDS, bovine aortic endothelial cells seeded upon the modified PLA showed a marked increase in spreading over unmodified PLA. However, inhibition of the cell-spreading effect occurred when using higher concentrations of PLL-GRGDS, which we attribute to the PLL component. This inhibitory effect can be challenged by increasing the amount of GRGDS attached to each PLL molecule. Potentially, this is a flexible method of surface modification that can engineer many different types of tissue engineering scaffolds with a variety of biomolecules, thus allowing initial cell adhesion to be controlled.

The scaffold plays a central role in the creation of 3-D structures in cardiovascular tissue engineering like small vessels or heart valve prosthesis. An ideal scaffold should have tissue-like mechanical properties and a complete immunologic integrity. As an alternative scaffold the use of fibrin gel was investigated. Methods: Preliminary the degradation of the fibrin gel nas controlled by the supplementation of aprotinin to the culture medium. To prevent tissue from shrinking a mechanical fixation of the gel with 3-D microstructure culture plates and a chemical fixation with poly-L-lysine in different fixation techniques were studied. The thickness of the gel layer was changed from 1 to 3 mm. The tissue development was analysed by light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Collagen production was detected by the measurement of hydroxyproline. Injection molding techniques were designed for the formation of complex 3-D tissue structures. Results: The best tissue development was observed at an aprotinin concentration of 20 mug per cc culture medium. The chemical border fixation of the gel by poly-L-lysine showed the best tissue development. Up to a thickness of 3 mm no nutrition problems were observed in the light and transmission electron microscopy. The molding of a simplified valve conduit was possible by the newly developed molding technique. Conclusion: Fibrin gel combines a number of important properties of an ideal scaffold. It can be produced as a complete autologous scaffold. It is moldable and degradation is controllable by the use of aprotinin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These substitutes contained autogenetic growth stimulators including osteoblasts and other multipotential cells. One month later, they were transferred to the segmental bone defect sites created in femoral diaphysis of the same animals. The roentgenograms showed that in time the boundaries between the cylinders and bone sections became vague. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the spectra of the samples tended to be similar to those of natural bones by 6 months postoperatively. Their bending strengths also increased gradually. After the cylinders were transferred from muscles to the bone defect sites, newly formed bone tissues rapidly increased and the cylinders gradually fused with the contacted bones 2 months later. By 4 and 6 months, bone tissue occupied most areas of the materials. The ratio of newly formed bone tissue had a large lead over the materials. Haversian systems were clearly observed and matured bone tissues filled the ceramic pores and connected with each other. Results suggested that culturing complexes that consist of autogenetic periostea and biomaterials, taking advantage of living organic culturing medium, should be an effective approach to get satisfactory bioactive bone substitutes. It also provides a basis for clinically repairing bone defects in bearing sites with complex bioceramics.

Most of the biomaterials tested did not induce significant cytotoxic effects and exhibited normal metabolic function and cell growth in vitro.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that adhesion in anchorage-dependent cells is mediated in vitro by adsorption of serum proteins [particularly proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin and vitronectin] present in the growth medium. Specifically, adhesion has been shown to occur hen ECM proteins attach to the substratum and act as ligands for specific receptors located on the surface of cells. K562 cells are human erythroleukemic cells that normally grow in suspension. These cells are not involved in the same cell adhesion processes as anchorage-dependent cells and do not need to be attached to ECM proteins in order to survive and grow. Thus, with these systems, it is possible to better determine the role of protein adsorption in the adhesion of cells, growing in suspension such as blood cells, onto charged surfaces. The results presented show that adhesion of K562 cells onto the positively charged polylysine surface in the presence of serum is mediated through specific interactions between fibronectin receptors present on K562 cells and fibronectin adsorbed onto that cationic surface. Specifically, determination of cell adhesion under different experimental conditions indicates that nonspecific charge interactions do not take place directly between the cells and polylysine, but rather take place between polylysine and fibronectin, which adsorbs onto the cationic polymer. In addition, flow cytometric analyses reveal that only fibronectin receptors are present on these cells and, consequently, only fibronectin can be responsible for the actual adhesion of these cells onto the cationic surface. In view of the data presented, the possibility should be considered that ECM components adsorbed onto surfaces with specific charges and/or belonging to certain functional groups are involved in structural and functional modifications in cells. These cells grow in suspension and are normally not involved in adhesion phenomena, though these components should be considered. These considerations should be made especially when designing biomaterials that can modulate the response of cells growing in suspension, such as blood cells, and also in tissue engineering of blood substitutes.

This accelerated bone resorption could be due to increased osteoclastic activity, survival, or differentiation. Although a number of in vitro studies have shown that wear particles increase osteoclastic activity, the increase was less than twofold in all cases. The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that wear particles stimulate bone resorption by inducing osteoclast differentiation. Methods: Conditioned media were prepared from murine marrow cells or human peripheral blood monocytes incubated in the presence or absence of titanium particles. The effects of conditioned media on osteoclast differentiation were examined with use of a recently developed assay in which osteoclast precursors are co-cultured with mesenchymal support cells. Results: The present study showed that titanium particles induced both murine marrow cells and human peripheral blood monocytes to produce factors that stimulated osteoclast differentiation. The mean increase in osteoclast differentiation was 29.3 +/- 9.4-fold. The stimulation of osteoclast differentiation led to a parallel increase in bone resorption. The amount of stimulation was regulated in a dose-dependent manner by the concentration of both titanium particles and conditioned media. The stimulation of osteoclast differentiation required interactions between the cells and the particles themselves and, therefore, was not due to metal ions, soluble contaminants released from the particles, or submicrometer particles. In contrast, conditioned media from control cells incubated in the absence of titanium particles had no detectable effect on any of the examined parameters. Conclusions: The present study showed that titanium particles stimulate in vitro bone resorption primarily by inducing osteoclast differentiation. In contrast, the titanium particles had only small effects on osteoclast activity or survival. Clinical Relevance: The present study provides strong support for the hypothesis that osteoclast differentiation is an important factor in the development of aseptic loosening. The development of therapeutic interventions to reduce osteoclast differentiation may be a useful approach for improving the performance of orthopaedic implants.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Bi, YM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL33849]; NIAMS NIH HHS [AR43769, AR07505]",,,43,75,80,2,8,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

While numerous studies have evaluated the cellular response to particulate biomaterials, few have investigated the influence of movement of the implant on the biological response to particles. Our aim was therefore to test the hypothesis that excessive mechanical stimulation of the periprosthetic tissues induces an inflammatory response and that the addition of particulate biomaterials intensifies this. We allocated 66 adult Beagle dogs to four groups as follows: stable implants with (I) and without (II) particulate polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and moving implants with (III) and without (IV) particulate PMMA, They were then evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The stable implants were well tolerated and a thin, fibrous membrane of connective tissue was observed. There was evidence of positive staining in some cells for interleukin-6 (IL-6), Addition of particulate PMMA around the stable implants resulted in an increase in the fibroblastic response and positive staining for IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). By contrast, movement of the implant resulted in an immediate inflammatory response characterised by large numbers of histiocytes and cytokine staining for IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6, Introduction of particulate PMMA aggravated this response. Animals with particulate PMMA and movement of the implant have an intense inflammatory response associated with accelerated bone loss. Our results indicate that the initiation of the inflammatory response to biomaterial particles was much slower than that to gross mechanical instability. Furthermore, when there was both particulate debris and movement, there was an amplification of the adverse tissue response as evidenced by the presence of osteolysis and increases in the presence of inflammatory cells and their associated cytokines.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Baltimore, MD 21239 USA","Jones, LC (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Suite 201,Good Samaritan Profess Bldg, Baltimore, MD 21239 USA.",,,,NIEHS NIH HHS [ES 07141],,,78,34,35,0,2,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",0301-620X,2044-5377,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

However, tumor cells profoundly differ from normal tissue cells and monocytes are only precursors of macrophages. It has become possible to generate recently, under adherent-free conditions, fully mature macrophages and dendritic cells from human blood monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and GM-CSF + IL4 respectively. In the present work, we examined the effects of titanium-alloy on morphology, adhesion, cell phenotype and TNF-alpha release activity of such differentiated cells grown in hydrophobic teflon bags. Scanning electron microscopy showed that macrophages substantially adhered and spread on titanium-alloy surface throughout the culture period, whereas only a few dendritic cells were adherent. The phenotype of both cell types remained unchanged in the presence of the tested material. However, titanium-alloy stimulated the secretion of TNF-alpha by the macrophages of some donors. This model of culture may offer new insights into the biomaterial evaluation and may be useful for studying individual responses induced by biomaterials.

The same cells cultured on tissue culture-treated polystyrene without biomaterials were tested as the negative control; the same cells incubated with LPS were the positive control. The level of IL-6 in the conditioned medium was tested by enzyme immunoassay; the mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR with specific primers. The cultures incubated with C-PET produced non significantly different amount of IL-6 compared to the negative control and did not induce the expression of IL-6 specific mRNA. LPS induced a significantly higher release of IL-6 in the medium and the expression of mRNA after 24, 48 and 72 h.

Our composites are produced with different amounts (10 to 50% by weight) of the reinforcement by two procedures: bi-axial rotating drum and twin screw extrusion (TSE). The processing is by conventional injection molding and by Scorim (shear controlled orientation in injection molding) under a wide range of processing windows. Tensile testing is performed and the corresponding performance related to the morphology evaluated by polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The control of the processing parameters led to significant improvements of the tensile properties. Compounding by TSE and then processing by Scorim produces the maximum modulus of 7.4 GPa and the ductility as high as 19%, for the HA weight fraction of 30%. These mechanical properties match those of bone, and were obtained with much smaller amounts of HA reinforcement then has been previously reported in literature. Our PE + HA composites present the additional benefit of being ductile even for 50% HA amounts. The use Scorim is a unique way of inducing anisotropy to thick sections and to produce very stiff composites that may be used in biomedical applications with important mechanical loads.

From a therapeutic perspective, a carrier matrix is required for the local delivery of these proteins to evoke a desired osteogenic effect. In view of the affinity of these proteins for hydroxyapatite, which may reflect the in vivo supramolecular assembly of bone proteins bound to both the extracellular matrix and the mineral component of bone, we investigated the efficacy of single applications of different doses of human osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1) adsorbed onto sintered porous hydroxyapatites for bone induction in orthotopic calvarial defects in 12 adult male baboons (Papio ursinus) and heterotopically in the rectus abdominis of four additional baboons. In orthotopic specimens, pretreatment of sintered porous hydroxyapatites with 100 mug of hOP-1 in 500 mul of 5 mM hydrochloric acid resulted in rapid and diffuse osteoinduction restricted within the porous spaces of the hydroxyapatite, as evaluated by histology and histomorphometry on day 30. Hydroxyapatites treated with 500 mug of hOP-1 showed a different pattern of bone formation and distribution on day 30 as compared with the lower dose of the recombinant morphogen. Although bone formation was extensive with the higher dose, it was found on the endocranial and pericranial aspects of the specimens, enveloping the implanted hydroxyapatite carrier, and the internal porous spaces were occupied by a rich vascular network without any bone formation. By 90 and 365 days after the implantation of both doses of hOP-1, however, there was remodelling and complete penetration of the newly induced bone within the available porous spaces. The combination of hOP-1 and hydroxyapatite also showed extensive bone formation in heterotopic specimens harvested from the rectus abdominis muscle of the baboon using doses of 5, 25, and 45 mug of hOP-1 per implant. These findings in the adult primate demonstrate extensive bone formation by hOP-1 adsorbed onto sintered porous hydroxyapatites and suggest that predictable osteogenesis in clinical contexts for treatment of craniofacial bone defects may be engineered using inorganic, nonimmunogenic, and carvable delivery systems that initiate osteogenesis with relatively low doses of recombinant osteogenic proteins, thus mimicking the macrostructure and microstructure of living bone.","Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Med, MRC, Bone Res Unit, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa; Stryker Bitoech, Johannesburg, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Med, MRC, Bone Res Unit, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,53,58,60,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0032-1052,,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

Material and methods: We designed a randomized, double-blinded, prospective study in order to verify the impact of a new surface modification [SMAR(X)T] in combination with an optimized blood air interface, on the cerebral performance after cardiopulmonary bypass. 80 patients were randomly divided into two subgroups (SMARxT vs. standard PVC control) and analyzed for the kinetic of cerebral ischemia markers neuronspecific enolase, protein S100 and neuropsychologically tested with the Mini-Mental-Status Test (MMST) before and after the operation. Results: We could not show significant differences of protein S100 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels between SMAR(X)T patients and the controls, but the incidence of neurological complications was exceptionally low. Although no statistically significant differences could be obtained for the MMST, the different pointloss between both groups trends toward a better cerebral performance in SMAR(X)T patients. Conclusion: The use of a biologically inert circuit in combination with an optimized perfusion management seems to be worthy of recommendation.","Herzzentrum Ludwigshafen, Klin Herzchirurg, D-67063 Ludwigshafen, Germany","Isgro, F (reprint author), Herzzentrum Ludwigshafen, Klin Herzchirurg, Bremserstr 73, D-67063 Ludwigshafen, Germany.",,,,,,,23,4,4,0,1,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0171-6425,,,THORAC CARDIOV SURG,Thorac.

Two landmark studies have shown that stainless steel stents significantly decrease the restenosis rate as compared to balloon angioplasty. This fact led to a marked increase of stent implantation since the first stent implantation by Jacques Fuel in 1986. Although the concept of coronary stenting significantly improved the interventional therapy of coronary artery disease, restenosis remains a major unsolved drawback of this technique. In addition to procedure and disease related factors like implantation pressure and plaque burden, data suggest that the stent as a medical implant plays a crucial role in the process of neointima formation. Since its introduction in cardiology, more than 50 different stents of different configuration and material have been developed. Although recent publications report of promising results using biodegradable materials, almost all coronary stents commercially available at the moment are made of metallic alloys. Whereas first generation stents were made exclusively from stainless steel and only minor interest was focussed on the stent material in the manufacture of coronary stents, recent studies strongly suggest that the metallic alloy used has a direct impact on the extent of neointima formation. Thus, metallic alloys differ not only with respect to mechanical features, but also by their biocompatible properties. These two factors are of major importance in the induction of vessel wall injury, inflammatory processes and cell proliferation. In the first part, the present paper reviews the metallurgic characteristics of metallic materials, which are currently used or under investigation in the production of coronary stents. In the second part, clinical and experimental results are summarized with respect to their biocompatibility and impact on the process of restenosis formation.","Univ Essen, D-45117 Essen, Germany; Klinikum Univ Essen, D-45122 Essen, Germany","Fischer, A (reprint author), Univ Essen, Univ Str 15, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,61,3,4,0,12,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,DARMSTADT,"PLATZ DER DEUTSCHEN EINHEIT 25, D-64293 DARMSTADT, GERMANY",0300-5860,,,Z KARDIOL,Z.

There are basically two groups of polyesters which have significant importance in this field. These are polylactides and polyhydroxybutyrates. Both groups degrade via hydrolysis with the rates of degradation depending on medium properties such as pH, temperature, solvent and presence of biocatalysts, as well as on chemical compositions. In order for these biomaterials to be suitable for use in load bearing applications without deformation or warping their strengths and their capability to maintain their form must be improved. To insure dimensional stability during degradation and to match modulus and strength to that of bone, introduction of a reinforcing structure for those applications to plate fixation through the creation of an interpenetrating network might be a feasible approach. In this study, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), was the major structural element to be strengthened by a three-dimensional network or 'scaffold' of another biodegradable polymer, poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF). PPF would be crosslinked with a biocompatible vinyl monomer, vinylpyrrolidone (VP). Three different approaches were tested to create dimensionally stable bone plates. First, via in situ crosslinking of PPF in the presence of PLGA. Secondly, by blending of precrosslinked PPF with PLGA. Finally, by simultaneous crosslinking and molding of the PLGA, PPF and VP. These were compared against extruded or compression molded PLGA controls. Results showed that compression molding at room temperature followed by crosslinking under pressure at elevated temperature and subsequently by gamma -irradiation appeared to yield the most favorable product as judged by swelling, hardness and flexural strength data. The composition of the implant material, PLGA(3):PPF(1):VP(0.7), appeared to be suitable and formed the compositional and procedural basis for in vivo biocompatibility studies.

To explore the possibility of fabricating novel two-dimensional protein layers, we studied the self-assembly properties of de novo proteins from a designed combinatorial library. Each protein in the library has a distinct 63 amino acid sequence, yet they all share an identical binary pattern of polar and nonpolar residues, which was designed to favor the formation of six-stranded amphiphilic beta -sheets, Characterization of proteins isolated from the library demonstrates that (i) they self assemble into monolayers at an air/water interface; (ii) the monolayers are dominated by beta -sheet secondary structure, as shown by both circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopies; and (iii) the measured areas (500- 600 Angstrom (2)) Of individual protein molecules in the monolayers match those expected for proteins folded into amphiphilic beta -sheets, The finding that similar structures are formed by distinctly different protein sequences suggests that assembly into beta -sheet monolayers can be encoded by binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids. Moreover, because the designed binary pattern is compatible with a wide variety of different sequences, it may be possible to fabricate beta -sheet monolayers by using combinations of side chains that are explicitly designed to favor particular applications of novel biomaterials.","Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Groves, JT (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,31,77,77,1,19,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Its use has been shown to benefit premature infants and patients with severe respiratory distress, but a vital question concerns ventilator-induced damage to the lung tissue, and a clear protocol for the most effective treatment has not been identified. Mathematical modeling can help in understanding the mechanical effects of lung ventilation, and hence in establishing such a protocol. In this paper we describe the use of homogenization theory to predict the macroscopic behavior of lung tissue based upon the three dimensional microstructure of respiratory regions, making the simplifying assumption that the microstructure is periodic. This approach yields equations for macroscopic air ow, pressure, and tissue deformation, with parameters which can be determined from a specification of the tissue microstructure and its material properties. We are able to include an alternative hypothesis as to the dependence of lung tissue shear viscosity on the frequency of forcing, known as the structural damping hypothesis. We then show how, if we consider isotropic tissue, the parameters determining the macroscopic response of the tissue can be estimated from bulk measurements. Finally, we consider the solutions of the macroscopic system when we consider variations in just one spatial dimension. In particular, we demonstrate that the structural damping hypothesis leads to markedly different solution behavior.","Univ Utah, Dept Math, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Owen, MR (reprint author), Univ Loughborough, Dept Math Sci, Nonlinear & Complex Syst Grp, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",,"Lewis, Mark/A-2659-2014; Lewis, Mark/C-5015-2008; Owen, Markus/F-3082-2011","Owen, Markus/0000-0002-3028-9138",,,,24,19,19,0,3,SIAM PUBLICATIONS,PHILADELPHIA,"3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA",0036-1399,,,SIAM J APPL MATH,SIAM J.

This process results in the formation of a nanoporous sponge composed almost entirely of the more noble alloy constituents(1). Although considerable attention has been devoted to the morphological aspects of the dealloying process, its underlying physical mechanism has remained unclear(2). Here we propose a continuum model that is fully consistent with experiments and theoretical simulations of alloy dissolution, and demonstrate that nanoporosity in metals is due to an intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process. That is, pores form because the more noble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters by a phase separation process (spinodal decomposition) at the solid-electrolyte interface, and the surface area continuously increases owing to etching. Together, these processes evolve porosity with a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum model. We expect that chemically tailored nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au should be suitable for sensor applications, particularly in a biomaterials context.","Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Northeastern Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Arizona State Univ, Ctr Solid State Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Erlebacher, J (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,"Erlebacher, Jonah/A-3231-2010; Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/C-5716-2011","Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/0000-0003-3528-3824",,,,25,1640,1670,56,871,MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,MAR 22,2001.0,410,6827,,,,,450,453,,10.1038/35068529,,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,412YX,WOS:000167583800036,11260708.0,,,,2019-02-25

It was found that the flexibility and degradability of the cast films of the block copolymers grew with increasing Pluronic(R) F68 [PN; poly(oxyethylene-co-oxypropylene] composition. The receding contact angle of the copolymer films against water became lower than that of the PLLA film, because the surface was predominantly covered with more hydrophilic PN segments in a wet state. This surface property significantly affects the cell attachment property of the copolymer films, and the fibroblasts cultured on the films exhibit a spheroid like morphology. The copolymer films subcutaneously implanted in the back of rats induced milder tissue responses compared with PLLA homopolymers, because of the increased surface hydrophilicity in the former. In vivo evaluation using a uterus horn model in rats revealed that the performance of these copolymer films as an adhesion-prevention membrane is comparable to that of a conventionally utilized membrane of oxidized regenerated cellulose. These results indicate that the copolymer films are biocompatible materials with controllable mechanical properties and biodegradability as adhesion-prevention membranes.

However, difficulties are frequently encountered in characterizing the adsorbed layer due to conformational changes in the molecules following adsorption al td interference from nonspecifically adsorbed molecules. In this study, we have investigated a technique for covalently immobilizing fibronectin to the PEG-containing triblock copolymer Pluronic(TM) F108 (""F108""). We have compared this technique to solution adsorption of fibronectin for its ability to provide controlled variation of bound fibronectin and regulation of fibroblast behavior. Both simple adsorption and covalent immobilization were effective for varying substrate-bound fibronectin. However, adsorption of fibronectin did not effectively regulate fibroblast attachment or spreading in either serum-free or serum-containing media. Fibroblast attachment, spreading, cytoskeletal organization, and proliferation were effectively regulated in response to fibronectin immobilized to F108. Furthermore, F108-treated surfaces without immobilized fibronectin did not support nonspecific fibroblast attachment, even in the presence of serum-containing medium. Fibroblasts were observed to only proliferate on surfaces with high levels of immobilized fibronectin that supported extensive cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization. In summary, covalent immobilization of fibronectin to F108 provided controlled regulation of fibroblast behavior without interference from nonspecific protein adsorption, even in the presence of serum-containing medium.

In addition, the differences in the surface topography (in a nanometer scale) of different fibers with respect to their in vitro bioactivity were studied. The structure of the fibers was varied using three different factors: (1) spinnable sols having varying structures and sizes of silica polymers to establish varying viscosity levels; (2) aging of green-state fibers; and (3) heat treatment of fibers. The in vitro bioactivity and solubility tests were done in simulated body fluid (SBF). To monitor surface topography and roughness of the heat-treated silica fibers, a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with tapping mode AFM was used. Different fibers obtained clearly different properties.

It was found that surface structure in a nanometer scale was the most important factor controlling the in vitro bioactivity of heat-treated silica fibers. The correct proportions between the peaks and peak distances at the surfaces are suggested to be important with respect to in vitro bioactivity. The results indicate that peak distance distribution between 5-50 nm, especially between 5-20 nm, together with a peak height greater than or equal to1 nm is most favorable for calcium phosphate formation.

The aim was to generate compounds having lowest toxicity for determining the pharmacological structure-function relationships among different backbone structures and differently arranged functional groups compared to those of heparin and heparan sulfate. The water-soluble starting material, chitosan, with a degree of acetylation (DA) of 0.14 and a molecular weight of 29 kD, allows one to apply most of the known reactions of chitosan as well as some reactions of heparin chemistry successfully and with improved regioselectivity and completeness. On the other hand, a number of these reactions were not successful by application to water-soluble high-molecular-weight chitosan (DA 0.45 and 150 kD). The starting material showed statistical N-acetyl (N-Ac) distribution along the polymer chain according to the rules of Bernoulli, with highest abundance of the GlcNAc-GlcNAc diad along with a lower abundance of triads, tetrads, and pentads. The space between the N-Ac groups was filled up in homogeneous reactions by N-sulfo and/or N-carboxymethyl groups, which also resulted in a Bernoulli statistical distribution. The N-substitution reaction showed highest regioselectivity and completeness with up to three combined different functional groups. The regioselectivity of the 3-O-sulfo groups was improved by regioselective 6-desulfation of nearly completely sulfated 3,6-di-O-sulfochitosan. By means of desulfation reactions, all of the possible intermediate sulfated products are possible. 6-O-Sulfo groups can also be introduced with highest regioselectivity and completeness, and a number of partially 6-desulfated products are possible.

Western blotting is one of the options to characterize protein expression in cell populations. Method transfer to biomaterial model systems is not trivial because of the structure that exists in many biomaterials, preventing the collection of cell lysate by mechanical means. In this technical resort, we describe the influence of different protein collection methods in a model system for cell-biomaterial interactions, consisting of endothelial cells exposed to different stimuli. In particular, the influence of trypsinization before lysis, and handling complexity were determined. The results of this study indicate that many changes in proteins occur because of the intermediate enzymatic treatment, despite the use of ice-cold solutions and protease and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors throughout the procedure. Protein degradation and slight depressions in molecular weight were observed. The enzymatic treatment induced a changed cell status associated with detachment from the substratum. Western blotting of lysates of cells obtained through enzymatic harvest therefore can only be used with internal controls for the assessment of artifacts introduced by trypsinization, or alternative methods should be sought.

Specimens were prepared from 3 areas of retrieved headgear wires: inner-outer face-bow soldered junction, buccal segment, and projection entering the buccal tube. Specimens from as-received headgear wires that matched the brand and size of the retrieved wires were also fabricated; all specimens were then subjected to multitechnique characterization. Optical microscopy revealed extensive biofilm islands of amorphous precipitants and accumulated microcrystalline particles. Micro-multiple internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy investigation of the retrieved wire samples demonstrated the presence of a proteinaceous biofilm, the organic constituents of which were mainly amide, alcohol, and carbonate. Scanning electron microscopy and radiographic microanalysis showed that the elemental species precipitated on the material surface were mainly calcium and phosphorus, forming calcium-phosphorus precipitates with thicknesses reaching 300 mum, whereas radiograph fluorescence spectrometry provided evidence of integument calcification through identification of calcium and phosphorus peaks. The clinical implication of the aging pattern that was identified relates to the potential protective role or induction of disintegration by the biofilm adsorbed on the wire that affected the biocompatibility of the alloy. Whereas further investigation is suggested for the clarification of the effect of intraoral aging on ionic release, the results of this study emphasize the necessity for the incorporation of in vivo approaches, including retrieval analyses, in the study of the biologic performance of orthodontic materials.","Univ Manchester, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester, Lancs, England; Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Dent Mat, Athens, Greece","Eliades, T (reprint author), 57 Agnoston Hiroon St, GR-14231 Athens, Greece.",teliades@ath.forthnet.gr,"Eliades, Theodore/E-4959-2017","Eliades, Theodore/0000-0003-2313-4979; Watts, David/0000-0002-9105-2775",,,,27,13,13,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0889-5406,1097-6752,,AM J ORTHOD DENTOFAC,Am.

Cultured cells are seeded onto a three-dimensional biocompatible scaffold that will slowly degrade and resorb as the soft and hard structures grow and assimilate in vitro and/or in vivo. The 3-D scaffold provides the necessary template for cells to proliferate and maintain their differentiated state. Ultimately, it defines the overall shape of the tissue-engineered transplant. The aim of this review is to describe and discuss the scaffold materials of natural and synthetic origin that are of specific interest to tissue engineers. This review is based oil previous publications and our own experience in the use of biomaterials of natural and synthetic origin for tissue engineering applications. Biodegradable polymers which have been used for tissue engineering applications are mainly based on clinically established medical devices and implants. In the group of macromolecules of natural origin collagen, alginate, agarose, hyaluronic acid derivatives, chitosan, and fibrin glue have been used as scaffolds. Man-made polymers such as polyglycolide (PGA), polylactides (PLLA, PDLA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(dioxanone) (PDS) have been studied as matrix material to guide the differentiation and proliferation of cells into the targeted functional premature and/or mature tissue. Appropriate selection of scaffold material with respect to the targeted tissue is essential. Today, biomaterials of choice remain to be those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In spite of that, novel biomaterials should be developed specifically designed for tissue engineering applications.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Orthoped Surg, Singapore 119074, Singapore; Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn, Biomed Engn Lab, Singapore 119074, Singapore","Goh, JCH (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Orthoped Surg, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119074, Singapore.",dosgohj@nus.edu.sg,,"Hutmacher, Dietmar Werner/0000-0001-5678-2134",,,,62,156,161,1,56,ACAD MEDICINE SINGAPORE,REPUBLIC SINGAPORE,"142 NEIL RD, REPUBLIC SINGAPORE 088871, SINGAPORE",0304-4602,,,ANN ACAD MED SINGAP,Ann.

Allografts were used with or without treatment using an antibiotic containing gentamycine, lincomycine, and vancomycine. The bacterial strains tested were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, non-slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection was evaluated by counting the number of adherent bacteria on the allograft or synthetic material after rinsing and ultrasonication. Statistical analysis was achieved using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. Results showed that allografts not treated with antibiotics were highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Antibiotic treatment decreased infection. Application of antibiotic after thawing cryopreserved allografts led to a significant decrease.

The synthesis and spectroscopic data (ESCA, FTIR) for the plasma polymerized NIPAM (ppNIPAM) shows a remarkable retention of the monomer structure. The phase transition at 29 degreesC was measured by a novel AFM method. The phase transition was surprising because of the expectation that the plasma environment would destroy the specific NIPAM structure associated with the thermal responsiveness. The phase change of ppNIPAM is also responsible for the changes in the level of the meniscus when coated capillaries are placed in warm and cold water.

Combs comprised of a poly(methyl methacrylate) backbone and short poly(ethylene oxide) side chains were synthesized, and peptides were tethered to the side chain ends to create nanoscale peptide clusters. In thin films, comb polymers containing greater than or equal to 30 wt % six to nine unit PEO side chains completely resisted adhesion of a model fibroblast cell line in the presence of 7.5% serum over 24 h. These same polymers modified with RGD peptides elicited tunable cell adhesion when mixed with unmodified combs in varying proportion. A self-consistent field lattice model of the interface between comb polymer films and water predicts an organization of the top molecular layer of comb polymer with the backbone oriented parallel to the interface in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and hydrophilic side chains extended in a brushlike layer into solution.

In order to maintain mechanical integrity of the tissue, the cells must generate sufficient extracellular matrix before the scaffold is degraded. We have previously shown that materials containing cell adhesive ligands to promote or improve cell adhesion can decrease extracellular matrix production (Mann et al.. Modification of surfaces with cell adhesion peptides alters extracellular matrix deposition. Biomaterials 1999:20:2281-6). Such decreased matrix production by cells in tissue engineering scaffolds may result in tissue failure. However. we have found that TGF-beta1 can be used in scaffolds to dramatically increase matrix production. Matrix production by vascular smooth muscle cells grown on adhesive ligand-modified glass surfaces and in PEG hydrogels containing covalently bound adhesive ligands was increased in the presence of 0.04 pmol/ml (1 ng/ml) TGF-beta1, TGF-beta1 can counteract the effect of these adhesive ligands on matrix production; matrix production could be increased even above that observed in the absence of adhesive peptides. Further, TGF-beta1 covalently immobilized to PEG retained its ability to increase matrix production. Tethering TGF-beta1 to the polymer scaffold resulted in a significant increase in matrix production over the same amount of soluble TGF-beta1. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thermally triggerable liposomes were designed by entrapping CaCl2 within liposomes constructed of 90% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 10% dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. These liposomes released greater than 90% of entrapped Ca2+ when heated to 37 degreesC. A precursor fluid containing liposomes suspended in aqueous sodium alginate remained fluid for several days at room temperature but gelled rapidly when heated to 37 degreesC. as a result of Ca2+ release and formation of crosslinked Ca-alginate. Alternatively, thermally triggered Ca2+ release from liposomes was used to activate enzyme-catalyzed crosslinking of proteins to form hydrogels. A mixture of Ca-loaded liposomes, fibrinogen, and a Ca2+-dependent transglutaminase enzyme (either human recombinant FXIII or guinea pig liver transglutaminase) remained fluid indefinitely when stored at room temperature. but gelled rapidly when heated to 37 degreesC. SDS-PAGE of the reaction mixture revealed that gelation was due to enzymatic crosslinking of the alpha and gamma chains of fibrinogen, and oscillating rheometry revealed gel formation within 10 min of heating to 37 degreesC. This new approach may be useful for developing rapidly gelling injectable biomaterials that can be stored at room temperature and injected in a minimally invasive manner into a body tissue or cavity, upon which rapid solidification would occur. This versatile bioinspired strategy could be utilized for the delivery of biomaterials for tissue repair and reconstruction. and local site-directed drug delivery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The present study was intended to characterize the surface properties of a genipin-fixed biological tissue immobilized with heparin using the methods of ionic binding (the /h-i tissue) or covalent binding via multi-point attachment (the /h-m tissue) or end-point attachment (the /h-e tissue). The surface characteristics of test tissues evaluated were water contact angle, surface tension, protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, and cellular compatibility. Nonheparinized and the glutaraldehyde-fixed counterparts were used as controls. It was found that immobilization of heparin on the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues increased their hydrophilicity and surface tension and suppressed their mole ratio of adsorbed fibrinogen to adsorbed albumin and the amount of platelets adhered. Among the heparinized tissues, the /h-m tissue was more hydrophobic and had a higher mole ratio of adsorbed fibrinogen to adsorbed albumin and a greater amount of platelets adhered than the /h-i and /h-e tissues. In general, the surface characteristics of the /h-i tissue were comparable to the /h-e tissue. However, it is known that the ionically immobilized heparin may be displaced from the surface by an ion-exchange mechanism when exposed to blood. There were no significant differences in hydrophilicity, surface tension, the mole ratio of adsorbed fibrinogen to adsorbed albumin, and the amount of platelet adhesion between the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues in comparison with their respective counterparts. However, the cellular compatibility of the genipin-fixed tissues with or without heparinization was significantly superior to its glutaraldehyde-fixed counterparts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The biocomposite was implanted into Balb/c Singen mice and after 1 and 3 weeks removed from their organisms and analyzed by the FT-IR spectroscopy. After 1 week of testing in vivo the implanted sample gave a spectrum in which absorption bands arising from newly formed functional groups of amine and peptide can be seen. After 3 weeks, a spectrum with pronounced absorption bands at 3420 and 1650 cm(-1) assigned to newly generated collagen, a component of the extracellular connective-tissue matrix, was registered. Also, decrease of the intensity absorption band at 1760 cm(-1) originating from the C=O group of PLLA indicates bioresorption of the PLLA used. Analysis of the microstructure of the sample surface by scanning electron microscopy before and after implantation revealed bioresorption of the PLLA polymer phase and generation of collagen fibers at the sites of implanted bioresorptive PLLA. A mixture of autologous bone powder and HAp/PLLA biocomposite was also examined. After implantation, the same final products as in the case of HAp/PLLA composite biomaterial used alone were found.

Methods: In eight adult sheep, an infrarenal AAA was created transluminally by dilation of a short Palmaz stent. In six sheep, the aneurysm was then ruptured by overdilation of the stent with a large angioplasty balloon. Two sheep with AAAs that were not ruptured served as controls. A SIS Sandwich endograft, consisting of a Z stent frame with 5 bodies and covered inside and out with SIS, was used to exclude the ruptured and non-ruptured AAAs. Follow-up aortography was done immediately after the procedure and before sacrifice at 4, 8, or 12 weeks. Autopsy and histologic studies followed. Results: Endograft placement was successful in all eight sheep. Both ruptured and non-ruptured AAAs were successfully excluded. Three animals with AAA rupture developed hind leg paralysis due to compromise of the arterial supply to the lower spinal cord and were sacrificed 1 day after the procedure. In five animals, three with rupture and two controls, follow-up aortograms revealed no aortic stenoses and no perigraft leaks: Gross and histologic studies revealed incorporation of the endografts into the aortic wall with replacement of SIS by dense neointima that was completely endothelialized in areas where the endograft was in direct contact with the aortic wall. In central portions of the endograft, in contact with the thrombosed aneurysm, endothelialization was incomplete even at 12 weeks. Conclusion: The SIS Sandwich endografts effectively excluded simple AAAs and ruptured AAAs. They were rapidly incorporated into the aortic wall. A detailed long-term study is warranted.","Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dotter Intervent Inst, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Pavcnik, D (reprint author), Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dotter Intervent Inst, L342,3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",,,,,,,27,15,15,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0174-1551,,,CARDIOVASC INTER RAD,Cardiovasc.

A phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and two PBS/H2O2 solutions containing 50 and 150 mM of H2O2 were used to simulate the body fluids. The behaviour of the metal was monitored as a function of time by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for three weeks. After one week, the PBS/H2O2 solutions were replaced by fresh PBS solutions in order to simulate the end of the inflammatory process and recovery of the system. All the experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 37 degreesC. From the simulation of the experimental EIS spectra, it was concluded that the corrosion resistance of titanium is strongly affected by the presence of H2O2 and when the peroxide is removed, the metal displays a sharp resistance increase. Furthermore, the oxides formed in H2O2 are rougher and display higher ionic conductivities than the oxides Formed in the absence of peroxide. The study was complemented with potentiostatic experiments and scanning electron microscopy observation of the metal surfaces. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The paper specifically identifies the adhesion strength properties of diamond-like coatings and its dependence on process parameters for application to orthopaedic steels and polymer substrates. Sub-micron thickness films were deposited directly on stainless steel, cobalt chrome alloy, titanium alloy and ultra high mel. wt. polyethylene substrates. It was found from Rockwell and pull-off adhesion tests that superior adhesion is acquired for stainless steel substrates followed by cobalt chrome and titanium alloys. Adhesion strength was also shown to be inversely related to increases in deposition pressure and to increase with time up to a threshold. The maximum adhesion strength of coatings deposited on the polymer substrates was 60% of the value for stainless steel. Surface roughness was also inversely related to adhesion strength for the substrates examined. It is demonstrated that stainless steel offers a superior substrate material for the application of diamond-like thin-films where wear mechanisms and mechanical constraints are operational such as in orthopaedic articulating joint replacements.

A Western European systems engineering perspective,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,MARKAL; biomass; greenhouse gas policies,,"This paper discusses an assessment of the optimal use of biomass in Western Europe for the long term (2010-2030) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment is based on a linear programming model for the Western European energy and materials system, called MARKAL MATTER 4.2. The goal of the study was the comparison of the cost-effectiveness and the interactions between bioenergy, biomaterials and afforestation strategies in comparison to other greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies. The results suggest that the use of biomass for energy and materials applications will increase by up to 200 Mt (compared to the case with no permit price) if greenhouse gas policies are introduced. The main increase occurs in the production of transportation fuels and substitution of petrochemical feedstocks and electricity generation from waste and residues. Afforestation offers a cost-effective competing land-use strategy. The total contribution of biomass strategies is an emission reduction of up to 400 Mt CO2 equivalents (9% of 1990 emissions).

Design, materials and methods: twenty-four growing pigs were randomly divided into three groups. The infrarenal aorta was replaced by a segment of collagen-impregnated woven polyester prosthesis (low, medium and high porosity). Serum antibodies were detected by modified enzyme immunoassay using non-impregnated prosthesis as the target for the blood samples taken on experimental days 1, 10, 17, 24, 62 and 116 of the 22 pigs followed over the whole observation period. Results: significantly enhanced (p<0.05) mean Ige antibody binding against polyester was detected on experimental days 10, 17, 24 and 62 with antibody prevalences of 41%, 41%, 32% and 37%, resppectively. Antibody positive pigs were divided into early responders (n=9) and late responders (n=5) with antibody detection on lilly 10 and/or 17 vs day 62 and/or 116. No significant differences between the three different prostheses were found. The formation of specific IgG against polyester in the animals investigated demonstrates a broad individual variability.

Porcine and human cardiac valve leaflets were found to be a substrate favoring the deposition of vaterite crystals from stable supersaturated solution at pH 8.5 at 25 degreesC. The apparent order for vaterite crystallization reaction was found to be n = 1, suggesting a surface diffusion controlled mechanism. The crystallization was studied by the constant composition technique, thus making it possible for relatively large amounts of the overgrowth phase to be formed and identified exclusively as vaterite. Analysis of the initial rates of the reaction as a function of the solution supersaturation, according to the classical nucleation theory, yielded a value of 23.4 mJ m(-2) for the surface energy of the growing phase and a three-ion cluster forming the critical nucleus. A novel ""in vitro"" anticalcification process based on the treatment of porcine and human heart valves with sodium alginate has been developed. This anticalcification procedure reduced mineralization of porcine and human valves up to 53% and 45%, respectively. Kinetic analysis according to a Langmuir type adsorption isotherm lead to the calculation of an affinity constant K-aff = 19.3x10(4) mol(-1) dm(3) for the adsorption of sodium alginate to the substrate.

A useful system to evaluate the angiogenic activity and the inflammatory potency of various agents is the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo. Here we examined its response to different biomaterials. Smooth materials such as PVC or the polyurethane Tecoflex(R) either unmodified or modified by an OH- or N(CH3)(3)(+)-end group (HEMA or MAPTAC) inhibited angiogenesis and did not induce the formation of granulation tissue. The anti-angiogenic effects of PVC, Tecoflex(R) and its HEMA modification, however, were only seen at an early stage of development. In contrast, the MAPTAC modified Tecoflex(R) inhibited angiogenesis over the whole time. Rough materials, e.g. filter paper or a collagen/elastin membrane, stimulated angiogenesis and induced the formation of inflammatory tissue. Histological analysis revealed that the filter material was homogeneously populated with cells consisiting mainly of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The collagen/elastin membrane was only partially infiltrated with cells. Among those also clusters of granulocytes were present pointing to an acute inflammatory process. These data show that the angiogenic activity and inflammatory response of biomaterials strongly depend on the chemical composition and the physical structure of the material. The CAM assay appears to be a useful tool for studying biocompatibility.

Such a measurement would provide the required experimental evidence for validating the postulated theory that the accumulation of acidic hydrolytic degradation products within the interior of aliphatic polyesters is responsible for the observed accelerated degradation of this class of absorbable biomaterials. This new technique used a laser scanning confocal microscope coupled with pH sensitive fluorescent dyes like Texas Red sulfonyl chloride. The capability of optical thin sectioning of a laser confocal microscope would permit a non-destructive examination of the interior of biomaterials. Poly-p-dioxanone suture fibers (PDSII) of size 2/0 were used as the model compound for this new technique. The pH values of the unhydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed PDSII fibers were found to decrease with increasing depth from the fiber surface and reached as low as about 3.5 at 70 mum depth. The largest depth that an interior pH could be measured within absorbable biomaterials was determined by the opacity of the biomaterials, i.e. a higher depth for a less opaque material. The observed interior pH profiles were correlated to the unique morphologic structure of PDSII fibers.

Utilizing a visible light photoinitiating system, these oligomers polymerize within minutes to form highly crosslinked networks and, thus, have potential for in situ formation. Varying the oligomer structure readily alters the physical properties of the resultant polymer networks. For instance, mechanical properties were highly dependent on the number of lactic acid and ethylene glycol units in the oligomer backbone. Additionally, polymer mass loss ranged from similar to 30 to 60% within 8 weeks of degradation time depending on the oligomer chemistry. Mechanical properties decreased with degradation of these polymers, indicating a bulk degradation mechanism. Finally, scaffolds with a controlled architecture were fabricated from these oligomers that show potential for tissue-engineering applications.

Heparin has anti-inflammatory effects and is often added to the peritoneal dialysis fluid to prevent fibrin formation. Conjugation of heparin to the surface of biomaterials has been shown to improve its biocompatibility. In this study, we describe for the first time an experimental chronic peritoneal dialysis model with repeated dwell studies in non-uraemic rats and evaluate the effect of addition of heparin to glucose-based peritoneal dialysis fluid on peritoneal fluid and solute transport. Methods. Wistar male rats, weighing 340 +/- 15 g, with implanted peritoneal catheters were infused during I month, twice per day with 20 ml of Dianeal 1.36%+antibiotics (AB; n = 10) or Dianeal 1.36% + antibiotics + heparin 2500 U/l (HAB; n = 9). After 10 (DS 1) and 30 days (DS 2), a dwell study was performed in rats with free access to drinking water, by infusing 30 mi of Dianeal 3.86%. Dialysate samples were obtained at 0, 2, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min. Blood samples were drawn before and at the end of the dwell. Radiolabelled serum albumin was used as macromolecular volume marker. Results. Peritoneal volumes during DS 1 were significantly greater for the HAB group as compared with the AB group. No differences in ultrafiltration were found during DS 2 for HAB vs AB. However, peritoneal volumes were significantly higher for DS 2 compared with DS I in the AB group. The amount of glucose absorbed over time did not differ between the solutions, while fluid absorption tended to be lower in the HAB group. Conclusions. Heparin may improve peritoneal fluid transport possibly due to better healing and reduced peritoneal inflammation as shown in this novel animal model of chronic peritoneal dialysis with repeated dwell studies.","Huddinge Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Div Baxter Novum, S-14186 Huddinge, Sweden; Huddinge Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Sci, Div Renal Med, S-14186 Huddinge, Sweden; Poznan Med Sch, Dept Pathophysiol, Poznan, Poland","Lindholm, B (reprint author), Huddinge Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Div Baxter Novum, K-56, S-14186 Huddinge, Sweden.",,"Waniewski, Jacek/A-6967-2008",,,,,16,28,28,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0931-0509,1460-2385,,NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL,Nephrol.

The mutation of the terminal arginine with lysine, another hydrophilic and positively charged amino acid, resulted in a drastic structural change. thus suggesting a major role of the terminal arginine residue in the overall oligopeptide's conformation and, hence, its bioactivity. In addition, the involvement of the aspartic acid residue in overall peptide structural stabilization also illustrates a previously undetermined role for this region (i.e. CDPG) of the oligopeptide.

The structures and conditions of formation of several domain-swapped dimers and trimers are known, but the formation of higher order 3D domain-swapped oligomers has been less thoroughly studied. Here we contrast the structural consequences of domain swapping from two designed three-helix bundles: one with an up-down-up topology, and the other with an up-down-down topology. The up-down-up topology gives rise to a domain-swapped dimer whose structure has been determined to 1.5 Angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallography. In contrast, the domain-swapped protein with an up-down-down topology forms fibrils as shown by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. This demonstrates that design principles can predict the oligomeric state of 3D domain-swapped molecules, which should aid in the design of domain-swapped proteins and biomaterials.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, DOE Lab Struct Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Johnson Res Fdn, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Eisenberg, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, DOE Lab Struct Biol, POB 951570, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",david@mbi.ucla.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM054616, R37 GM054616, GM-54616]",,,40,137,137,2,22,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Macrophages phagocytose orthopaedic debris and release proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases and other substances. In addition, other cell types present in tissues harvested from the bone-implant interface are thought to influence periprosthetic bone resorption. The present study examined the effects of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), cobalt chrome molybdenum alloy (CoCr), and titanium-alloy particle challenge on macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes in vitro. Potential synergistic effects of lymphocytes on macrophage activation were determined by measuring interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a release following exposure to orthopaedic biomaterial particles. Exposure of macrophages or macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes to all three types of particles resulted in increased release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a! at 48 h, when compared to macrophages or macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes, respectively, cultured in the absence of particles. Lymphocytes isolated from periprosthetic tissues secreted increased basal levels of cytokines relative to peripheral blood lymphocytes. Higher doses of PMMA and titanium-alloy particles stimulated increased levels of cytokine release in the macrophage and macrophage/lymphocyte groups. In contrast, a higher dose of CoCr particles (0.075% v/v) was not as effective as the 0.015% v/v dose, indicating probable CoCr toxicity. The macrophage/lymphocyte co-culture did not show synergism between the two types of cells with respect to cytokine release. T-cells at the bone-implant interface may alter the biological response to particulate debris. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We examined in vivo in a chronic sheep model the performance of a Biocor bovine internal mammary artery (BIMA) graft after No-React processing. Methods:'No-React' processing consists of aldehyde cross-linkage following a detoxification process with multiple physical variables and incubation with surfactant. Biocor BIMA No-React treated grafts have been interposed in the carotid artery in seven sheep with a Dacron graft as control. Grafts were explanted after 3 or 6 months and were grossly examined, by X-ray, histology, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: In the BIMA, good healing was found with a smooth intimal surface, minimal inflammatory reaction, and a well preserved ultrastructure. Calcification increased progressively. In the Dacron grafts, a fibrous covering the inner surface and infiltration with fibroblasts, histiocytes and macrophages was noted. Calcium content was stable, Conclusion: Calcification increased progressively in Biocor BIMA No-React grafts. Minimal inflammatory changes, a smooth inner surface and well preserved ultrastructure were noted. (C) 2001 The International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In vitro experiments were performed in order to evaluate the dissolution behavior of cisplatin in the system. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the final product consisted of a single phase, indicating that the sintering process had not affected the structure of the HA. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) showed absence of impurities. Pore diameters were in the range 15-34 mum.

The implants were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde one group (CG-G/PP) or left untreated (CG-nG/PP) and compared to PP mesh. At 4 weeks, the abdominal wall was assessed for the degree of adhesions. The composite implants developed a nascent connective tissue-like structure that reduced adhesions to the bowel, The thickest connective tissue developed in the CG-G/PP group (0.7 +/- 0.1 mm) and thinnest in the PP mesh (0.05 +/- 0.01 mm). The surface area covered with adhesions was greatest in the PP group (72 +/- 17%) compared with the CG-G/PP group (28 +/- 15%) or the CG-nG/PP group (21 +/- 8%). Bowel preferentially adhered to the PP mesh, whereas omentum had some adherence to all constructs. Integrating a biodegradable extracellular matrix analog with a permanent structural biomaterial reduced adhesions in this animal model. Alterations in cross-linking of the CG matrix altered the biological response, This technology may be useful in reconstructive surgery by reducing adhesion formation, while maintaining the strength of permanent structural biomaterials.

This material is able to keep the pH of a surrounding solution within the physiological range (7.2-7.6). This was achieved by chemical fine-tuning of the counterplay between the acidic degradation of the polyester and the basic dissolution of calcium phosphate. Microporous samples with pore sizes of <1 <mu>m and compact samples were prepared. The biological behavior was assayed in vitro by long-term osteoblast culture. Morphological and biochemical analyses of cell differentiation revealed excellent biocompatibility, leading to cell attachment, collagen and osteocalcin expression, and mineral deposition. This material could be of use as a biodegradable bone substitution material and as a scaffold for tissue engineering.

The treatment with a H2O2/HCl solution at 80 degreesC for 30 min followed by heating at 400 degreesC for 1 h produces an anatase titania gel layer on the specimen surface. This gel layer deposits apatite both on the contact and on open surfaces, and apatite deposition ability does not change with pre-staking in distilled water. The treatment with a NaOH solution at 60 degreesC for 3 days produces a sodium titanate gel layer. This gel layer can deposit apatite only on the contact surface, and the apatite deposition ability is completely lost after 1 day of pre-staking in distilled water. It is concluded, therefore, that the bioactivity of the titania gel originates from the favorable structure of the gel itself while the bioactivity of the sodium titanate gel depends heavily on ion release from the gel. The third treatment, a simple heat treatment at 400 degreesC for 1 h, produces a dense (not porous) oxide layer on the specimen surface. The specimens can deposit apatite on the contact surface after only 3 days of staking in SBF, but they cannot deposit apatite on the open surface for up to 2 months of staking. The implications of such apatite deposition behavior have been discussed in relation to the environments of titanium implants in bone as well as to the methodology of the SBF staking experiment.

The contrast in the damage to poly(urethane)s (PUs) was monitored by measuring radiolabel release elicited from a C-14-polyester-urea-urethane (PEUU) during incubation with both cell types. Human PMN were seeded onto polymer-coated glass slips and both radiolabel release as well as serine protease activity [assayed with N-benzyloxycarbonyl lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT)] were measured 18 h later. Human monocytes were cultured on polystyrene tissue culture plates for 14 days, trypsinized, and seeded onto the polymer-coated glass sips; then, radiolabel release and esterase activity [assayed with p-nitrophenylbutyrate (PNB)] were measured after 18 h. Coverslips with MDM were also incubated for an additional 2 weeks. At 18 h postincubation with the PEUU, MDM elicited 25 times more radiolabel release per 10(6) cells than PMN at 18 h and continued to increase more than sevenfold over the 18-h value during the subsequent 14-day period. The BLT activity in PMN did not increase significantly during the 18-h incubation period, whereas the PNB activity in MDM increased more than fourfold. The MDM, but not the PMN elicited radiolabel release, was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, as was the increase in PNB activity. The data provide evidence for a hydrolytic role for MDM and, to a lesser extent PMN, in the biodegradation of implanted materials. The full implication of the release of polymer-derived chemical agents from this hydrolytic cleavage of the implanted biomaterials, on the propagation of the inflammatory response, remains to be elucidated.

In these applications titanium is considered the ""gold standard."" However, tissue reactions around titanium implants and the changing trend to leave orthopedic devices in the body have led to a new examination of the preferred material. This in vitro study tested the behavior of osteoblasts on cpTi, Ti-6Al-7Nb, and stainless steel with surface designs similar to clinical implants. After surface characterization by scanning electron microscopy and profilometry, cell proliferation and the differentiation parameters of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin were measured. For all materials tested, the growth curves showed a similar kinetic. On Ti-6Al-7Nb, ALP activity was significantly lower when compared with steel, and cpTi and did not change over the time. ALP activity increased moderately on steel and cpTi. Osteocalcin levels were higher on both titanium materials than on steel. Based on undisturbed cell growth and the relatively high alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels, we suggest that cpTi provides the best biocompatibility with regard to proliferation, in addition to more reliable early and late differentiation markers of human osteoblasts in vitro.

The graft carries a coating of immobilized dipyridamole (Persantin(R)) on the surface of its lumen. Dipyridamole is a potent nontoxic inhibitor of platelet activation/aggregation, and also a strong inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. The polyurethane material is also known as Chronoflex(R), and already finds use as a vascular access graft. The coated vascular graft was studied in vitro (hemocompatibility, interaction with blood platelets and cultured endothelial cells), as well as in two established in vivo models. In the first in vivo study, coated grafts were implanted in goats, as a bypass of the carotid artery (four animals, eight grafts, length of the graft was approximately 12 cm). Four uncoated grafts were used as controls in otherwise identical experiments. in the second in vivo experiment, eight sheep were used. Each animal received one coated and one uncoated prosthesis as an interposition graft in the carotid artery (length of the graft was 4 cm). The in vitro experiments revealed that the dipyridamole coating has three beneficial effects: reduced thrombogenicity, reduced adherence of blood platelets, and accommodation of a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells. The goat experiments showed patency of the coated grafts in three of the eight cases. The sheep experiments were not useful for the evaluation of the dipyridamole coating because deterioration of the polyurethane material was observed. The in vivo results indicate that the dipyridamole coating may positively influence the patency rate, probably because the coating promotes the growth of an endothelial cell lining. The sheep data show, however, that the limited stability of the Chronoflex(R) material precludes its issue for the construction of permanent small-bore vascular grafts.

The peptides were selected based on their presumed preferential interactions with the cell-surface integrins on vascular endothelial cells. The ability of the surfaces to support the preferential adhesion of human vascular endothelial cells was studied by comparing in vitro adhesion results for these cells with those from mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Surface modification with the peptides was confirmed by water-contact angles and XPS. Surface morphology was determined by AFM and SEM. In vitro cell-culture studies in conjunction with plasma-protein adsorption and immunoblotting were performed on the various modified surfaces. The data suggest that peptide-modified surfaces have significant potential for supporting cell adhesion. Little or no cell adhesion was noted on gold- or cysteine-modified control surfaces. Human vascular endothelial cells showed the greatest adhesion to the CCRRG-DWLC-modified surfaces, and the 3T3 fibroblasts adhered best to the CREDV-modified surfaces. Protein adsorption studies suggest that the preferential adsorption of the cell-adhesive proteins fibronectin and vitronectin is not likely mediating the differences noted. It is concluded that the cell-adhesive peptide-modified gold-coated polymers have significant potential for further development both as model substrates for fundamental studies and for use in biomaterials applications.

We investigated whether tTgase enhances the biological recognition of poly (DL lactide co-glycolide) (PLG), poly (epsilon -caprolactone) (PCL), and poly (L lactide) (PLA), biomaterials widely used in medical implants. Three cell-model systems consisting of human osteoblasts, endothelial cells (ECV-304), and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were utilized, in which tTgase expression was modulated by gene transfer, and the ability of cells to spread on these polymers was quantified in relation to the altered level of expressed tTGase. Results show that over-expression of tTgase in human osteoblasts positively correlated with cell spreading on PLG, while no attachment and spreading was found on PCL and PLA. Antisense silencing of tTgase in the endothelial cells led to a marked reduction of cell spreading on all polymers. The hydrophobic nature of PLC also appeared to favor endothelial cell attachment. Spreading of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts on these biomaterials was only slightly affected by increased expression of tTgase, although cell spreading on control glass was increased. We propose that the consideration of tTgase-mediated bioactivity in novel biomaterials may improve cell attachment and promote biocompatibility.

For this purpose an endothelial cell surface heparansulfate, which belongs to the class of glycosaminoglycans is used as coating substance., This substance can be isolated from endothelial cell culture, tissue extracts or organ perfusates. Alternatively chemical regio- and stereoselective modified derivatives of the structurally related anticoagulant heparin were brought to action. These substances are anchored covalently or ionically by application of a wide spectrum of immobilization techniques on many different material surfaces. Polymer materials modified as described here have been tested for hemocompatibility in invitro and in invivo experiments with Austrian sheep. The results show, that the described method is an advanced solution for the creation of long term hemocompatible artificial material surfaces.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Klin Anstalten Stadt Koln, D-51109 Cologne, Germany","Baumann, H (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,22,6,6,1,2,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"BOSCHSTRASSE 12, D-69469 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

CL revealed internal structures within plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite coatings which were not discernible by SEM-BSE imaging. However, cathodoluminescence microscopy alone can presently not be used in every case to characterize synthetic calcium phosphate biomaterials because of the dominant intrinsic blue CL emission. In the future, optimum results will likely be achieved by using a combination of CL microscopy and spectroscopy with other spatially resolved analytical methods such as SEM-BSE, SEM-CL or micro-Raman spectroscopy. In the present study, different types of tetracalcium phosphate dental cements could be distinguished due to varying CL colours and CL spectra that are caused by a different content of impurity Mn. These results emphasize the advantages of spectral CL measurements for spatially resolved detection of trace elements in solids.","Freiberg Univ Min & Technol, Dept Mineral, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany; Univ Wurzburg, Dept Expt Dent, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Gotze, J (reprint author), Freiberg Univ Min & Technol, Dept Mineral, Brennhausgasse 14, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany.",,,,,,,16,19,19,0,2,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Calcium-phosphate ceramics are synthetic bone substitutes which promote new bone formation by osteoconduction. These ceramics possess osteoconductive properties but have no intrinsic osteoinductive capacity. They are unable to induce new bone formation in extraossesous sites. One solution to develop bone substitutes with osteogenic properties would be to associate biomaterials with osteoprogenitors. Materials and methods We studied the in vitro osteogenic potential of human bone-marrow cells cultured on macroporous calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic, examining stromal cell proliferation and differentiation. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated in terms of alkaline phosphatase activity and immunological characterization of the extracellular fibrillar matrix formed by these cells. The specimens were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results Human bone-marrow cells proliferated on CaP ceramic. The proliferating bone-marrow cells expressed an osteoblastic phenotype as shown by alkaline phosphatase activity and synthesis in ceramic pores of an extracellular matrix composed of fibronectin, osteocalcin and collagen 1. In addition, numerous microcrystals of apatite precipitated on the fibrillar matrix, producing a mineralized fibrillar network within the ceramic. Conclusion This study demonstrates that human bone-marrow cells cultured on macroporous CaP ceramic do not lose their osteoblastic phenotype even after 21 days of culture, and that they can induce osteogenesis in a CaP ceramic in vitro. This type of new ""hybrid material"" appears promising for the future.","Fac Med, Lab Physiopathol Resorpt Osseuse, F-44035 Nantes 1, France","Heymann, D (reprint author), Fac Med, Lab Physiopathol Resorpt Osseuse, 1 Rue Gaston Veil, F-44035 Nantes 1, France.",,,,,,,40,10,10,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

This review elucidates recent advances in the understanding of heteroepitaxy exemplifying the growth of copper on Ni(100) and the growth of para-hexaphenyl on GaAs. Although copper on nickel belongs to the simplest systems, unprecedented morphologies arise, such as ramified islands on a square lattice and strain relief by internal faceting. The elongated para-hexaphenyl crystallites formed on GaAs(001) exhibit a polarized blue light emission, which is a basis for developing organic diode lasers. Anisotropic thin film morphologies are also realized by oblique incidence deposition of noncentrosymmetric organic molecules onto amorphous substrates. Using the frequency doubling of light, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the films not only are anisotropic but also exhibit a preferential orientation of the molecules. Germanium nanopyramids epitaxially grown on Si(001) provide evidence that a well-defined nanopatterned substrate alters the contact angles of water, the protein adsorption and activity, as well as the cell behavior. These results are a milestone in structural biocompatibility on the nanometer scale.","ETH Zurich, Dept Werkstoffe, CH-8952 Schlieren, Switzerland","Muller, B (reprint author), ETH Zurich, Dept Werkstoffe, Wagistr 23, CH-8952 Schlieren, Switzerland.",,"Wu, Qihong/B-9803-2009; Muller, Bert/A-6838-2008; Schaff, William/B-5839-2009","Muller, Bert/0000-0003-4078-9109; ",,,,257,29,29,1,24,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"JOURNAL DEPT PO BOX 128 FARRER ROAD, SINGAPORE 912805, SINGAPORE",0218-625X,,,SURF REV LETT,Surf.

The prosthesis-peritoneum interface is the site of several possible problems, including the formation of adhesions and erosion of the intestinal loops, which mag lead to the formation of fistulas. This investigation was designed to compare the behavior of two prosthetic biomaterials in composite form at the level of the peritoneum. Defects (7 x 5 cm) were created in the abdominal wall of 18 white New Zealand rabbits weighing approximately 2500 g. The defects (involving aponeurotic and muscular planes and the parietal peritoneum) were repaired with polypropylene (PL) + ePTFE (Preclude dura substitute) or Parietex composite (PC) prostheses. The prostheses were secured to the edges of the defect by continuous PL sutures interrupted at the corners of the implant. Three study groups were established according to the type of implant: group I(n = 6) (controls)-PL; group II (n = 6)-PL + ePTFE; and group III (n = 6)-PC. The animals mere sacrificed 14 days after implant, and the prostheses were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The formation of adhesions at the prosthesis-visceral peritoneum interface were quantified according to a protocol previously described by us. The biomechanical resistance of the implant was evaluated using strips comprising prosthetic material and anchorage tissue. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare data corresponding to each group. There was no postimplant mortality. No infection or rejection of the prosthesis was observed in any of the animals. Firm adhesions were detected in the PL implants, whereas in the PL + ePTFE and PC implants the adhesions were loose. The mean prosthetic surface areas covered by adhesions mere 7.67, 0.10 and 0.19 cm(2) for groups I, II, and iii, respectively, shelving a significant difference between values corresponding to groups I and II and to groups I and III (p < 0.05). Comparison of values recorded for groups II and III yielded no significant difference (p >0.05). In groups II and III, the neoperitoneum was homogeneous and composed of organized and vascularized connective tissue covered by a mesoendothelium that was interrupted by accumulations of fibroblasts and white blood cells. In contrast, a disorganized neoperitoneum of rough texture was observed in the group I specimens. At times, areas of hemorrhage and necrosis corresponding to the sites of adhesion formation could be observed. Resistance to traction of composite implants (mean +/- SD: 15.72 +/- 1.32 and 15.89 +/- 2.73) was similar to that of the PL implants (15.03 +/- 2.92) (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0.05). It may be concluded that (1) composite prostheses show optimum behavior in terms of adhesion formation at the prosthesis-visceral peritoneum interface; (2) the neoperitoneum formed after the implant of a composite prosthesis almost physically and functionally replaces the normal peritoneum; (3) a significantly greater degree of peritoneal regeneration is achieved after implant of a PC prosthesis; and (4) there was no significant difference regarding biomechanical resistance between PL prostheses and PL + ePTFE and Parietex composites.","Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Madrid 28871, Spain","Bellon, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Crta Madrid Barcelona,Km 33-6, Madrid 28871, Spain.",,,"Garcia Honduvilla, Natalio/0000-0003-0904-6198; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,15,39,40,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0364-2313,,,WORLD J SURG,World J.Surg.,FEB,2001.0,25,2,,,,,147,152,,10.1007/s002680020069,,,,6,Surgery,Surgery,422QV,WOS:000168131500007,11338014.0,,,,2019-02-25

In odontology, using dental preparations containing fluorides could alter the behaviour of titanium. After a review of the experimental works dealing with the effects of fluoride ions at different pH on titanium salts in solution, it was proceeded to a thermodynamic investigation at 25 degreesC in the range of concentrations and pH corresponding to the solutions commonly used. Such a study gives a possibility to specify which species could be involved in the corrosion reaction to calculate the corresponding potentials, and lastly to define the domain of insolubility of TiO2. From these results, the reaction of titanium in laboratory spontaneous corrosion and voltammetric experiments was interpreted. From the recent experiments described and discussed in this article, it becomes evident that the close connection with the results obtained in this study contributes to support our thermodynamic model.

The P(CL-b-GA) and P(LA-b-GA) diblock copolymers that formed were fractionated by the use of a selective solvent for each block and were characterized by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The livingness of the operative coordination-insertion mechanism is responsible for the control of the copolyester composition, the length of the blocks, and, ultimately, the thermal behavior.

Amongst these biomaterials, hydroxyapatites (HA) offer good properties of biocompatibility and bioactivity when they interact with bone. This interaction depends mainly on the physico-chemical properties of HA particles. In this work, using a scanning transmission electronic microscope equipped with an Si(Li) detector for x-ray analysis, we analysed three kinds of hydroxyapatite: non-sintered particles, 600 degreesC sintered particles and 1180 degreesC sintered particles. Then, we determined the Ca/P concentration ratio in order to observe the influence of the temperature processing on this ratio. Concurrently, we carried out measurements on the HA powders by varying the electron irradiation dose either with the current density or with irradiation time. When the electron irradiation dose varied with the current density (at constant and short irradiation time), the Ca/P concentration ratio did not vary. But, at fixed current density and increasing irradiation time, the calcium and phosphorus intensities decreased, leading to an increase of the Ca/P concentration ratio at high electron irradiation dose. This phenomenon represents a mass loss of the specimen during electronic bombardment. We propose an experimental procedure to avoid all these problems.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 02, France","Benhayoune, H (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader, F-51685 Reims 02, France.",,"Laquerriere, Patrice/P-1025-2016","Laquerriere, Patrice/0000-0001-7637-9094",,,,15,20,20,1,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0022-3727,,,J PHYS D APPL PHYS,J.

The beam's interaction with biomaterials gives rise to concerns related to thermal damage and radiation damage. Of the two issues, the thermal interaction is conducive to rigorous analysis from first principles, although this has not been performed to date in a comprehensive manner. In this study, the interaction of the X-ray beam emanating from a third-generation synchrotron with a typical frozen biocrystal is theoretically studied, focusing specifically on the resulting unsteady (time-dependent) and steady heat-transfer phenomena. A unique regime map is developed to explain and to identify, on the basis of Fourier and Biot numbers as governing parameters, the applicable mathematical models that predict the subsequent thermal behavior. Depending on the values of these parameters, some simplified but realistic 'generic' solutions are generated that are suitable for that particular domain of applicability. Classical heat-transfer theory was used to describe the third-generation X-ray beam and biomaterial thermal interaction. Besides the generalized approach presented, numerous illustrative cases were solved and the resulting temperature levels are explicitly presented. Overall, the resulting thermal behavior of the system, i.e. peak and local temperature distribution, during both early transient development and for sustained long-time steady-state conditions, depends on a number of factors including the amount of energy absorbed, convective heat-transfer film coefficient and gas temperature, the sample size and shape, and the thermophysical properties of the sample and cooling gas. Results of the analysis revealed the strong influence that convection has on the transient and final steady-state temperature of the sample and the impact of internal heat conduction. The characteristic timescales of the important and dominant thermal processes with respect to the two types of thermal models are clearly identified.","Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Kazmierczak, M (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",,,,,,,16,40,40,2,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0907-4449,,,ACTA CRYSTALLOGR D,Acta Crystallogr.

They have also a relatively low young's modulus, allowing a good load transfer to the bone. The elastic modulus difference between metallic implant material and bone is large, which can lead to a fracture of the implant. To solve this problem, many implants for artificial joint and dental applications have been produced by powder metallurgy routes, obtaining a porous material with an even lower young's modulus than that of the bulk titanium. This porous structure allows bone ingrowth, as the osseous tissue invade the holes of the porous material while growing and adheres to it. Besides, near net shape technologies like powder metallurgy and injection molding techniques, can reduce the components high costs due to machining final steps, also providing a fine, uniform grain structure and lack of texture and segregation. This work outlines the characteristics, properties and some of the powder routes for producing titanium surgical implants and implant porous coatings.","Inst Nacl Tecnol, DMCM, BR-20081310 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; UFRJ, COPPE, Programa Engn Mat & Met, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; UFRGS, DMCM, INT, LdTM,Ctr Tecnol, BR-20081310 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","de Oliveira, MV (reprint author), Inst Nacl Tecnol, DMCM, Av Venezuela 82-603, BR-20081310 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",1013-9826,,0-87849-864-8,KEY ENG MAT,,,2001.0,189-1,,,,,,437,442,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.189-191.437,,,,6,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BS01C,WOS:000168303300069,,,,,2019-02-25

These actions involve fundamental aspects of tissue responses including injury, inflammatory and wound healing responses, foreign body reactions, and fibrous encapsulation of the biomaterial, medical device, or prosthesis. The second part of this review describes the in vivo evaluation of tissue responses to biomaterials, medical devices, and prostheses to determine intended performance characteristics and safety or biocompatibility considerations. While fundamental aspects of tissue responses to materials are important from research and development perspectives, the in vivo evaluation of tissue responses to these materials is important for performance, safety, and regulatory reasons.","Inst Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Anderson, JM (reprint author), Inst Pathol, 2085 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,,,,76,752,765,14,290,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1531-7331,,,ANNU REV MATER RES,Ann.

Several emerging strategies in biomaterials research take advantage of phospholipids to compartmentalize and/or template chemical reactions via self-assembled structures such as liposomes and tubules. Still others exploit the inherent biocompatibility of phospholipids and phospholipid-mimetic materials for use as novel tissue-contacting biomaterials that mimic biological membranes. In the future, phospholipid-based materials may be increasingly utilized as tools for the manipulation of cell and tissue responses to biomaterials, for controlled drug release, for reconstructive surgery, and as tissue-engineered constructs.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Collier, JH (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-collier@northwestern.edu; philm@northwestern.edu,"Messersmith, Phil/B-6695-2009; Sanguansri, Luz/B-6630-2011; Messersmith, Phillip/F-3433-2013","Sanguansri, Luz/0000-0003-1908-7604; Messersmith, Phillip/0000-0002-1197-333X",,,,116,100,104,1,76,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1531-7331,,,ANNU REV MATER RES,Ann.

Low and high-energy ion beams have been used, with both partially and fully cured phenolic resins, to enhance biological cell/tissue growth on, and to increase tissue adhesion to GPC surfaces. Samples bombarded with energetic ion beams in the keV to MeV range exhibited increased surface roughness, measured using optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Ion beams were also used to perform nuclear reaction analyses of GPC encapsulated drugs for use in internal drug delivery systems. The results from the high energy bombardment were more dramatic and are shown in this paper. The interaction of energetic ions has demonstrated the useful application of ion beams to enhance the properties of carbon-based biomaterials.","Alabama A&M Univ, Ctr Irradiat Mat, Normal, AL 35762 USA","Evelyn, AL (reprint author), Alabama A&M Univ, Ctr Irradiat Mat, Normal, AL 35762 USA.",,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,0-7354-0015-6,AIP CONF PROC,,,2001.0,576,,,,,,1024,1027,,,,,,4,"Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Physics, Atomic, Molecular & Chemical; Physics, Nuclear; Spectroscopy",Materials Science; Physics; Spectroscopy,BT20F,WOS:000172263600245,,,,,2019-02-25

The aim of the present study was to characterise an in vitro model of cultured rat femora and test the possibility of using this model in dynamic studies on bone healing. 24 femurs were explanted after 12 rats were killed for other experimental protocols. A standard bone defect was created in the distal femoral condyles and femurs were cultured in GBJb medium. Arginine and lysine were administered daily in the Arg-Lys group. The other femurs were left untreated (Control group). At 1, 7, 14 and 21 days, alkaline phosphatase activity, nitric oxide and calcium were measured on the supernatant. At 21 days, femurs were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate for histomorphometry and microhardness evaluation of the newly formed bone. The current results showed that it was possible to study bone healing in vitro by using cultured bones from adult animals. A process for bone healing was observed also in untreated bones. Moreover, the structural analysis of the cultured bone showed that it had characteristics similar to those of the femurs, when they were embedded in resin immediately after animal sacrifice. The effect of Arg and Lys confirmed data of a previous study, where a faster healing of bone defect and fracture was observed in rabbits after Arg and Lys administration.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Res Inst Cofivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Fac Med, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Torricelli, P (reprint author), Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Res Inst Cofivilla Putti, Dept Expt Surg, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/J-5298-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; TORRICELLI, PAOLA/0000-0001-7494-9970; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,13,6,6,0,3,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",1073-1199,,,ARTIF CELL BLOOD SUB,Artif.

We used Vero cells, a fibroblastic cell line, as the biological model of investigation. We found that cells attached slowly to all PLLA membranes studied. On the Ether hand, once the adhesion occurs, the cells are able to grow and differentiate on the different polymers. The cells grew to form a confluent monolayer and were capable of producing collagen Type IV and fibronectin on different PLLA membranes. This behavior indicates that cells try to create a better environment to stimulate their growth. This also indicates that Vero cells alter their differentiation pattern once they are producing extracellular matrix molecules related to epithelial differentiation.","State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Cell Biol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mat Engn, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Fac Odontol Piracicaba, Dept Social Odontol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Santos, AR (reprint author), State Univ Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Cell Biol, CP 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",,"Santos, Jr, Arnaldo/I-4813-2012; Dolder, Mary Anne Heidi/J-8618-2012; Duek, Eliana/J-2499-2012","Santos, Jr, Arnaldo/0000-0003-0535-0088; ",,,,36,30,32,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Another aim of this study was to evaluate different exposure regimes with which to assess cytotoxicity. The exposure regimes included: a 1-hour exposure in buffer followed by a 24-hour incubation in growth medium; a a-hour exposure in buffer followed by a 24-hour incubation in growth medium; a 24-hour exposure in serum-limited medium; and a 24-hour exposure in a serum-sufficient medium. The bioindicator target was the Smulow-Glickman (S-G) human gingival cell line and the biomaterials were dental restoratives. The Transwell insert methodology with the NRU cytotoxicity assay as the cytotoxicity endpoint was effective in differentiating the potencies of the dental restoratives; a a-hour exposure in buffer and a 24-hour exposure in serum-limited medium were the exposure regimes that most clearly differentiated the test agents according to their potencies.

The dynamic surface pressure, re-spreading ratio, compressibility, hysteresis area and recruitment index of pure films of the main phospholipids of pulmonary surfactant namely dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol ne, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and of binary mixed films of these phospholipids in the ratio of 2:3 were studied both in the presence and absence of calcium by in vitro analysis using a Wilhelmy balance. Surface excess films, of each of the surfactant systems, with initial concentration 15 Angstrom (2) molecule were compressed at the rate of 50 seconds/cycle past collapse till a compression ratio of 4:1. The presence of 5 mM calcium caused a significant decrease in compressibility (p < 0.05 Mann-Whitney U test) of all the surfactant monolayer films. No further benefit was obtained by adding 20 mM calcium over that of 5 mM calcium. A significant beneficial effect of calcium (p < 0.05 Mann-Whitney U test) on film stability was observed when analysing the materials in a pulsating bubble surfactometer, in which liposomal suspensions of 1% concentration in the presence of 5 mM calcium were pulsated at a high frequency of 40 cycles per minute, corresponding to the respiratory frequency of neonates. The ultrastructure of the liposomal suspensions were also studied using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy and longitudinal micro-tubular structures were found on addition of 5 mM calcium, which could have resulted in the improved performance of the exogenous surfactants with respect to compressibility and stability.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Cardiovasc Res, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Thin Films Lab, Bombay, Maharashtra, India","Banerjee, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Cardiovasc Res, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.",,,,,,,27,3,3,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

A major consideration in designing implants has been to produce surfaces that promote desirable responses in the cells and tissues contacting the implants. In this study, three titanium materials (commercially pure titanium - CPT -, Ti-6Al-4V, and TiNi) were treated mechanically, chemically, mechano-chemically, and thermally to produce concave surfaces with varying roughness. Using four media (distilled water, 1% NaCl aqueous solution, a suspension of human neutrophils, and a suspension of the MG-63 osteoblast-like cells), the initial contact angles were measured. Six readings (three drops each measured by two observers) were collected for each material and for each medium. The interclass correlation coefficients were used for the group comparisons. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) statistical analyses were employed. It was found, for CPT, that (1) statistically, there were no significant differences among four media in contact angles, (2) the contact angle increased linearly with average roughness when the angles were higher than 45 degrees, and (3) the contact angle decreased linearly with roughness when the angle was less than 45 degrees.","Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Dent Mat Div, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Prosthodont Grad Program, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Dent Ctr, Seoul, South Korea","Oshida, Y (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Restorat Dent, Dent Mat Div, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",yoshida@iupui.edu,,,,,,54,37,37,1,11,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0959-2989,1878-3619,,BIO-MED MATER ENG,Bio-Med.

The purification procedure of the polymers did not negatively influence the final microcapsule properties. The mechanical stability of microcapsules from purified material is even slightly higher than that of microcapsules from the original polymers. A second approach to avoid endotoxin release from the device is its direct complexation during the bead or capsule formation process. The durability of endotoxin binding in binary, ternary, and quaternary complexes could be demonstrated for storage in culture medium and saline. Very low total endotoxin release from the complexes was detected after three months in culture medium and five months in saline.

To match the physiological fluctuations of blood glucose concentrations with appropriate insulin release, the macroencapsulation material must combine immunoprotection with optimal diffusion properties for glucose and insulin. The impact of chemical modifications of polysulphone (PSU) capillary polymers with a cutoff of 50 kD on glucose-induced insulin secretion of macroencapsulated rat islets was studied in perifusion experiments. The insulin release of free-floating islets showed the typical rapid response to glucose stimulation. Total insulin release (AUC between minute 30 and 120 of perifusion) reached 117+/-22 ng/ml. Blending PSU with polyvinyl pyrrolidone or sodium-dodecyl-sulfate was not suitable for islet macroencapsulation, since glucose-induced insulin release was absent or disturbed. Hydroxy-methylation (CH2OH) of PSU improved the secretory behavior of macroencapsulated islets depending on the degree of PSU substitution (DS 0.8, AUC 62+/-15 ng/ml; DS 1.8, 111+/-24 ng/ml). In highly substituted PSU-capillaries the kinetics of glucose-induced insulin release was very similar to that observed in free-floating islets. Two consecutive glucose stimulations potentiated insulin release of free-floating islets during the second period of stimulation. Furthermore, freshly isolated macroencapsulated islets responded with more efficient insulin secretion after the initial priming. In conclusion, in vitro membrane screening identified highly substituted hydroxy-methylated PSU as the material of choice for islet encapsulation in a bioartificial pancreas.","Univ Tubingen, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Univ Tubingen, Inst Gen Surg, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Inst Text & Proc Engn, D-73770 Denkendorf, Germany","Lembert, N (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Morgenstelle 8, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,8,10,11,0,3,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-342-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2001.0,944,,,,,,271,276,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Transplantation",Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Transplantation,BT69D,WOS:000173774500022,11797676.0,,,,2019-02-25

Safety, consistency. and functionality of biomaterials used as matrices, scaffolds, and immobilizing agents in TEMPS are a concern. Therefore, the ASTM has established a number of task groups to produce standards and guidelines for such biomaterials. Alginate is a naturally occurring biomaterial used for immobilizing living cells to form an artificial organ, such as encapsulated pancreatic islets. In order to aid in successful clinical applications and to help expedite regulatory approval, the alginate used must be fully documented. The ASTM alginate guide gives information on selection of testing methodologies and safety criteria. Critical parameters such as monomer content, molecular weight, and viscosity, in addition to more general parameters, such as dry matter content, heavy metal content. bioburden, and endotoxin content are described in the ASTM document. In a like manner, the characterization parameters for chitosan, a bioadhesive polycationic polysaccharide, are described in a separate guide. For chitosan, the degree of deacetylation is of critical importance. Control of protein content and, hence, potential for hypersensitivity, endotoxin content, and total bioburden are important in chitosan preparations for TEMPS.

This will he accomplished with the help of three major thrusts: (1) use of molecularly manipulated nanostructured biomimetic materials; (2) application of microelectronic and nanoelectronic interfacing for sensing and control, and (3) application of drug delivery and medical nanosystems to induce, maintain, and replace a missing function that cannot be readily substituted with a living cell and to accelerate tissue regeneration. Biomimetics, involves employment of microstructures and functional domains of organismal tissue function, correlation of processes and structures with physical and chemical processes, and use of this knowledge base to design and synthesize new materials for health applications. Nanostructured materials should involve biological materials (rather then synthetic ones) because their prefabricated structure is suitable for modular control of devices from existing materials. Nanostructured tools should encompass surface patterned molecular arrays, nanoscale synthetic scaffolding mimicking the cell-extracellular matrix microenvironment, precise positioning of molecules with specific signals to provide microheterogeneity, composites of bioinorganic and organic molecules, molecular layering (coating), and molecular and supramolecular self-assembly and self-organization (template-directed) assembly.

After PLA dissolved with methylene chloride was mixed with the fibers, the mixture was dried completely and subsequently hot-pressed uniaxially under a pressure of 40 MPa at 180 degreesC, resulting in the fabrication of the PLA/HAF composite. The modulus of elasticity was improved effectively even by introducing a small amount of HAF; almost no degradation in the bending strength was observed and the modulus of elasticity showed high values of 5-10 GPa when the fibers of 20-60 wt% were introduced. With increasing HAF content, the maximum strain decreases and the specimen is apt to show a brittle fracture, this result implies that HAF in the composites can share the applied load efficiently due to the formation of a bond between HAF and PLA.

The optimum crosslink density and conditions required for curing coatings of these polymers were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and showed the inclusion of 5 mol% silyl crosslinking agent to be ideal. A nanoindentation technique was employed to determine if the coating developed elasticity upon crosslinking. The biological properties of the coatings were evaluated using a variety of protein adsorption assays and blood contacting experiments, and an enzyme immunoassay was developed to detect E. coli in order to assess the level of bacterial adhesion to these biomaterials.

We used FEM to explore the microscopic debonding mechanism of the dentin/hybrid layer/resin adhesive interface. The stress status of the local material was used as an index to judge whether the adhesive interface would develop a debonding mechanism. To generate the local stress concentration, the thermal boundary condition was applied to the model which has the phenomenon of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch. The thermal boundary condition was used to emulate a previous study conducted with a laser thermoacoustic technique (LTAT). The materials, Scotchbond MP, Optibond, and Tenure bonding systems, used in the previous experiment were also tested in this study. The results show that interfacial debonding in the finite element model occurred through the hybrid layer for both the Scotchbond MP and Tenure systems, as well as within the adhesive layer itself for the Optibond system. These findings are compatible with observations by SEM obtained by LTAT. Another transformed model was created to test the ""elastic cavity wall"" concept. The result also confirms the importance of the elastic cavity wall concept. These compatible results between FEM and LTAT indicate that FEM can be a very useful supplement to thermoacoustic testing.

This paper presents the design, synthesis, and characterization of multilayer thin films fabricated layer-by-layer by the ESA process using ceramics, polymers and fuctionalized fullerenes as candidate biomaterials. Preliminary tests on such fabricated ESA multilayer films were also conducted, including contact angle surface characterization, and in vitro protein adsorption studies with bovine albumin using Fourier Transform Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (FT-IRAS). The results indicate that the nanocomposite thin films fabricated with biomaterials by ESA processing may have broad potential applications for cell attachment and growth in tissue engineering.","Virginia Tech, Fiber & Electroopt Res Ctr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Wang, YX (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Fiber & Electroopt Res Ctr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,25,4,4,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3943-6,PROC SPIE,,,2001.0,4265,,,,,,142,151,,10.1117/12.427965,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Engineering; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BS41G,WOS:000169777000017,,,,,2019-02-25

Surface passivation of semiconductor and glass surfaces with thin organic films can attenuate the adhesion of proteins and cells that lead to biofilm formation and biofouling of fluidic structures. We have examined the adhesion of glial cells and serum albumin proteins to microfabricated glass and semiconductor surfaces coated with self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) and N-(triethoxysilylpropyl)-O-polyethylene oxide urethane (TESP), to evaluate the biocompatibility and surface passivation those coatings provide. These films were exposed to solutions containing serum albumin proteins (4 mg/mL), glial cells in culturing media, and glial cells under fluid flow. While the OTMS surface resisted cell spreading and growth under culture conditions, the same surface induced biofouling in a cell flow experiment with a microfluidic structure. Interestingly, the TESP surface, which was supportive of cell adhesion and proliferation under cell culturing conditions, effectively passivated the microfluidic structure to cell adhesion and biofouling. The results suggest that the cell adhesion process is not only dependent on the chemistry of the surface but also on the time allotted to the cell to probe the surface.","Sandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA","Sasaki, DY (reprint author), Sandia Natl Labs, MS 1413, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA.",dysasak@sandia.gov,,,,,,35,4,4,2,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,0-8194-3943-6,PROC SPIE,,,2001.0,4265,,,,,,152,163,,10.1117/12.427966,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Engineering; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",BS41G,WOS:000169777000018,,,,,2019-02-25

The final structure and form of the inorganic material is in some way controlled by the nature of the specific organic entities present. This manifests itself in the initiation of the growth, by providing the appropriate matrix in which the inorganic material forms and/or by providing a ""defect"" base such that the inorganic crystal packing may be appropriately perturbed. Working with proteins is not necessarily the best or easiest way to understand a physical process and over past years people have turned to simple organic molecules, surfactants, small biological moieties and organic substrates in order to determine, at least in part, the import of organic/inorganic interactions during the growth of the inorganic material. As one example of these additives, surfactants, which represent approximately 50% of the cell membrane, display a diverse and vast array of geometrical forms in aqueous solution, many of which bare striking resemblance to biominerals, albeit on considerably smaller length scales. They also have the ability to associate in solution with inorganic material precursors, such as calcium ions. Hence, while they may not be the main driving force in the formation of biominerals, they are certainly present during the process and may, when used as model systems, allow us some way into the world of nanomaterials. Surfactants, a series of simple alcohols and carboxylic acids, and proteins extracted from the spines of adult sea urchins, have been used by our group to study the fori-nation of calcium carbonate based inorganic materials. The growth of the calcium carbonate is significantly affected by the inclusions, with deviations varying from simple stepped growth to the formation of curved surfaces.","Univ Otago, Dept Chem, Dunedin, New Zealand","McGrath, YM (reprint author), Univ Otago, Dept Chem, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",,,"Wilbanks, Sigurd/0000-0001-7565-8913; McGrath, Kathryn/0000-0003-3531-0562",,,,12,1,1,0,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4320-4,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2001.0,4590,,,,,,14,25,,10.1117/12.454624,,,,12,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Engineering; Materials Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BU25E,WOS:000175475300003,,,,,2019-02-25

Application of molecular thickness coatings of biologically active macromolecules provides predictable interfacial control over interactions with biological media. The covalent surface immobilization of polysaccharides, proteins, and synthetic oligopeptides can be achieved via ultrathin interfacial bonding layers deposited by gas plasma methods, and the multistep coating schemes are verified by XPS analyses. Interactions between biomolecular coatings and biological fluids are studied by MALDI mass spectrometry and ELISA assays. Using a colloid-modified AFM tip, quantitative measurement of interfacial forces is achieved. Comparison with theoretical predictions allows elucidation of the key interfacial forces that operate between surfaces and approaching macromolecules. In this way, it is possible to unravel the fundamental information required for the guided design and optimization of biologically active nanoscale coatings that confer predictable properties to synthetic carriers.

Many of these applications require patterns of specific proteins that allow subsequent two-dimensionally controlled cell attachment. The ideal technique would allow the deposition of specific protein patterns in areas where cell attachment is required, with complete prevention of unspecific protein adsorption in areas where cells are not supposed to attach. In our study, collagen I was used as an example for an extracellular matrix protein known to support the attachment of bovine corneal epithelial cells. An allylamine plasma polymer was deposited on a silicon wafer substrate, followed by grafting of poly(ethylene oxide). Two-dimensional control over the surface chemistry was achieved using a 248 nm excimer laser. Results obtained by XPS and AFM show that the combination of extremely low-fouling surfaces with excimer laser ablation can be used effectively for the production of spatially controlled protein patterns with a resolution of less than 1 mum. Furthermore, it was shown that bovine corneal epithelial cell attachment followed exactly the created protein patterns.

Comparing materials under equivalent flow conditions, S. aureus attach to stainless steel and titanium with equal strength and more strongly than to Thermanox. For fibroblasts, detachment strength from all materials was similar. Fibroblast detachment strength from these biomaterials substantially decreases with time at equal flow rates and increases with flow rate at equal exposure times. Detachment strength is very similar for 3T3 and L929 fibroblasts on Thermanox for equivalent flow rate/time combinations, though enhanced adhesion of 3T3 cells was often noted for metals. Time effects are less evident for S. aureus. S. aureus adhesion to metals is more affected by flow rate than fibroblast adhesion.

There is a great clinical need for new materials with enhanced properties for application in the diarthrodial joint. Photopolymerizations may provide many advantages for fabricating new biomaterials for the TMJ and may address some of the notable differences between the TMJ and other articulations. Specifically, the feasibility of trans-tissue (i.e. through the skin) photopolymerizations may yield less-invasive surgical procedures. Also, novel 3-dimensional photoprocessing techniques may be used to fabricate patient-specific alloplastic devices for improved compliance and efficacy.

The surfaces of different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene have been characterized-including during the glass transition and when mechanically stretched. Copolymers that have hard and soft segments with different glass transition temperatures show phase separation, an effect of hydrogen bonding between the hard and soft segments, that influences their adhesive and friction properties. AFM and SFG show that low surface energy additives migrate to the surface and alter the surface mechanical properties. Polymers, where the chemical nature of the end groups is different from the backbone, show surface segregation of the hydrophobic part of the chain in air and the hydrophilic part in water. Likewise, in miscible polymer blends, surface segregation of the more hydrophobic component in air and the more hydrophilic component in water is observed. This area of surface science requires increased attention because of the predominance of polymers as structural materials and as biomaterials.

The Escherichia coli (MC1061 and JM109) strains, used as negative controls, adhered poorly to FN immobilized on microtiter wells (adherence indices of 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 0.03 +/- 0.01 10(5) CFU/well, respectively). Two P. aeruginosa strains (NK125502 and ER82483) were highly adherent to FN (adherence indices of 3.22 +/- 0.75 10(5) and 3.08 +/- 1.42 10(5) CFU/well, respectively), the two others (ER98513 and ER92581) adhered less efficiently (adherence indices of 0.91 +/- 0.05 10(5) and 0.45 +/- 0.23 10(5) CFU/well, respectively). The two P. fluorescens strains (MFO and ER74508) were highly adherent to fibronectin (adherence indices of 7.06 +/- 1.00 10(5) and 2.08 +/- 0.67 10(5) CFU/well, respectively). Cefsulodin was the only antimicrobial agent tested that decreased the FN adherence of the majority of the strains: decrease in adherence highly significant (p < 0.01) for the P. fluorescens MFO strain, significant (p < 0.05) for the P. aeruginosa NK125502, ER98513 and the P. fluorescens ER74508 strains, and not significant for the P: aeruginosa ER92581 strain. The effects of chloramphenicol and polymyxin B on the adherence of Pseudomonas were strain dependent. Gentamicin had no statistically significant effect on bacterial adherence. We conclude that, in addition to its antibacterial activity, cefsulodin could be effective in preventing the adherence of fluorescent Pseudomonas to FN, an important property in the presence of injured epithelium and coated biomaterials.

In this regard amino functional groups play a key role. They provide an excellent basis for subsequent modifications with specific biomolecules. It would be of great value to get an amino functionalization independent of the specific material in use. The paper reports on an investigation concerning the feasibility of such an universal plasma functionalization procedure, Two different downstream microwave plasma sources were taken to apply a procedure, which was developed for high-grade modification of polystyrene (PS), to a number of other polymers including polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polyethylenenaphthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene, (PE), (PMMA) and fluorinated polymers. In many cases, very similar results were obtained. At maximum of 5% of the surface were covered by nitrogen functional groups. In some cases, about 50% of total nitrogen functional groups,were amino groups. The results suggest that a downstream ammonia plasma treatment indeed is a fairly universal method for high performance amino functionalization or polymeric biomaterials.","Inst Niedertemp Plasmaphys, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Schroder, K (reprint author), Inst Niedertemp Plasmaphys, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",,"Meyer-Plath, Asmus/E-4573-2011","Meyer-Plath, Asmus/0000-0001-9037-7706",,,,17,69,69,2,19,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 BERLIN, GERMANY",0863-1042,,,CONTRIB PLASM PHYS,Contrib.

Since not all species of a given analyte have the same detrimental impact on the environment, new analytical devices and techniques are required to distinguish between the different species of a pollutant or different groups of pollutants. This paper describes analytical techniques based on biomaterials that are toxically sensitive to pollutants. This approach permits the biomonitoring of certain compounds by looking at their toxic properties. Although these techniques are based on a sound analytical strategy, their applications are limited because most of the interactions between the biological material and the analyte are irreversible. Additionally, the immobilised biological material has a limited stability. Several biomonitoring strategies based on electrochemical biosensing are discussed here and how to recover the bioactivity of biosensing system, both in discrete and automated procedures, is also reviewed.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Quim, Grup Sensors & Biosensors, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain","Alegret, S (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Quim, Grup Sensors & Biosensors, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.",salegret@gsb.uab.es,,,,,,68,10,10,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Absolute controls had laparotomy only, controls had mesenteric window wounding, test groups had the insertion of either a thread of collagen, polyglactin 910, polyglycolic acid salt, silk or of a titanium clip. We considered the percentage area of the mesenteric window covered by neovessels. After 7 days, negligible angiogenesis was found in absolute controls, significant angiogenesis in controls, collagen, polyglactin 910 and polyglycolic acid salt treated rats, without differences between treatments. A significant increase of angiogenesis in comparison to the control group was found in rats treated with silk and titanium. Ultramicroscopy of the neovessels showed specific changes of their architecture in titanium-treated rats. In conclusion, angiogenesis during wound healing is differently influenced by the suture material used, Silk and titanium stimulated angiogenesis in a different way. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG.

Unfortunately, while extensive research has focused on chemical treatment technologies to reduce negative in-vivo effects such as mineralization and to enhance overall biocompatibility, little work has been done on understanding the effects of fatigue on tissue mechanical properties. in the current work, a structure-based model for the evolution of mechanical properties with cyclic loading of chemically treated soft tissues is presented. The model is used to clarify and relate the impact of different structural changes, such as collagen fiber debonding and collagen fiber weakening, to changes in macro-level tissue mechanical properties. The model will ultimately serve as a guide for the development of key experiments for fatigue damage assessment of novel chemical treatment technologies. This will aid in the rational development, as opposed to the current ad-hoc approach, of novel chemically modified collagenous biomaterials for more durable cardiac valve bioprostheses.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Bioengn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Slaughter, WS (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",,,,,,,4,3,3,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,ZURICH-UETIKON,"BRANDRAIN 6, CH-8707 ZURICH-UETIKON, SWITZERLAND",1013-9826,,0-87849-871-0,KEY ENG MAT,,,2001.0,198-1,,,,,,255,260,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.198-199.255,,,,6,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science,BS10M,WOS:000168666500010,,,,,2019-02-25

Two generic properties of Nitinol, thermally induced shape recovery and superelasticity, are successfully employed for medical uses. However, several aspects of the alloys' short and long term efficacy have yet to be comprehensively determined, especially parameters relating to surface and corrosion performance, The present review surveys studies carried out internationally over about the past 10 years aiming at an improved understanding of Nitinol's surface, corrosion, and biocompatibility features. A critical survey is given of the surface condition of alloys modified using various advanced techniques, oxidised in air-water-steam mixtures, and passivated using chemical-electrochemical procedures, Surface parameters and their importance to the improvement of Nitinol's corrosion resistance and biological performance are discussed on the basis of XPS, Auger, SEM, and BSEM studies. In vivo and in vitro corrosion studies using potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, and scratch tests on as cast alloys, wire, and actual devices are surveyed. The effects of stress, strain, heat treatment, microstructure, precipitates, and alloy composition on corrosion are evaluated and compared with data for stainless steels, cobalt base alloys, and titanium. Release of nickel, observed in vitro and in vivo, is also surveyed. Biocompatibility aspects are briefly discussed with emphasis on their possible correlation with surface condition.","Iowa State Univ, Inst Phys Res & Technol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Shabalovskaya, SA (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Inst Phys Res & Technol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,138,71,75,2,26,MANEY PUBLISHING,LEEDS,"HUDSON RD, LEEDS LS9 7DL, ENGLAND",0950-6608,,,INT MATER REV,Int.

For same components the higher surface roughness is preferred to increase the adherence and anchorage between the implant and the bone. In this work sandblasting prior to the oxidation is used to increase the surface roughness of the oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) FeCrAl alloy. The effect of sandblasting on its oxidation and corrosion behaviour is studied. As a comparison, polished samples are also studied. The alloy treated at 1 100 degreesC generates a dense alpha -alumina layer which thickness increases with increasing exposure time, being the values somewhat lower for the sandblasted samples. Impedance diagrams obtained for sandblasted samples preoxidised for 1 and 3 h show impedance values at the lowest frequency two orders of magnitude lower than those for polished samples. This decrease in the impedance value can be attributed to the presence of paths or fine cracks in the alumina layer that communicate the aggressive medium with the metallic substrate. Spallation of the alumina layer in preoxidised sandblasted samples has been detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for treatment times of 10 and 100 h. Despite this loss of the scale integrity, the corrosion behaviour is good.","CSIC, CENIM, Ctr Nacl Invest Met, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Garcia-Alonso, MC (reprint author), CSIC, CENIM, Ctr Nacl Invest Met, Avda Gregorio Amo 8, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",escudero@cenim.csic.es,"Garcia-Alonso, Maria Cristina/K-3779-2014; Gonzalez Carrasco, Jose Luis/A-7971-2008; Escudero, Maria Lorenza/L-7113-2014","Garcia-Alonso, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-0275-4626; Escudero, Maria Lorenza/0000-0002-2181-448X; Gonzalez-Carrasco, Jose Luis/0000-0003-2004-4505",,,,29,3,3,1,6,IRON STEEL INST JAPAN KEIDANREN KAIKAN,TOKYO,"TEKKO KAIKAN-5F, 3-2-10, NIHONBASHI-KAYABACHO, TOKYO, CHUO-KU 103-0025, JAPAN",0915-1559,1347-5460,,ISIJ INT,ISIJ Int.,,2001.0,41,1,,,,,56,62,,10.2355/isijinternational.41.56,,,,7,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,396FF,WOS:000166625100008,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Surfactants available commercially vary widely in composition and biophysical properties. The present paper studies the ultrastructure of three exogenous surfactants used for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome, namely, Survanta(TM), ALEC(TM) and Exosurf Neonatal(TM) with respect to their ability to form liposomes using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy. Liposomal organisation is more obvious in Exosurf than in Survanta and is most pronounced in ALEC. ALEC forms closed regular liposomes with an onionring-like internal bilayer arrangement. Survanta forms open membranous structures with wavy ribbon-like membranes. The complex membrane-like structures seen with Survanta may be due to the interaction of lipids with surfactant-specific proteins present in this surfactant which is derived from natural lung extracts and might indicate superior spreading at the lipid-water interface. Artificial protein-free surfactants (ALEC and Exosurf) did not appear to form these open membranous structures. Further study of the ultrastructure of possible biomaterials as surfactants could help in the development of new, improved artificial protein-free surfactants with open membranous structures that might facilitate spreading at the air-liquid interface of lungs.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Mumbai 400076, India",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0885-3282,,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

AMPAC, a semiempirical computer program that provides quantum mechanical information for chemical structures, was applied to three series of reference chemicals. a set of methacrylates. a set of aromatic and a set of aliphatic epoxy compounds. QSAR models were developed using this chemical information together with mutagenicity data (Salmonella TA100, Ames Test). CODESSA. a QSAR program that calculates quantum chemical descriptor from information generated by AMPAC and statistically matches these descriptors with observed biological properties was used. QSARs were developed which had r(2) values exceeding 0.90 for each study series. These QSARs were used to accurately predict the mutagenicity of BISGMA, a monomer commonly used in dentistry, and two epoxy monomers with developing use in dentistry, GY-281 and UVR-6105. The Q-QSAR quantum mechanical descriptors correctly predicted the level of mutagenicity for all three compounds. The descriptors in the correlation equation painted to components of structure that may contribute to mutagenesis. The QSARs also provided 'dose windows' for testing mutagenicity, circumventing the need for extensive dose exploration in the laboratory.

The physico-chemical, mechanical, and biological properties of these materials were investigated by different techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and in vitro release tests, with the aim of evaluating the miscibility of the polymer blends and to establish their potential applications. The results indicate that while dextran is perfectly miscible with PAA, dextran/PVA, chitosan/PVA, starch/PVA, and gellan/PVA blends behave mainly as two-phase systems, although interactions can occur between the components. Cross-linked starch/PVA films could be employed as dialysis membranes: they showed transport properties comparable to, and in some cases better than, those of currently used commercial membranes. Hydrogels based on dextran/PVA and chitosan/PVA blends could find applications as delivery systems. They appeared able to release physiological amounts of human growth hormone, offering the possibility to modulate the release of the drug by varying the content of the: biological component.","Univ Pisa, Dept Chem Engn, I-56100 Pisa, Italy","Cascone, MG (reprint author), Univ Pisa, Dept Chem Engn, Via Diotisalvi 2, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.",,,,,,,36,114,116,3,50,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

For long-term testing of new biomaterials as artificial basement membrane substitutes, it is important to simulate this fluid gradient. Individually-selected biomaterials can be placed in tissue carriers and in gradient containers, where different media are superfused. Epithelia growing on the tissue carriers form a physiological barrier during the whole culture period. Frequently however, pressure differences between the luminal and basal compartments occur. This is caused by a unilateral accumulation of gas bubbles in the container compartments resulting in tissue damage. Consequently, the occurence of gas bubbles has to be minimized. Air bubbles in the perfusion culture medium preferentially acumulate at sites where different materials come into contact. The first development is new screw caps for media bottles, specifically designed to allow fluid contact with only the tube and not the cap material. The second development is the separation of remaining gas bubbles from the liquid phase in the medium using newly-developed gas expander modules. By the application of these new tools, the yield of embryonic renal collecting duct epithelia with intact barrier function on a fragile natural support material can be significantly increased compared to earlier experiments.","Univ Regensburg, Dept Anat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany","Minuth, WW (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Anat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",,,,,,,25,11,11,0,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Much effort has been devoted to develop new materials that do not activate or deteriorate the complement system. The present work is aimed at revealing the mode of reactions of anionic poly(2-acrylamido 2-methylpropane sulfonate) grafted on polystyrene bead (PAMPS-g-bead) with serum complement. Complement activity assay, determination of complement proteins levels, and immunoblot analysis were carried out for sera pretreated with PAMPS-g-beads. The results clearly showed that, when PAMPS-g-bends were incubated with serum, those beads adsorbed several complement proteins, i.e. C1q, factor D, factor P, C6, and C8, but the generation of activation fragments of complement components was not observed. Especially, factor D was most effectively removed from serum, resulting in potential inhibition of the alternative pathway. A larger amount of PAMPS-g-beads was needed to decrease the serum CH50 level. That may be caused by removal of C6. Although some polyanions, such as dextran sulfate, were reported to activate the complement system, the obtained results indicate that the PAMPS-g-bead is not an activator of the complement pathway, but acts as an adsorbent of complement components. One possible clinical application of the PAMPS-g-beads is adsorption of serum factor D by extracorporeal treatment of patients with renal failure with a high level of factor D, because the increased quantity of factor D in serum may cause consistent activation of the alternative pathway.","Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; Osaka Prefectural Coll Hlth Sci, Osaka 5838555, Japan; Suzuka Univ Med Sci, Suzuka, Mie 5100293, Japan","Iwata, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Sakyo Ku, 53 Kawahara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",,,,,,,26,7,7,1,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The surface properties of artificial biomaterials have been thought as the key factors which mediate the interactions between the biological environment and biomaterial itself, In this study, the sulfonation was directly performed on the chitosan membrane surface. The chitosan membrane was surface-sulfonated by reactions with sulfur-pyridine trioxide complex (SO3/pyridine) in H2O solution and N,N-sulfur-dimethylformamide trioxide complex (SO3/DMF) in DMF. Blood compatibility was evaluated by an in vitro platelet adhesion assay. The surface reaction Of SO3/pyridine in aqueous acid medium yields N,O-sulfated chitosan with cationic NH3+ groups, After neutralization, this surface has been shown to induce a low degree of platelet adhesion and activation. When the surface-sulfonation is performed in an aqueous alkaline medium, although the degree of sulfonation is lower than the samples above, the N-sulfated chitosan significantly reduced the adhesion and activation of platelets. For the acidic SO3/DMF reaction system, N,O-sulfated chitosan was obtained with a high extent of sulfonation and cationic NH3+ groups. On this surface 3 fully spread platelets and some platelet aggregates were found instead. This may be attributed to the ionic interactions between the platelets membrane surface and the cationic groups on the modified chitosan membrane.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan","Lin, JC (reprint author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,"Lin, Jui-Che/C-8230-2012","Lin, Jui-Che/0000-0003-4436-655X",,,,44,18,19,0,12,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The contact involved adding heparinized whole blood to small diameter tubes that were connected to two arms extending from a rocking platform. For all surfaces (polyethylene, polypropylene, Silastic (TM), PVA hydrogel) tested there was strong evidence of platelet activation in the bulk blood: platelet-derived microparticles, procoagulant platelet membranes and soluble P-selectin levels. Flow cytometric quantification of microparticles (MPs) was highly sensitive and entailed the direct determination of microparticle concentrations as opposed to the traditional quantification of microparticle percentages (relative to total number of MPs and platelets). Whole blood contact with polypropylene surfaces led to the greatest drops in bulk platelet counts and also to the lowest increases in microparticle concentrations. Flow cytometry was also used to assess procoagulant levels (annexin V binding) within a light scatter region known to contain platelets and some large microparticles. All surfaces were noted to generate a significant procoagulant population that was, based on forward light scatter, mostly very small platelets or large microparticles. In contrast, most of the P-selectin positive platelets were averaged sized. Lastly, all surfaces generated soluble P-selectin levels that were approximately double the level (25 ng ml(-1)) noted in the resting whole blood samples. In addition to our previous reports, these findings support the observation that there is strong evidence of platelet activation in the bulk that we anticipate will ultimately lead to more relevant in vitro testing of the compatibility of platelets towards materials.","Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5G 2M1, Canada","Gemmell, CH (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5G 2M1, Canada.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL24020],,,21,31,31,0,8,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Monocyte and macrophage interactions with biomaterial surfaces are thought to be mediated by adsorbed adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen and fibronectin. Non-fouling surfaces that minimize protein adsorption may therefore minimize monocyte adhesion, activation, and the foreign body response. Radio-frequency glow discharge plasma deposition (RF-GDPD) of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tetraglyme) was used to produce polyethylene oxide (PEO)-like coatings on a fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) surface. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and static time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were used to characterize the surface chemistry of tetraglyme coating. Fibrinogen adsorption to the tetraglyme surface was measured with I-125-labeled fibrinogen and ToF-SIMS. Adsorption of fibrinogen to plasma deposited tetraglyme was less than 10 ng cm(-2), a 20-fold decrease compared to untreated FEP or tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Monocyte adhesion to plasma deposited tetraglyme was significantly lower than adhesion to FEP or TCPS. In addition, when the surfaces were preadsorbed with fibrinogen, fibronectin, or blood plasma, monocyte adhesion to plasma deposited tetraglyme after 2 h or 1 day was much lower than adhesion to FEP. RF-GDPD tetraglyme coating provides a promising approach to make non-fouling biomaterials that can inhibit non-specific material-host interactions and reduce the foreign body response.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,51,66,70,0,11,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The viability of osteoblasts attached to poly(2EG10LA) and poly(2EG6LA) was close to the TCPS and PLGA after 7 and 14 days of culture, whereas cell viability was similar to50%, lower on poly(8EG6LA). Additionally, the alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization of attached osteoblasts were similar on poly(2EG10LA) and PLGA, whereas these markers of bone formation were significantly lower for poly(2EG6LA) and poly(8EG6LA). For example, the alkaline phosphatase activity of rat calvarial osteoblasts attached to poly(2EG10LA) was 0.048+/-0.006 mumol mg(-1) protein-min, but only 0.030+/-0.003 mumol mg(-1) protein-min for osteoblasts attached to poly(8EG6LA) after 14 days of culture. Finally, osteoblasts were seeded onto three-dimensional scaffolds to demonstrate the applicability of the scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.","Univ Colorado, Dept Chem Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Anseth, KS (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Chem Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [AR44375-02],,,29,21,23,0,11,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In this study, the effects of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) treatment on acellularized ovine carotid arteries were studied under two different pH conditions: (i) pH controlled at an optimal value of 5.5; and (ii) a simpler, but industrially significant, uncontrolled pH system. A multimode approach was employed involving biochemical assays, thermomechanical, tensile, and shear mechanical testing, and irt vitro enzyme degradation analyses. EDC treatment decreased the hoop tangent modulus of acellular matrix (ACM) arterial grafts measured at 20 kPa of stress regardless of pH control. Extensibility of ACM arterial grafts measured at 20 kPa of stress was reduced after EDC treatment with pH control only. In contrast, shear stiffness of ACM arterial grafts increased to a greater degree under crosslinking without pH control (21 x compared to 14 x with pH control). Thermomechanical analyses revealed that EDC cross-linking with pH control also increased the collagen denaturation temperature of ACM arteries to a greater degree (a rise of 24.3 +/- 0.6 degreesC vs. 21.7 +/- 0.7 degreesC for no pH control), whereas cross-linking without pH control consumed a larger amount of lysine residues after 3 h of treatment. Most interestingly, both EDC treatments were equally effective in stabilizing ACM arteries against multiple degradative enzymes in vitro. The observed differences between EDC treatments under different pH conditions are attributed to differences in the location and types of the exogenous cross-links formed. The absence of pH control may have favored the formation of interfibrillar or intermolecular cross-links in collagen as well as involvement of other extracellular matrix components (proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans), Furthermore, it may be emphasized that the location or type of cross-links differentially affected the mechanical behavior of treated materials without affecting the increase in resistance to enzymatic degradation.

Osteoblasts seem to participate directly in this phenomenon. This paper investigates in vitro cellular response to the wear particles from the metal substrate and ceramic covering (alpha -alumina) of a new titanium yttrium aluminum alloy, MA 956, that has been proposed as a biomaterial because of its exceptional mechanical and electrochemical properties. The effect of different sizes (10 and 80 mum) of MA 956 and alpha -alumina particles on osteoblast function was studied in primary human bone cell cultures. Cells were harvested from trabecular bone fragments obtained during knee arthroplasty. Osteoblastic cell response to the particles was measured by assaying C-terminal type I procollagen (PICP), alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin secretion, with and without 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation, in the cell-conditioned medium. Both sizes of MA 956 and alpha -alumina particles decreased PICP secretion in nonstimulated osteoblastic cells, but this secretion was not affected in the cultures stimulated with 1.25(OH)(2)D-3. Only the 10 mum alpha -alumina particles inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in 1.25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated and nonstimulated cultures. The rise in osteocalcin levels after 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation was lower in the presence of the 10 mum MA 956 particles than in the presence of alpha -alumina particles. Although both materials seem to ha ve directly affected in vitro osteoblastic cell function, the increase in osteocalcin levels after 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation was lower after exposure to MA 956 particles than the increase observed after exposure to alpha -alumina particles. Therefore, it does not seem that osteocalcin stimulated bone resorption, suggesting that MA 956 would be less likely to provoke osteolysis.

Two photocrosslinkable polysaccharides composed of alginate and hyaluronan are described that upon photolysis form soft, flexible, and viscoelastic hydrogels. The degree of methacrylate modification and thus covalent affects mechanical properties such as swelling, compression, and creep compliance. Significant swelling is observed in aqueous solution; these hydrogels can swell up to 14 times their dry weight. Both hydrogels exhibit low phase angles and I G* I values indicative of viscoelastic materials. The hyaluronan based hydrogel is stronger and more resilient than the corresponding alginate gel. SEM and AFM studies on both hydrogels show smooth and uniform surfaces at the macroscopic level with salient features observed only on the nanometer scale. Rapid polymerization by an optical trigger allows for controlled in situ photopolymerization in a minimally invasive manner, indicating that these hydrogels are relevant for biomedical applications such as sealing wounds and reconstructing soft tissues.

We report on the covalent decoration of silk films with integrin recognition sequences (RGD) as well as parathyroid hormone (PTH, 1-34 amino acids) and a modified PTH 1-34 (mPTH) involved in the induction of bone formation. Osteoblast-like cell (Saos-2) responses to the decorated silk films indicate that the proteins serve as suitable bone-inducing matrices. Osteoblast-like cell adhesion was significantly increased on RGD and PTH compared to plastic, mPTH, and the control peptide RAD. At 2 weeks of culture, message levels of alkaline phosphatase were similar on all substrates, but by 4 weeks, alkaline phosphatase mRNA was greatest on RGD. At 2 weeks of culture, alpha1(I) procollagen mRNA was elevated on silk, RGD, RAD, and PTH, and hardly detectable on mPTH and plastic. However, by 4 weeks RGD demonstrated the highest level compared to the other substrates. Osteocalcin message levels detected by RT-PCR were greatest on RGD at both time points. Calcification was also significantly elevated on RGD compared to the other substrates with an increase in number and size of the mineralized nodules in culture. Thus, RGD covalently decorated silk appears to stimulate osteoblast-based mineralization in vitro.

Geometry is crucially important for the:scaffold in bone and joint tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to elucidate principles of geometry of matrices in designing new scaffolds and matrices for use in reconstruction of bone and joints. Methods: More than ten biomaterials with different geometries, including a unique device of honeycomb-shaped hydroxyapatite, were combined with BMPs of recombinant (rhBMP-2) or natural bovine origin (S300 BMP cocktail) and implanted subcutaneously into LF-week-old Wistar-King rats. The implanted pellets were removed at 1-4 weeks and analyzed for bone and cartilage formation by histological and biochemical methods. Results: BMP-induced bone and cartilage induction was highly dependent on the geometric properties of the carrier. Some carriers such as porous particles or blocks of hydroxyapatite induced osteogenesis directly, without detectable chondrogenesis, whereas other carriers such as fibrous glass membrane induced cartilage exclusively. Still other carriers induced mostly cartilage followed by bone formation. Solid particles of hydroxyapatite and fibrous glass membrane with too tight a meshwork did not induce bone or cartilage. The optimal pore size for bone-forming efficacy in porous blocks of hydroxyapatite was a diameter of 300-400 mum. In straight tunnel structures with various diameters in honeycomb-shaped hydroxyapatite, tunnels with smaller diameters (90-120 mum) induced cartilage followed by bone formation, whereas those with larger diameters (350 mum) induced bone formation directly within the tunnels. Conclusions: BMP carriers were classified into three types: bone-inducing, cartilage-inducing, and cartilage-bone-inducing. From the analysis of causative factors inducing osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in the BMP system, we concluded that the geometry of the carrier is crucially important and vasculature-inducing geometry should be considered in designing effective scaffolds for bone formation. We propose a classification of geometry of the artificial extracellular matrices that is useful for designing a scaffold for tissue engineering of bone and related tissues. Clinical Relevance: Conventional requisites of the BMP carriers for clinical use have mainly concerned the affinities of carriers with cells and biomolecules and their mechanical strength. The vasculature-inducing geometry of carriers adds a new criterion in designing systems for effective bone and joint reconstruction. The geometries of porous structures-their sizes, continuity, and straightness as verified by hydroxyapatite in this study-will be applicable for other biomaterials for clinical reconstruction therapy.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Dent Sci, Dept Oral Hlth Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan","Kuboki, Y (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Dent Sci, Dept Oral Hlth Sci, Kita Ku, N-13,W-7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan.",,,,,,,31,188,207,4,34,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

In this review, we compare the osteoinductive effects of different biomaterial delivery systems that have or have not been pretreated with BMPs/OPs. In particular, we focus on the geometric induction of bone formation by sintered porous hydroxyapatite (SPHA) discs with concavities on their planar surfaces, which elicit bone formation without exogenously applied BMPs/OPs. Methods: Heterotopic bone formation was examined by bilaterally implanting 100-mg pellets of a collagenous carrier containing BMPs/OPs in the rectus abdominis muscle of the adult baboon. Orthotopic bone formation was examined by implanting 1 g of a collagenous carrier containing BMPs/OPs into two full-thickness critical-sized 25-mm-diameter defects on each side of the calvaria of adult baboons. The BMPs/OPs whose effects were examined included recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1), recombinant human transforming growth factor-pr (rhTGF-beta1), rhTGF-beta2, and porcine platelet derived transforming growth factor-beta1 (pTGF-beta1). Tissue from the rectus abdominis muscle was harvested 30 or 90 days after implantation. Tissue from the orthotopic calvarial model was examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after implantation. To demonstrate the effect of surface geometry on bone induction, hydroxyapatite powders were sintered to form solid discs with a series of concavities on the planar surfaces of the SPHA discs. The discs were either pretreated with exogenous rhOP-1 or not treated with exogenous OF-1. They were then implanted heterotopically or orthotopically into calvarial defects. Bone formation was evaluated histologically in undecalcified sections stained with Goldner's trichrome stain or 0.1% toluidine blue. Results: Naturally derived BMPs/OPs or rhOP-1 in a collagenous carrier elicit heterotopic bone formation and the complete healing of 25-mm-diameter critical-sized defects by day 90 following implantation. Binary applications of TGF-beta1 together with rhOP-1 in the collagen carrier induced massive endochondral ossicles in heterotopic sites and bone formation in calvarial defects. pTGF-beta1, rhTGF-beta1, and rhTGF-beta2 are powerful inducers of heterotopic endochondral bone formation but elicit limited bone formation in calvarial defects. SPHA discs pretreated with rhOP-1 elicited extensive bone formation in both heterotopic and orthotopic sites. However, SPHA without rhOP-1 also elicited bone formation in heterotopic and orthotopic sites and complete healing of the calvarial defects. Conclusion: We have prepared SPHA discs with concavities on their planar surfaces that induce bone formation in heterotopic or orthotopic critical-sized calvarial defects without exogenously applied BMPs/OPs. This biomaterial induces bone formation by intrinsic osteoinductivity regulated by the geometry of the substratum. The incorporation of specific biological activities into biomaterials by manipulating the geometry of the substratum, defined as geometric induction of bone formation, may make it possible to engineer morphogenetic responses for therapeutic osteogenesis in clinical contexts. Clinical Relevance: We have implemented a clinical trial using naturally derived BMPs/OPs extracted and purified from bovine bone matrices and implanted in craniofacial defects in humans. In addition, the discovery that specific geometric and surface characteristics of sintered hydroxyapatites can induce intrinsic osteoinductivity in primates paves the way for formulation and therapeutic application of porous substrata designed to obtain predictable intrinsic osteoinductivity in clinical contexts.","Univ Witwatersrand, MRC, Bone Res Unit, Sch Med, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, MRC, Bone Res Unit, Sch Med, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,60,43,46,1,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

In combination with biomaterials, these proteins can be used in a clinical setting as bone-graft substitutes to promote bone repair. Collagen from animal sources has previously been the preferred carrier material in animal experiments. More recently, synthetic biodegradable polymers have been tested as a delivery vehicle for osteoinductive agents. In earlier studies performed in our laboratory, it was found that the polylactic acid homopolymers (PLA650) and poly-D,L-lactic acid-polyethylene glycol block copolymers (PLA650-PEG200) are viscous liquids that can be used as BMP delivery systems. Methods: To obtain new PLA-PEG polymers that exhibit greater plasticity, the molecular sizes of PLA and PEG segments in the copolymer chains were increased. Plastic PLA-PEG polymers with various molecular sizes and PLA/PEG ratios were synthesized, mixed with recombinant human (rh) BMP-2, and implanted into the dorsal muscles of mice for 3 weeks to evaluate their capacity to elicit new bone formation. To compare the plastic PLA-PEG polymer with the liquid PLA650-PEG200 polymer, these two polymers were combined with rhBMP-2, implanted, and harvested after 3 weeks. Bone mineral content (BMC), bone area, and bone mineral density (BMD) of the ectopic new bone were measured by means of single energy X-ray absorptiometry (SXA). Results: All of the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 implants with 10 or 20 mug of rhBMP-2 showed new bone formation. In contrast, little or no bone formation was seen in other plastic PLA-PEG implants with rhBMP-2. Control implants that lacked rhBMP-2 did not show new bone formation. Radiographic and histologic examinations showed that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 implants with rhBMP-2 harvested 3 weeks after implantation had normal bone characteristics with hematopoietic marrow and osseous trabeculae. SXA analysis showed that the values for bone mineral content (BMC), bone area, and bone mineral density (BMD) of new bone resulting from the use of plastic PLA6,500-PEG3,000 polymers with rhBMP-2 were significantly higher than those obtained with the liquid PLA650-PEG200 polymers (p < 0.001 for each of the three values). Conclusions: These results indicate that the PLA6,500-PEG3000 block copolymer with plastic properties works effectively as a BMP delivery system. These data suggest that the total molecular size and ratio of PLA size to PEG size is an essential factor in determining the efficacy of a BMP delivery system. After implantation, it is possible that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 pellets might have absorbed tissue fluids and become swollen, resulting in bone formation that exceeded the size of the original implants. This expansion characteristic is a potentially beneficial property, given the intended practical application of the polymer in the repair of bone defects.

Biomaterials used in delivery systems also play a critical role in supporting the osteoinductive activity of BMPs, attributable to the controlled presentation of the BMPs to target cells. Despite extensive preclinical studies, the factors contributing to local rhBMP pharmacokinetics remain to be elucidated. Methods: The rhBMP pharmacokinetics were studied in a rat subcutaneous implant and in an intramuscular injection model. In situ levels of rhBMPs were quantitated with use of I-125-labeled tracers. The effects of protein structural features and the nature of the biomaterial implant were explored. Osteoinduction by biomaterial+rhBMP combinations was assessed by a semiquantitative, histology-based bone score. Results: With the use of rhBMP-2, rhBMP-4, and an N truncated rhBMP-2, the protein isoelectric point was found critical for the initial retention of rhBMPs in an implant. Osteoinduction studies carried out in parallel indicated that rhBMPs with a higher implant retention elicited more bone formation. In the clinically used collagen+rhBMP-2 device, collagen crosslinking and sterilization were most influential in rhBMP-2 retention. To increase retention at an application site, thermoreversible polymers were engineered and shown to enhance local rhBMP-2 retention, especially by injectable delivery. Conclusions: Two critical components of an osteoinductive device-namely, the biomaterial and the rhBMP-were shown to influence local protein pharmacokinetics and osteoinductive activity of the device. Designer biomaterials can provide an additional mechanism to modulate local protein pharmacokinetics. Clinical Relevance: These studies form the foundation of next-generation osteoinductive devices with improved potency at sites of desired bone regeneration and reduced side effects at other sites.","Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Biomed Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada; Genet Inst Inc, Biopharmaceut Characterizat & Anal Grp, Andover, MA 01810 USA; Genet Inst Inc, Bone Biol & Applicat Grp, Andover, MA 01810 USA; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Uludag, H (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Biomed Engn, 1098 EDC Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada.",,,,,,,23,143,148,0,7,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0021-9355,,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

But the high solubility of these materials limits their application. The addition of alumina can be used to control their solubility, but may inhibit the bonding mechanisms. In this paper, we study a bioglass in the SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5-K2O-Al2O3-MgO system. After delays of implantation from 2 to 12 months, the bioglass/bone interface is characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Bioglass dissolution can be decomposed into three steps with selective leaching. Results show that, at 2 months after implantation, the bioglass is composed of Al, Si, Ca, and P. Alumina addition increases the coating stability without inhibiting the bonding process. Complex physicochemical reactions take place at the bioglass periphery. The coating bonds to bone through a Ca-P layer on top of a pure Si-rich layer. These phenomena are associated with bioactivity properties, which occur for up to 6 months. After 12 months, the bioglass is composed of silicon, (C) 2001 Academic Press.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 02, France; Lab Phys Corpusculaire Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IN2P3, F-63177 Aubiere, France","Jallot, E (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader,BP 138, F-51685 Reims 02, France.",,,,,,,20,23,24,0,4,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0021-9797,,,J COLLOID INTERF SCI,J.

Phosphorylation was therefore envisaged as the means to enhance cellulose bioactivity. Once implanted, phosphorylated cellulose could promote the formation of calcium phosphates, having therefore closer resemblance to bone functionality and assuring a satisfactory bonding at the interface between hard tissue and biomaterial. In the present work, regenerated cellulose hydrogels were surface modified via phosphorylation. Phosphorylated materials, having varying degrees of substitution, were soaked in a Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution in order to investigate their ability to induce the formation of a calcium phosphate layer. Mineralization was assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the calcium salt of cellulose phosphates mineralized at a higher extent than materials only phosphorylated. The degree of phosphorylation influenced the extent of surface mineralization. Moderate degrees of surface phosphorylation promoted the highest extent of mineralization. This was attributed to inadequate functionality of the surface in terms of density of PO4 groups and overall surface charge, in the case of low and high phosphate contents.

However, the lack of a reproducible in vitro method that simulates clinical use makes it difficult to evaluate the lubricity of urinary catheters and other devices for urethral insertion. Therefore, this study describes a suitable method based on use of a Texture Analyzer to characterize the lubricity of such devices. The novel method was susequently applied to the evaluation of commercially-available intermittent urinary catheters. In addition, other important physicochemical properties of these catheters were examined, namely Young's modulus, degree of hydration and morphology. Catheter lubricity was quantified, using a Texture Analyzer, by measurement of the forces required for insertion and removal of the device from two model substrates, agar and mucin-coated silicone tubing. Significant differences in lubricity were identified between the commercially-available catheters, with Aquacath and Lofric exhibiting the lowest forces of insertion and removal. There were no significant differences between the extent of hydration between the catheters, with the exception of Uro-flo which exhibited the lowest hydration. Therefore, the differences in lubricity were not directly related to the extent of hydration. The forces required for insertion/removal of all catheters were markedly greater in the simulated mucin model than in the agar substrate and the former, simulated urethra model, was accepted to mimic more accurately, the in vivo situation. Significant differences were observed between the Young's Moduli of the catheter biomaterials, with Aquacath possessing the largest value. In conclusion, this study has described the use of a texture analyzer and polymeric substrates for the evaluation of biomaterial lubricity. Using these methods, Aquacath and Lofric catheters exhibited greatest lubricity. However, following additional consideration of the mechanical properties of these biomaterials, Aquacath possessed the most appropriate physicochemical properties for use in intermittent catheterization.

The UV-induced graft copolymerization of PEGMA onto the plasma-pretreated NR latex films was also explored with PEGMA of different macromonomer concentrations and with different UV graft copolymerization time. The surface microstructures and compositions of the PEG-modified NR latex films were characterized by contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. In general, higher macromonomer concentration and longer UV graft copolymerization time led to a higher graft yield. Water contact angle measurements revealed that the hydrophilicity of the NR latex film surface was greatly enhanced by the grafting of the PEG chains. The NR surface with a high density of grafted PEG was very effective in reducing protein adsorption and platelet adhesion. A lower graft concentration of the high-molecular-weight PEG was more effective than a high graft concentration of the low-molecular-weight PEG in reducing protein adsorption and platelet adhesion.

The two tested biomaterials were implanted in distal femoral osseous defects in rabbits. Qualitative and quantitative histological evaluation was performed three and eight weeks after implantation to investigate bone colonization and ceramic biodegradation associated with the two bone substitutes. Both biomaterials expressed osteoconduction properties and supported the apposition of a well-mineralized lamellar newly-formed bone. Bone colonization occurred much earlier and faster for IBS than for MBCP implants, although the respective rates of newly-formed bone after eight weeks of implantation did not differ significantly. For both biomaterials, ceramic resorption occurred regularly throughout the implantation period, though to a greater extent with IBS than with MBCP implants. The associated polymer in IBS produced intergranular spaces allowing body fluids to reach each BCP ceramic granule immediately after implantation, which may have favored osteoblastic activity, new bone formation and ceramic resorption. This completely interconnected open macroporosity could account for the earlier and more satisfactory bone substitution achieved with IBS.

Furthermore, growth in 5% v/v CO2 decreased the adherence of C. tropicalis and C. albicans to both PVC and silicone, however, increased adherence of C. krusei (p <0.05). Pre-treatment of the microorganisms with pooled human saliva significantly decreased their cell surface hydrophobicity and increased their adherence to either biomaterial in comparison to yeast cells that had been pre-treated with PBS (p <0.05). Saliva treatment of the microorganisms had no consistent effect on microbial zeta potential. Interestingly, adherence of the three, saliva-treated Candida spp. to saliva-treated silicone and PVC was significantly lower than whenever the microorganisms and biomaterials had been treated with PBS (p <0.05). Treatment of silicone and PVC with saliva significantly altered the surface properties, notably reducing both the advancing and receding contact angles and, additionally, the microrugosity. These effects may contribute to the decreased adherence of saliva-treated microorganisms to these biomaterials. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the effects of physiological conditions within the oral cavity on the adherence of selected Candida spp. to biomaterials employed as oropharyngeal medical devices. In particular, this study has ominously shown that these materials act as substrates for yeast colonization, highlighting the need for advancements in biomaterial design. Furthermore, it is important that physiological conditions should be employed whenever biocompatibility of oropharyngeal biomaterials is under investigation.

The combination of good mechanical properties of this material and the excellent biocompatibility, the good wear and corrosion behavior of an outer alpha -alumina layer, limiting the release of ionic species and wear debris from the bulk material into the body-fluid environment, can make this material a candidate alloy for medical applications. Isothermal oxidation at 1100 degreesC in air of the alloy has led to the formation of a fine-grained, compact and adherent alpha -alumina scale. Oxide nodules rich in Ti, Y, Cr, and Fe were found on the top of the surface. In vitro electrochemical corrosion experiments showed good protective properties of the oxide scale. Moreover, no spallation of the alumina layer was observed. This feature is significant considering that the alumina layer has to withstand very high compressive stresses resulting from both growth and thermal stresses incorporated during cooling.

The synthetic hydrogels are known as poorly adhesive surfaces. In this study we demonstrated the adsorption of albumin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and epidermal growth factor to poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) and copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and potassium salt of 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate (SPMAK). The adhesion and growth of 3T3 cells and human keratinocytes on surface of these polymers was tested without and with pretreatment of polymers with heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor. The adhesion of mixture of human granulocytes and monocytes to these surfaces was also tested. The strips of both polymers were subcutaneously and intracerebrally implanted into the rat and the extent of foreign body reaction and brain biocompatibility was evaluated. The results showed the extensive adsorption of basic fibroblast growth factor and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor to copolymer containing SPMAK. However the adhesion (and growth) of cells to this type of copolymers was very low. Preadsorption of human plasma to pHEMA clearly stimulated the leukocyte adhesion in contrary to copolymer containing SPMAK. The extent of foreign-body reaction was significantly higher against the pHEMA compared to tested copolymer p(HEMA-co-SPMAK). In conclusion, the tested copolymer was a poorly adhesive substrate that is only poorly recognized by the non-specific immunity, although the adsorption of basic growth factors to this substrate is highly significant. Both polymers were well tolerated by the brain tissue. The phenotype of surrounding neurons was more close to the control neurons in the brain tissue surrounding the p(HEMA-co-SPMAK) implants.

In this work biomimetic coatings consisting either of collagen type I (for the gingiva region) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) or mineralized collagen (for the bone interface) have been developed as suitable surfaces regarding the interfaces. Additionally, using these biomimetic coatings as a matrix, adhesion peptides were bound to further increase the specificity of titanium implant surfaces. To enhance cell attachment in the gingiva region, a linear adhesion peptide developed from a laminin sequence (TWYKIAFQRNRK) was bound to collagen, whereas for the bone interface, a cyclic RGD peptide was bound to HAP and mineralized collagen using adequate anchor systems. The biological potential of these coatings deduced from cell attachment experiments with HaCaT human keratinocytes and MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts showed the best results for collagen and laminin sequence coating for the gingiva region and mineralized collagen and RGD peptide coatings for regions with bone contact. Our concept opens promising approaches to improve the biological integration of dental implants.

Complement activation is known to occur and induce unspecific inflammation around the biomaterials. Human vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu), two potent inhibitors of complement, can be bound by CoNS. With a hypothesis whether binding of Vn or Clu influences complement activation, two measurements were determined. For Vn, complement activation was measured with a mouse anti-activated human C9 antibody. In the presence of Vn-binding strain, Staphylococcus hemolyticus SM13I, complement activation on a surface pre-coated with Vn occurred as it did in the absence of Vn pre-coating. For S. epidermidis 3380, which does not express binding of Vn, complement activation on a Vn-presented surface was significantly decreased. For Clu, erythrocytes lysis was measured to reflect the end product of complement activation (membrane attack complex). The complement-induced hemolysis increased when human serum was pre-incubated with Clu-binding strains, S. epidermidis J9P. The enhancement of hemolysis by J9P decreased when serum was supplemented by exogenous Clu. The data imply that interaction between CoNS and Vn or Clu interferes with one of their physiological functions, complement inhibition.

To overcome these problems, we are developing a ""composite enterocystoplasty"" procedure to replace the epithelium of the bowel with autologous in vitro-propagated normal urothelial cells. The aims of this study were to evaluate synthetic biomaterials as delivery vehicles for the cultured urothelial cells and provide support during transfer and cell adherence to the de-epithelialized bowel wall. The surgical compliance of 12 biomaterials was evaluated, along with their ability to support urothelial cell attachment. Transfer of urothelial cells onto biomaterials as single cell suspensions or intact cell sheets was investigated. Seeding of a single cell suspension on to non-woven mesh resulted in poor cell attachment. Seeding onto woven mesh was more efficient, but the most effective transfer method involved producing an intact cell sheet that could be combined with woven, knitted and non-woven biomaterials. Transfer of the cell sheet : mesh complexes onto a de-epithelialized bladder stroma produced a stratified epithelium incorporating the strands of the mesh and expressing urothelial-associated antigens after 48 h in organ culture. Thus, we have developed and evaluated a suitable transfer method for in vitro propagated urothelial cells to be used in ""composite enterocystoplasty"".

However, the precise effects of therapeutic US on tissue healing processes are not clearly understood, although they are likely to involve changes in key cellular functions. The present study has therefore examined the effects of several US intensity levels on the activity of two bone-associated proteins, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteopontin (OP) in a human cell line, MG63, using RT-PCR. ALP showed progressively higher expression with increasing US intensities, whereas OP responded differently, showing down-regulation at 120 mW/cm(2), the lowest US exposure. OP expression was considerably less affected overall compared with the relative response of ALP to the same US doses. The results show that there is a differential response to therapeutic levels of US, since ALP and OP clearly exhibited gene-specific response profiles. These findings suggest that modifying the parameters of US exposure could be used to improve repair and regeneration processes and enhance the clinical efficacy of implanted biomaterials for tissue engineering.

Certain compositions of ceramics, glasses, glass ceramics and composites have shown bone bonding behaviour. These materials have become known as bioactive ceramics. A common characteristic of bioactive ceramics is a time-dependent, kinetic modification of the surface that occurs upon implantation.

The Cavendish Laboratory's Multiple Impact Jet Apparatus (MIJA) is able to simulate high velocity rain impact accurately and reproducibly under laboratory conditions using a series of discrete, carefully controlled water jets. Traditionally, quantitative erosion data in the form of Damage Threshold Velocity (DTV) curves are obtained, particularly for ceramic materials and glasses. These curves enable direct comparison of material strength, and can be sensitive enough to distinguish different preparation and polishing processes. However, current research into nanocomposites for the aerospace industry has prompted a reassessment of damage criteria. One of the emerging areas of interest in materials for aerospace applications is mimicking natural structures such as abalone nacre with a view to creating them synthetically for use in environmentally tough environments. This paper presents high speed liquid impact, and related data, on contrasting, natural structures - cross-lamellar and nacreous structures.

The porous titanium foam is characterized by image analyses, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties are investigated by compressive tests. These biocompatible porous titanium foams with a porosity of 80% and pore size between 200500 mum are expected to be used as biomaterial candidate for bone implants because its open-cellular structure permits the ingrowths of new-bone tissues and the transport of the body fluids.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Struct & Engn Mat, Kita Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4628510, Japan","Wen, CE (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Struct & Engn Mat, Kita Ku, 1-1 Hirate Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4628510, Japan.",,"Chino, Yasumasa/L-9782-2018","Chino, Yasumasa/0000-0002-0725-8237",,,,10,0,0,0,1,SCIENCE PRESS,MONMOUTH JUNCTION,"2031 US HIGHWAY 130 STE F, MONMOUTH JUNCTION, NJ 08852-3014 USA",,,1-880132-79-6,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,552,556,,,,,,5,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Mechanics,BU28J,WOS:000175560700129,,,,,2019-02-25

A 20-channel implant of the second generation type for mobilisation of paraplegics and an 8-channel implant of the third generation type for cardiac assist have been tested in animal studies. A device of completely new design for direct stimulation of denervated muscles is being tested in animal studies. There is a limited choice of technologically suitable biocompatible and bioresistant materials for implants. The physical design has to be anatomically shaped without corners or edges. Electrical conductors carrying direct current (D.C.) have to be placed inside a hermetic metal case. The established sealing materials, silicone rubber and epoxy resin, do not provide hermeticity and should only embed DC-free components. For electrical connections outside the hermetic metal case welding is preferable to soldering; conductive adhesives should be avoided. it is advisable to use a hydrophobic oxide ceramic core for telemetry antenna coils embedded in sealing polymer. Cleaning of all components before sealing in resin is of the utmost importance as well as avoidance of rapid temperature changes during the curing process. (C) 2001 IPEM.

At 90 days post-implantation, the animals were euthanized, and the ceramic devices, the fibrous tissue, and vital organs were harvested. Evaluation of routine stained sections (5 mum, hematoxylin & eosin) of the fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the HA and ALCAP ceramics revealed the following: 1) all the ceramic devices had fibrous connective tissue capsules of slightly varying degrees of thickness at the time of sacrifice, depending on the site of implantation and type of material, and 2) there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the numbers and types of cellular components with respect to implantation site. The number of macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts, degree of vascularity, and thickness of the fibrous tissue matrix was found to be statistically different between the SIC implanted ceramic groups.

When blood comes into contact with these so-called biomaterials, an inappropriate inflammatory response, which can be life-threatening in some patients, may develop. The reason for this inappropriate activation of host defence mechanisms is not entirely clear, however a number of strategies have evolved over the years to minimize this unwanted sequelae of CPB. These strategies include surface coating of the materials of the circuit, using new materials thought to improve biocompatibility, and using a number of pharmacological interventions designed to suppress the inflammatory response. Recently, there has been some evidence which indicates that the plasticizer employed in the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing of the CPB circuit may play a part in the development of the inflammatory response. The work described in this paper tends to support this thesis. These studies showed that by washing the plasticizer from the surface of the PVC tubing, the biocompatibility, as reflected in the upregulation of CID11b on the surface of neutrophils, was enhanced. Furthermore, the use of non-plasticized substitutes for PVC had a similar effect. The benefit from removing the plasticizer was similar to that gained from surface coating with heparin, one of the conventional approaches to reducing the inflammatory response to CPB.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London W12 0NN, England","Gourlay, T (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, Hammersmith Hosp Campus,Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",,,,,,,31,22,24,0,2,"ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC",LONDON,"338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON NW1 3BH, ENGLAND",0267-6591,,,PERFUSION-UK,Perfusion-UK,,2001.0,16,5,,,,,381,390,,10.1177/026765910101600508,,,,10,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,471BB,WOS:000170906000007,11565893.0,,,,2019-02-25

Materials such as stainless-steel, titanium and vitalium alloys have been the used more frequently, particularly in maxillo-facial implants for head & neck oncological patients. When radiotherapy treatments are recommended, two factors must be taken into consideration, in the treatment protocol: beam attenuation and scattering in the prosthesis material. In most cases the target volume for irradiation is an heterogeneous medium with soft biological tissue and metallic biomaterial. Although some work has been done in this filed, the influence of the prostheses during the irradiation process is still an open question. The main goal of this study is to develop some experimental work in order to understand, and quantify the influence of attenuation of radiation beam and scattering effects, in the dose delivered to the target volume and surrounding tissues. From the experimental data analysis, conclusions about benefits and risks that arise during radiotherapy treatments in those conditions are drawn. The first part of this study involved the characterization of the implant composition, using nuclear techniques. Afterwards, dosimetric studies were performed in an acrylic phantom in order to evaluate the perturbation caused by the prosthesis in the dose distribution in the target tissues surrounding the implant.","Inst Portugues Oncol Francisco Gentil, Dept Radioterapia, Lisbon, Portugal; EST&ST, Escola Super Technol Saude, Lisbon, Portugal; Inst Tecnol & Nucl, Sacavem, Portugal",,,"Alves, Eduardo/K-2481-2013","Alves, Eduardo/0000-0003-0633-8937",,,,37,0,0,0,2,ISTITUTI EDITORIALI E POLGRAFICI INTERNAZIONALI,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",1120-1797,,,PHYS MEDICA,Phys.

The evolution of the material structure was followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The degradation solutions were monitored with anionic chromatography (HPAE-PAD), colorimetric methods, and Fourier transformed infra-red spectrophotomety (FT-IR) in order to quantify the amount of plasticisers and sugars. SEVA-C micrographs presented an increase in the surface porosity as a function of immersion time.

They are also critical in polymer-supported heterogeneous catalysis. This article reviews recent progress in experimental and simulation methods for generating, characterizing, and modeling polymer micro- and nano-particles in a number of polymer and polymer blend systems. A description of the use of gas atomization (of melts) and microdroplet (solution) approaches to generation and characterization of spherical polymer powders and microparticles represents their unique applications, giving the non-specialist reader a comprehensive overview. Using novel instrumentation developed for probing single fluorescent molecules in submicrometer droplets, it is demonstrated that polymer particles of nearly arbitrary size and composition can be made with uniform size dispersion. This interesting finding is ascribed to new dynamic behavior, which emerges when polymers are confined in a small droplet of solution the size of a molecule or molecular aggregates. Solvent evaporation takes place on a time scale short enough to frustrate phase separation, producing dry pure polymer or polymer blend microparticles that have tunable properties and that are homogeneous within molecular dimensions. In addition, it shows how a number of optical methodologies such as Fraunhofer diffraction can be used to probe polymer particles immobilized on two-dimensional substrates or levitated in space using a three-dimensional quadrupole (Paul) trap. Unlike conventional methods such as electron-beam microscopy, the optical diffraction methods provide a unique look inside a polymer particle in a measurement time scale of a few milliseconds, making it attractive to in-line production applications. In particular, it shows that it is possible to use computational neural networks, extensive classical trajectory calculations (i.e., classical molecular dynamics methods) in conjunction with experiments to gain deeper insights into the structure and properties of the polymer microparticles. Overall, it is possible to use the new understanding of phase separation to produce a number of useful, scientifically interesting homogeneous polymer blends from bulk-immiscible components in solution. Additionally, this new knowledge provides useful guidelines for future experimental studies and theory development of polymer and polymer blend micro- and nano-particles, which are not widely studied.","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem & Analyt Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Otaigbe, JU (reprint author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,"Suter, Ulrich/H-8900-2013; Sumpter, Bobby/C-9459-2013","Suter, Ulrich/0000-0001-7467-7346; Sumpter, Bobby/0000-0001-6341-0355",,,,239,20,20,3,58,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,,,2001.0,154,,,,,,1,86,,,,,,86,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,BS45B,WOS:000169892100001,,,,,2019-02-25

The regenerated surface oxide film in Hanks' solution was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Phosphate ions are preferentially taken up in the surface film during regeneration and the film consists of titanium oxide and titanium phosphate. Calcium ions and phosphate ions are adsorbed to the film after regeneration and calcium phosphate or calcium titanium phosphate is formed at the outermost surface. Ions constituting Hanks' solution other than calcium and phosphate were absent from the surface oxide. In the case of titanium and Ti-6Al-4V, calcium phosphate was formed on/in the surface oxide film regenerated in Hanks' solution. However, Ti-56Ni and Ti-60Zr did not form calcium phosphate on themselves, but formed phosphate.

In this study, change in this GJIC function of cells contacting with various microspheres prepared from biomaterials was estimated using different methods. It was observed that microspheres pre-coated before test cell adhesion inhibited the function more than those added after cell adhesion. In addition, the inhibition levels were affected by amounts, diameter, composition and time period of interaction of microspheres as well as cell type used in the study. These findings suggest that not only the way for cells to recognize the microspheres but also characteristics of the microspheres are important factors affecting the GJIC function. Interaction of microspheres with osteoblasts resulted in inhibition of their differentiation, indicating microspheres are probable to disturb both cell differentiation and the GJIC function of the cells.

The testing was conducted in air at room temperature under conditions of frequency, f, =10, stress rate, R, =0.1, and a normal clamping pressure of about 30MP, using dogbone-shaped specimens and bridge-type pads with flat feet. Fretting greatly reduces the fatigue life and strength for both alloys under the normal stress of 30MPa. The fretting-fatigue strengths of the alloys are dramatically lower than their plain-fatigue strength. Under the participation of the fretting, the fatigue strengths of Ti-6Al4V ELI and Ti-6Al-7Nb are reduced respectively to be 350 MPa and 300 MPa from 700 MPa and 650 MPa, and that of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr is decreased to be 150 MPa from 380 MPa. The fretting scar consists intrinsically of fretted delaminations. Relatively, the delaminated degree of the beta alloy is not as heavy as that of the alpha+beta alloys. The fretting-fatigue cracking of the two alpha+beta titanium alloys happen near the stick/slip boundary, where a tensile surface stress concentration exists due to the static traction blocking the deformation of this region, but the pure beta alloy cracks near the edge of the contact (EOC) where the amplitude of the micro slip and the traction are maximum and hence the worn degree is also believed to be maximum. In the alpha+beta alloys surface cracks concentrate at-edges of every delamination in the fretted areas, but in the beta alloy cracks are found mainly near the EOC. The angle of the crack propagation to the specimen surface and the fracture features of fretting fatigue are apparently different from those of plain fatigue for the alpha+beta titanium alloys, and the fretting-induced feature on the fracture pattern of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr is not remarkable. The dramatic reduction of the fatigue strength and life of the alpha+beta alloys and the beta alloy under fretting is explained.","Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Nagoya 4648650, Japan","Fukui, H (reprint author), Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Nagoya 4648650, Japan.",,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"AOBA ARAMAKI, SENDAI, 980, JAPAN",,,4-88903-404-8,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,205,208,,,,,,4,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BV26R,WOS:000178391600051,,,,,2019-02-25

Recently, a new 0 type titanium alloy, Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr, composed of non-toxic elements was designed and developed for biomedical applications. Fretting fatigue failure is highly possible to occur for biomedical instruments in vivo. Under fretting fatigue conditions, fatigue crack tends to initiate much faster than that under plain fatigue conditions, and initiates, for example, at friction area between stem and bone cement in artificial hip joints. Fretting and plain fatigue characteristics of the new alloy were investigated with relating microstructure in comparison with those of conventional biomedical alpha+beta titanium alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb. Fretting and plain fatigue limits in air, sigma(wf) and sigma(wp), of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr conducted with solution treatment are around 200 MPa and 400 MPa, respectively. The ratio of fretting fatigue to plain fatigue limit, sigma(wf)/sigma(wp), of the new alloy is obviously greater than those of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb. The fretting fatigue strength of Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr conducted with solution treatment in Ringer's solution is nearly equal to that in air in high cycle fatigue region because the frictional force decreases and fretting fatigue crack initiation is accelerated due to the formation of corrosion pits in Ringer's solution.","Toyohashi Univ Technol, Dept Prod Syst Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan","Akahori, T (reprint author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, Dept Prod Syst Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan.",,,,,,,6,3,3,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"AOBA ARAMAKI, SENDAI, 980, JAPAN",,,4-88903-404-8,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,209,212,,,,,,4,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BV26R,WOS:000178391600052,,,,,2019-02-25

After that the compact was immersed in aqueous solution of CaO. 2) The powders were mixed with CaO particles, and sintered by SPS. 3) The powders were immersed in aqueous solution of CaO. The powders with the surface modification were sintered by SPS.

In order to treat this natural variability, statistical techniques need to be applied to model thermal process operations in foods and biological products. Stochastic approaches can be used to incorporate the probabilistic nature of the properties of food and biological products as well as thermal processes into the mathematical formulations. This work developed and implemented a stochastic perturbation-based finite element approach for thermal process operations and provided outputs in terms of meaningful statistics as mean temperature values and variances.

Based on the effect of biomaterials on cells growth, some ideas were put forward, e.g. biomimetic modification of biomaterials surface for improving cells affinity, carbohydrate cluster, glycolipid and protein modifying biomaterials surface in order to enhance cells specificity recognition, self-assembly of materials to modify surface topography.","Tianjin Univ, Res Inst Polymer Mat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Cai, KY (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Res Inst Polymer Mat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",,"Cai, Kaiyong/B-3061-2012; 蔡, 开勇/G-1233-2011",,,,,102,3,4,4,25,CHINESE ACAD SCIENCES,BEIJING,"NO. 8 KEXUEYUANNANLU, ZHONGGUANCUN, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1005-281X,,,PROG CHEM,Prog.

Higher temperature TSDC spectra (250 to 350 K) provided the alpha relaxation peaks associated with the glass transition temperature. The direct signal analysis (DSA) method allowed the decomposition of the complex peaks into elementary processes. The beta(i) components result from localized motions of molecular segments of variable length molecules whose identities were established in a prior study of polycarbonates.

This ESR peak intensity in DAp with collagen (c-DAp) decreased in an increase in the amount of collagen added into Ca(H2PO4)(2)H2O (MCP) electrolytic solution, because dangling H+ of HPO42- binds to the carboxyl group of collagen due to the hydrogen bond. The ESR signal intensities at near g = 2 in DAp, c-DAp, and stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HAp) after X ray irradiation, were proportional to the absorbed dose in the range from 6 to 380 Gy. These ESR signal intensities decreased when the X ray-irradiated DAp, c-DAp, and HAp was suspended in the simulated body fluid. This fact suggests that the surface layer contained high density of ESR active species in DAp, c-DAp. and HAp dissolved in the simulated body fluid.

The fretting-fatigue limits of the alloys are dramatically lower than their plain-fatigue limits. The contact areas are fretted heavily, and every scar consists of a stick region in the middle and two slip regions beside. Lots of surface cracks exist in the fretted areas. The dramatic reduction of fatigue life is ascribed to the increased stress intensity factor of the crack in early stage due to the cooperative action of alternating bulk stress, frictional force and normal stress under fretting condition. The fracture features and the angle of the crack propagation to the specimen surface of fretting fatigue are different from those of plain fatigue.","Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648650, Japan","Fukui, H (reprint author), Aichi Gakuin Univ, Dept Dent Mat Sci, Chikusa Ku, 1-100 Kusumoto Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648650, Japan.",,,,,,,11,1,1,0,5,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-487-9,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,107,114,,,,,,8,"Materials Science, Biomaterials",Materials Science,BS16A,WOS:000168874700012,,,,,2019-02-25

The austenitic structure of this alloy is maintained by a high nitrogen content of approximately one percent. Besides austenitic stability, the high nitrogen content also contributes to high levels of corrosion resistance and strength. The corrosion resistance and strength properties of BioDur 108 Alloy are compared to several nickel-containing austenitic stainless alloys that have been used as biomaterials. The strength of such alloys tends to be dominated by nitrogen content, while corrosion resistance is strongly related to the combined contents of chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen. However, the quantitative effect of nitrogen variations on the corrosion resistance observed in high nitrogen alloys is significantly different than in alloys with lower nitrogen levels. In addition, the high manganese content of high nitrogen alloys affects the corrosion characteristics in certain tests, in particular the passive current density measured during potentiodynamic corrosion testing at rapid scan rates. However, it was found that the passive current densities of high nitrogen high manganese alloys quickly decay to the levels of the comparative alloys in potentiostatic current decay tests and in potentiodynamic tests at slower scan rates.","Carpenter Technol Corp, Reading, PA USA","Gebeau, RC (reprint author), Carpenter Technol Corp, Reading, PA USA.",,,,,,,15,1,2,1,1,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-487-9,,,,2001.0,,,,,,,157,164,,,,,,8,"Materials Science, Biomaterials",Materials Science,BS16A,WOS:000168874700018,,,,,2019-02-25

Within the body, gas-solid interactions become relatively less significant and solid-liquid or solid-solid interfaces dominate, providing new challenges for the surface scientist. The current paper aims to provide a timely review of the use of surface analysis and modification techniques within the biomaterials field. A broad overview of applications in a number of related areas is given with particular attention focusing on those materials commonly encountered in dentistry and oral or maxillofacial implantology. Several specific issues of current interest are discussed. The interaction between synthetic and natural solids, both in the oral environment and elsewhere in the body is important in terms of adhesion, related stresses and strains and ultimately the longevity of a dental restoration, biomedical implant, or indeed the surrounding tissue. Exposure to body fluids, of course, can also affect stability, leading to the degradation or corrosion of materials within the body. Whilst this could potentially be harmful, e.g., if cytotoxic elements are released, it may alternatively provide a route to the preferential release of beneficial substances. Furthermore, in some cases, the controlled disintegration of a biomaterial is desirable, allowing the removal of an implant, e.g., without the need for further surgery, The presence of cells in the immediate bioenvironment additionally complicates the situation. A considerable amount of current research activity is targeted at the development of coatings or surface treatments to encourage tissue growth. Lf this is to be achieved by stimulating enhanced cell productivity, determination of the relationship between cell function and surface composition is essential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cells cultured at 37 degreesC are harvested from the surfaces only by reducing temperature without trypsin due to the surface property change from relatively hydrophobic to hydrophilic, depending on temperature. Confluent cells are harvested as a single contiguous cell sheet. The harvested cell sheets are subjected to several applications such as cell sheet transplantation for capillary network formation and piling for the reconstruction of three-dimensional tissue architectures. By patterned grafting of smart polymers onto culture dish surfaces, novel patterned cell coculture was also achieved, which can be utilized for extracorporeal devices.

Although a periodontal connective tissue attachment offers distinct advantages, only osseointegration and fibro-osseous integration are at present clinically achievable. Recent studies indicate a periodontal regeneration-competent cell population and an appropriate biomaterial substrate both are required for periodontal connective attachment formation on biomaterial surfaces. We therefore have developed an in vitro model to characterize the effects of various biomaterial substrates on the early events of periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. Primary cultures of periodontal ligament and gingival connective tissue cells were cultured on uncoated (control) and coated (titanium- and hydroxyapatite-coated) tissue culture plastic, and the level of cell proliferation, collagen, and noncollagen protein synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity, and expression of a 42 kD cementum extracellular matrix protein were measured over 5, 7, and 9 days in culture. While all three substrates supported cell attachment, proliferation, and protein synthesis, only uncoated and titanium-coated tissue culture plastic supported expression of the cementum extracellular matrix protein after 9 days of culture. In addition, the levels of cell proliferation and collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis for cells grown on hydroxyapatite-coated surfaces lagged behind cells cultured on the control or titanium-coated surfaces at each of the three time points. These data suggest that biomaterial substrates markedly can influence the temporal sequence of extracellular matrix proteins associated with periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. In addition to surface composition (titanium versus hydroxyapatite), surface properties (e.g., topography) also may have an effect on periodontal connective tissue attachment formation. This model may be of use in designing biomaterials to support the formation of periodontal connective tissue attachment in vivo.

The experiments on the different samples are carried out using the same thermal history throughout the entire characterization process. The high-temperature current rise caused by the conductivity of the samples is studied with a simple model that utilizes an approximation of the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) relaxation time. The conductivity data is well reproduced except for temperatures well below the glass-transition temperature and for small currents. The glass-transition peak is modeled with a phenomenological expression valid near T-g, which is able to describe the glass relaxation with a minimum number of parameters. The conduction and the glass-transition relaxation are studied versus the structural changes for the different samples. It is found that the conductivity and the glass-transition temperature shift to lower temperatures as the methylene groups in the backbone increase. Furthermore, if the experimental data is presented as a function of the reduced temperature, the shape of the glass-transition relaxation for the different samples is independent of the polymer backbone length.

Mechanical testing of composite materials was performed using an Inova tensile/compression test machine. Bone/implant interaction and design parameters are also discussed. The structure of the TiNi alloy is modified in the casting process. Similar effects to those observed in the annealing process occurred in TiNi materials during casting and cooling of composites. The Ti-alloy matrix is composed of a mixture of cc and 13 phases. The interaction between the ceramic layer and the metallic components depends on the cooling rate in the casting process. Different reaction products were identified on the Al(2)O(3)/metal interface with dependence on the applied cooling rate of the composite. The fatigue life of the investigated composites is greater than 10(7) cycles, and mechanical properties are sufficient to carry loads expected in human medicine. A newly developed smart implant enables quasielastic fixation with an active role of bone tissue in load carrying process, which has a positive impact on treatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Optical characterization indicates a successful retention of protein conformation after encapsulation. The conformation retention is strongly correlated to both the rate of gelation and the subsequent drying speed. Using hemoglobin as a model protein, a higher colloidal solid concentration and a lower synthesis pH were found, both causing faster gelation, resulting in a better retention of conformation. Hemoglobin encapsulated in a thin film, which dries faster, also showed a better retention than in the bulk. This is attributed to the fact that when a protein is isolated, and especially when it is confined to a space close to its own dimensions, conformational changes are sterically hindered, hence the structural stability. Enzymatic activity of bovine liver catalase was also monitored and showed a remarkable improvement when encapsulated using the aqueous colloidal process, compared to using the conventional alkoxide-based process. Thus, the aqueous colloidal sol-gel process offers a promising alternative to the conventional sol-gel process for encapsulating biomolecules into transparent, porous matrices.

To design a biomedically useful polymer that is intrinsically infection-resistant, we have developed a ciprofloxacin-loaded polyurethane (PU) matrix that releases antibiotic locally at the implant surface, thereby minimizing bacterial accumulation. We report here the methods of fabrication and formulation for making such antibiotic-loaded devices, as well as evidence of their bactericidal properties. Specifically, various pore-forming agents and drug loadings were examined. An optimum formulation consisting of BIOSPAN(R) PU, poly(ethylene glycol) and ciprofloxacin offered the longest effective period of sustained release (5 days). The bactericidal efficacy of the released ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was four times that of the control PU without antibiotics. This bactericidal efficiency was due to an increase in the PA detachment from the surface. These observations suggested that the released ciprofloxacin was biologically active in preventing the bacteria from permanently adhering to the substratum, and thus decreasing the possibility of biofilm-related infection.

It is generally reported that the cytotoxicity of a chemical differs with cell lines. However, our previous study revealed a high correlation in the cytotoxicity of 43 metal salts between two murine cell Lines. If there is any generic tendency toward metal salt cytotoxicity for many kinds of cells, that information is helpful for the determination of the chemical composition of new metallic biomaterials that are expected to have lower cytotoxicity. In this study, the cytotoxicity of 12 metal salts was evaluated using four cell lines, and the results were compared, including those for two other cell lines obtained in our previous study. A metal salt concentration that reduced cell viability to 50% of that without any metal salt (IC50) was used as an index to compare the metal salt cytotoxicity between cell lines. The correlation was statistically proved by the IC(50)s of 12 metal salts among these cell Lines (p < 0.01), suggesting the existence of a generic tendency to metal salt cytotoxicity beyond cell lines. The metal salt order of toxicity from the highest was K2Cr2O7, AgNO3 VCl3, SbCl3,CuCl2,CoCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2,Cr(NO3)(3), FeCl3, TiCl4, and Al(NO3)(3).

Thus, lesions of this tissue are a pro-arthrotic factor, and up to now the conservative treatment of cartilage lesions and arthrosis does not yield satisfying results. Therefore, autologous transplantation of articular chondrocytes is being investigated in a variety of different assays. The aim of our study was to create a mechanically stable cell-matrix implant with viable and active chondrocytes which could serve to fill out articular lesions created in the knees of sheep. For this purpose, articular cartilage was collected from knee lesions, chondrocytes were liberated enzymatically and seeded in culture flasks and cultured till confluency. Cells were then trypsinized and grown on a type I/III collagen matrix (Chondro-Gide(TM) Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhusen, Switzerland) for 3, 6 and 10 days before being fixed and embedded for electron microscopy by routine methods. Scanning electron microscopy was performed after dehydration in acetone, critical point drying and sputter-coating with gold-paladium, Light microscopically, clusters of chondrocytes can be seen on the surface of the matrix with a few cells growing into the matrix. Transmission electron microscopic photographs yield a rather differentiated chondrocyte-like appearance, which is evidence of a matrix-induced redifferentiation after dedifferentiation during the growth period in the culture flasks. Scanning electron microscopic results show large, flattened chondrocytes without signs of differentiation on plastic, whereas chondrocytes grown on the Chondro-Gide(TM) sponge show a more roundish aspect wrapping firmly around the collagen fibrils, exhibiting numerous contacts with the matrix. This cell-matrix biocomposite can now serve to fill out articular cartilage lesions created in the knees of sheep.","Univ Lubeck, Inst Anat, Orthopad Klin, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; Univ Lubeck, Inst Med Mol Biol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany","Ehlers, EM (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, Inst Anat, Orthopad Klin, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.",,,,,,,9,49,49,0,3,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX NO.100 537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",0940-9602,,,ANN ANAT,Ann.

Despite widespread use of potent antibiotics, infections of artificial implants and catheters are of increasing concern. We tested whether local treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), long known as an inexpensive wound disinfectant, could prevent or reduce bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials. Methods. Two-centimeter-long pieces of polyurethane and silicone tubing were contaminated with a standardized solution of Staphylococcus epidermidis (10(5)/mL) and then rinsed and wiped with saline (0.9%) solution. Bacterial growth was assessed after incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Bacterial colonies were compared for the following treatments: wiping only with saline; wiping with 1.5%, 2%, or 3% H2O2; pretreating biomaterials with 3% H2O2 and subsequent contamination for 2 and 4 hours without treatment after contamination; and contamination of tubings I month after pretreatment with 30% H2O2. The effect of 3% H2O2 was also assessed on contamination with Escherichia coli. Results. Bacterial growth was reduced by more than 99% when the contaminated tubes were treated with 3% H2O2 compared with saline control (p < 0.001). Lower concentrations of H2O2 were less effective. The length of the contamination period had no influence on the effectiveness of H2O2 when used on polyurethane but did with silicone tubings. Pretreatment with H2O2 1 month before contamination still reduced bacterial growth rate by 90% on polyurethane and by 75% on silicone tubings. Comparable effects on bacterial growth rate were observed for staphylococci (-90%, p < 0.001) and escherichiae (-90%, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Local treatment with 3% H2O2 significantly reduced bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials even for I month after treatment. This finding might influence clinical strategies of prevention of foreign body infection.

Identically sized pins, prepared from poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTB carbonate), poly(DTH carbonate), and poly(DTO carbonate) were implanted transcortically in the proximal tibia and the distal femur of skeletally mature New Zealand White Rabbits. The tissue response at the bone-implant interface was characterized in terms of the absence of a fibrous capsule (direct bone apposition, indicative of a bone bonding response) or the presence of a fibrous capsule (referred to as the encapsulation response). The relative frequency of direct bone apposition versus encapsulation was recorded for each polymer throughout the entire period of the study. While all four polymers were tissue compatible, there was a correlation between the chemical structure of the pendent chain and the type of bone response observed, with poly(DTE carbonate) having the highest tendency to elicit direct bone apposition. Based on in vivo degradation data and the ability of moder polymers with carboxylate groups at their surface to chelate calcium ions, it is proposed that the ability of poly(DTE carbonate) to bond to bone is caused by the facile hydrolysis of the pendent ethyl eater groups which creates calcium ion chelation sites on the polymer surface. The incorporation of calcium chelation sites into the chemical structure of an implant material appears to be a key requirement if direct bone apposition/bone bonding is desired. This study demonstrates that very subtle changes in the chemical composition of an implant material can have significant effects on the long-term tissue response in a clinically relevant model.

In this paper, several in vitro and in vivo techniques from previously published results and current investigations are highlighted and presented to demonstrate means of delineating a part of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between biomaterials and macrophages. Complement component C3 was found critical in mediating the initial adhesion of human macrophages on medical-grade polyetherurethaneureas. From radioimmunoassay studies, the presence of a diphenolic antioxidant additive in polyetherurethaneureas increased the propensity for complement upregulation but did not affect adherent macrophage density. The subcutaneous cage-implant system was utilized to confirm the role of interleukin-4 in the fusion of adherent macrophages to form foreign body giant cells on polyurethanes in vivo. To probe the function-structural relationship of macrophage-active proteins, fibronectin was employed as a model in the formulation of synthetic oligopeptide mimetics. Peptides were grafted onto previously developed, non-cell adhesive polyethyleneglycol-based networks. The results indicate that grafted tripeptide RGD sequence supported higher adherent macrophage density than surfaces grafted with other peptides such as PHSRN and PRRAPV sequences. However, the formation of foreign body giant cells on peptide-grafted networks was highly dependent on the relative orientation between PHSRN and RGD sequences located in a single peptide.

The mechanisms by which a physiologic matrix interface on such polymers may regulate and promote cell migration under 'activated conditions' were the focus of this study. We have quantified the migration behavior of epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated epidermal keratinocytes on 50: 50 poly-D,L(lactide-glycolide) (PLGA) substrates, following exogenous and cell-derived substrate conditioning based on the model matrix proteins, collagen and fibronectin. We report that 'non-conditioned' PLGA substrates elicited poor levels of keratinocyte migration. However, keratinocyte migration was significantly enhanced upon the adsorption of type I collagen, and was only weakly enhanced with fibronectin adsorption. Molecular analysis of the mechanism of enhanced migration on collagen-PLGA substrates showed that keratinocyte migration was sensitive to cell-derived fibronectin conditioning, but not to cell-secreted collagen conditioning. Fibronectin control of cell migration on collagen-PLGA was found to be both stoichiometric and biologically specific, mediated via adhesion involving keratinocyte alpha v integrin receptors. Based on our results, we propose a unique paradigm for induction of cell migration on a non-physiologic synthetic polymer using concerted interactions between primary, polymer-instructed matrix remodeling and secondary, cell-derived matrix remodeling.

To provide a more complete characterization of these interactions, analysis of lymphocyte migration on adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins must accompany the commonly performed adhesion studies. We report here a comparison of the migratory and adhesion behavior of Jurkat cells (a T lymphoblastoid cell line) on tissue culture treated and untreated polystyrene surfaces coated with Various concentrations of fibronectin. The average speed of cell locomotion showed a biphasic response to substrate adhesiveness for cells migrating on untreated polystyrene and a monotonic decrease for cells migrating on tissue culture-treated polystyrene. A modified approach to the persistent random walk model was implemented to determine the time dependence of cell migration parameters. The random motility coefficient showed significant increases with time when cells migrated on tissue culture-treated polystyrene surfaces, while it remained relatively constant for experiments with untreated polystyrene plates. Finally, a cell migration computer model was developed to verify our modified persistent random walk analysis. Simulation results suggest that our experimental data were consistent with temporally increasing random motility coefficients. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There was no correlation between amount of chondrocyte attachment to the substrates and the substrates' water contact angle. Chondrocytes proliferated equally well on all the substrates resulting in equivalent cell numbers on all the substrates at both day 4 and day 7 of the culture. However, these total cell numbers were reached as a result of a 88- and 42-fold expansion on PDO and PLA, respectively, which was significantly higher than the Ii-fold expansion found on TCPS (p < 0.05). The greater fold expansion of the cells on PDO and L-PLA films may be attributed to the availability of space for cells to grow, since their numbers at the start of culture were fewer following the 8 h attachment period. This suggests that regardless of initial seeding density on these degradable polymer substrates (i.e., if some minimum number of cells are able to attach), they will eventually populate the surfaces of all these polymers given sufficient space and time.

The present study evaluated the adherence of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) to an acellular resorbable scaffold material derived from the small intestinal submucosa (SIS). HMECs were exposed to hydrated and dehydrated forms of SIS and to plastic surfaces coated with one of four different known components of the SIS extracellular matrix: collagen Type I, collagen Type IV, fibronectin, and laminin. Results showed that adherence of HMECs to hydrated SIS was greater than to any of the other tested surfaces (P < 0.05). Exposure of HMECs to either soluble collagen Type IV or soluble fibronectin prior to exposure of these cells to hydrated SIS showed only partial inhibition of HMEC attachment. We conclude that HMECs find hydrated SIS to be a suitable substrate for adherence and that dehydration of SIS adversely affects the ability of HMECs to adhere in vitro. The cause of HMEC adherence to SIS appears to be a combination of both its composition and architecture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition to acceleration of normal wound healing phenomena, endosseous implants should result in formation of a characteristic interfacial layer and bone matrix with adequate biomechanical properties. To achieve these goals, however, a better understanding of events at the interface and of the effects biomaterials have on bone and bone cells is needed. Such knowledge is essential for developing strategies to optimally control osseointegration. This paper reviews current knowledge of the bone-biomaterial interface and methods being investigated for controlling it. Morphological studies have revealed the heterogeneity of the bone-implant interface. One feature often reported, regardless of implant material, is an afibrillar interfacial zone, comparable to cement lines and laminae limitantes at natural bone interfaces. These electron-dense interfacial layers are rich in noncollagenous proteins, such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Several approaches, involving alteration of surface physicochemical, morphological, and/or biochemical properties, are being investigated in an effort to obtain a desirable bone-implant interface. Of particular interest are biochemical methods of surface modification, which immobilize molecules on biomaterials for the purpose of inducing specific cell and tissue responses or, in other words, to control the tissue-implant interface with biomolecules delivered directly to the interface. Although still in its infancy, early studies indicate the value of this methodology for controlling cell and matrix events at the bone-implant interface. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many cells on adhesive molecules will spread and form an organized actin cytoskeleton and complex transmembrane signaling regions called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions appear to function as both signaling and stabilizing components of normal adherent cell activity. To better understand adhesion formations between cells and their underlying substrata, we have designed, developed, and utilized a novel 'cytodetachment' methodology to quantify the force required to displace attached cells. We allowed bovine articular chondrocytes to attach and spread on a substratum of either fibronectin, bovine serum albumin, or standard microscope glass. The cytodetacher was then employed to displace the cells from the substratum. Our results demonstrate that a significantly greater force is required to detach cells from fibronectin versus the two other substrata, suggesting that a cell's actin cytoskeleton and perhaps focal adhesions contribute significantly to its mechanical adhesiveness. The cytodetacher allows us to directly measure the force required for cell detachment from a substratum and to indirectly determine the ability of different substrata to support cell adhesion.

Activation of the intracellular small molecular weight GTPase, RhoA, has recently been shown to play an essential role in controlling initiation of key integrin-mediated events in surface adhesion and proliferation. RhoA is interconvertible between an active, membrane-bound form and an inactive, cytosolic RhoGDI-bound form in response to integrin stimulation. This study reports the use of self-assembled functionalized organic alkylthiol monolayers (SAMs) as well-defined cell culture substrates to investigate the relationships between surface chemistry, RhoA activation and subsequent cell morphological and molecular level signal transduction responses in cells attaching to derivatized SAMs. Well-controlled alkylthiol surface chemistries were used to monitor and modulate the activation state of RhoA in attaching cells. Activation states were determined indirectly by fractionating cell lysates into membrane and cytosolic fractions by ultracentrifugation. Western blots were then performed, showing RhoA localization to be surface chemistry-dependent. RhoGDI levels and its intracellular localization were also shown to be surface-chemistry dependent. Cells cultured on -CH3, terminated SAMs, which normally exhibit a low-growth phenotype, were transfected with a constitutively active mutant form of RhoA. Subsequent cell morphological changes were observed on SAM surfaces by fluorescence microscopy. Results support surface chemistry influences on the activation state of RhoA mediated by adsorbed proteins and distinct changes in adherent cell morphology resulting from modulation of this activation state.

Upon gradual heating the enzyme in solution precipitates at 64 degrees C, whereas the encapsulated enzyme does not; it unfolds, with the nominal melting temperature of 51 +/- 3 degrees C. Even at 74.0 degrees C, the encapsulated enzyme is only similar to 77% unfolded, but it does not refold upon cooling. Upon treatment with guanidinium chloride, the degree of enzyme unfolding is 100% in solution but only similar to 83% within the silica matrix. Again, the enzyme does not refold upon removal of the denaturing agent from the glass. The glass matrix constrains the motions of the encapsulated protein molecules and prevents both their full unfolding and refolding. The former may be taken for ""stabilization"", the later for ""destabilization"" of the native conformation. Evidently, the effect of the glass on the encapsulated protein cannot be described in these general terms. The encapsulated enzyme obeys the Michaelis-Menten kinetic law as it catalyzes hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. The apparent Michaelis constant (K'(M)) is practically the same in the glass and in solution, but the apparent turnover number (k'(cat)) and specific activity for the encapsulated enzyme are only 1-2% of these values for the enzyme in solution. Because the substrate diffuses slowly into silica pores, most of the catalysis is due to the enzyme embedded near the surfaces of the glass monolith. Effect of encapsulation on structure and activity of proteins should be studied in quantitative detail before protein-doped glasses can be used as reliable biosensors, heterogeneous catalysts, and composite biomaterials.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50010 USA","Kostic, NM (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",,"Badjic, Jovica/H-9134-2013",,,,,42,81,81,0,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Ten specimens of each type (open and closed) of the three brands of elastic chains were included in the study (total of 60). All specimens were subjected to (a) optical transmission microscopy utilizing phase contrast and polarized light modes, (b) micro MIR FT-IR spectroscopy, and (c) scanning electron microscopy and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. Stretched elastomers demonstrated a honeycomb pattern of filament detachment corresponding to strained areas. The chains possessing a well-differentiated inter-modular link presented higher strain concentration gradients located in the link. Phase contrast imaging revealed that the stress adsorption mechanism of these materials involved macromolecular chain orientation and elongation co-axially to the applied load. The specimens retrieved after 24 hours had acquired a proteinaceous film rich in alcohol groups with minimal evidence of phosphate mineralization, while the 3-week retrieved specimens presented precipitation of Ca- and P-forming calcium phosphates. The high protein content of the biofilm organized on the surface of these materials, as well as the calcification pattern found, were similar to a non-specific mechanism of film adsorption of biomaterials exposed to body fluids. The results have clinical implications for aspects of retraction control through sliding mechanics with the use of elastomeric ligatures, and the potential detrimental effects on dental and periodontal tissues such as decalcification and gingival inflammation, respectively. In addition, the experimental protocols adopted for the in vitro study of the force decay of elastomerics should be modified to include parameters pertinent to adsorption phenomena and calcification processes documented to occur in vivo.","Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester M15 6FH, Lancs, England; Res Ctr Biomat, Athens, Greece","Watts, DC (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Biomat Sci Unit, Manchester M15 6FH, Lancs, England.",,"Eliades, Theodore/E-4959-2017","Eliades, Theodore/0000-0003-2313-4979; Watts, David/0000-0002-9105-2775",,,,22,51,56,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0141-5387,1460-2210,,EUR J ORTHODONT,Eur.

In practice, engineering strains are often used to calculate Poisson's ratio in place of the mathematically correct true strains with only very small differences resulting in the case of many engineering materials. The engineering strain definition is often used even in the inelastic region, for example, in metals during plastic yielding. However, for highly nonlinear elastic materials, such as many biomaterials, smart materials and microstructured materials, this convenient extension may be misleading, and it becomes advantageous to define a strain-varying Poisson's function. This is analogous to the use of a tangent modulus for stiffness. An important recent application of such a Poisson's function is that of auxetic materials that demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio and are often highly strain dependent. In this paper, the importance of the use of a Poisson's function in appropriate circumstances is demonstrated. Interpretation methods for coping with error-sensitive data or small strains are also described.","Univ Exeter, Dept Engn, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England","Smith, CW (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Dept Engn, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.",,"Smith, Christopher/A-3474-2009",,,,,23,50,50,3,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0014-4851,,,EXP MECH,Exp.

The fibroins produced in the spider's major ampullate (MA) gland, which forms the dragline and web frame, contain multiple repeats of motifs that include an 8-10 residue long poly-alanine block and a 24-35 residue long glycine-rich block. When fibroins are spun into fibres, the poly-alanine blocks form beta-sheet crystals that crosslink the fibroins into a polymer network with great stiffness, strength and toughness. As illustrated by a comparison of MA silks from Araneus diadematus and Nephila clavipes, variation in fibroin sequence and properties between spider species provides the opportunity to investigate the design of these remarkable biomaterials.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Gosline, JM (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,,,,,,30,657,695,5,291,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4DL",0022-0949,,,J EXP BIOL,J.

However, the use of these additives has some negative effects such as loss of mechanical properties, risk of release and bone resorption. The use of the monomer 2,5-diiodo-8-quinolyl methacrylate (IHQM), which shows adequate polymerization and radio-opacity properties, is proposed as a new X-ray opaque, methacrylate iodine-containing agent. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of this new radio-opaque agent on the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cements. The addition of the iodine-containing methacrylate provides a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength, fracture toughness and ductility, with respect to the barium sulphate-containing cement. This effect can be attributed to the fact that the use of a radio-opaque monomer eliminates the porosity associated with the barium sulfate particles, which show no adhesion to the matrix. However, some reinforcing effect must also be attributed to the iodine-containing monomer, since the tensile and fracture toughness values reached are even higher than those shown by the radiolucent cement.

In this study, we compared initial adhesion and surface growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 (zeta potential -7 mV) on negatively charged (PMMA/MAA, zeta potential -18 mV) and positively charged (PMMA/TMAEMA-Cl, zeta potential +12 mV) methacrylate copolymers in situ in a parallel plate flow chamber. Initial adhesion was measured using phosphate-buffered saline and subsequent surface growth of the adhering bacteria using nutrient broth as growth medium. Initial adhesion was twice as fast on the positively charged methacrylate than on the negatively charged copolymer. Surface growth, however, was absent on the positively charged copolymer, while on the negatively charged methacrylate the number of bacteria increased exponentially during surface growth with a generation time of 32 min. From the results of this study it can be concluded that positively charged biomaterial surfaces might show reduced risks of biomaterials-centered infections, despite being more adhesive.

Consequently, they may find a range of applications in the biomaterials field. This work evaluated the influence of HA fillers and of blowing agents (used to produce porous architectures) over the viscoelastic properties of SEVA-C polymers, as seen by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), in order to speculate on their performances when withstanding cyclic loading in the body. The composite materials presented a promising performance under dynamic mechanical solicitation conditions. Two relaxations were found being attributed to the starch and EVOH phases. The EVOH relaxation process may be very useful in vivo improving the implants performance under cyclic loading. DMA results also showed that it is possible to produce SEVA-C compact surface/porous core architectures with a mechanical performance similar to that of SEVA-C dense materials. This may allow for the use of these materials as bone replacements or scaffolds that must withstand loads when implanted.

A major problem in the measurement of protein adsorption kinetics in such systems is that the protein has to diffuse through a boundary layer to reach the surface. The thickness of such a boundary layer can be reduced by shearing the fluid phase. In the classical TIRF adsorption chamber only a unidirectional flow of buffer through the chamber is possible. In such a chamber the shear rates and shear stresses vary across the cross section and only low shear rates are obtainable. Therefore based on a rheological system for studying fluid shear stress on cultured cells a TIRF-chamber was constructed which allowed the installment of a rotating cone (max. rate: 1200 rpm) and plate viscometer-type variable shear device. In this case a flow field can be set up in which the shear rates and shear stresses are approximately constant. Cone angles (alpha) between 1.0-2.5 degrees allowed shear rates (gamma) between 0 and 7200 s(-1). The TIRF-rheometer can be employed in two different modes in the form of: (a) a closed system (no fluid flow through the rheometer chamber), (b) an open system with continuous buffer flow through the chamber. The flow conditions were checked by observing the dissolution of a small spot of dried Coomassie blue as a function of the shear rate and time. A significant secondary flow was found with all cone angles and was dependent on the square root of the shear rate. Ink injection studies demonstrate that mixing times in the chamber below two seconds are obtainable. The TIRF Rheometer thus provides a means for studying the shear dependence of the adsorption of blood proteins and the generation of thin to ultra thin boundary layers for the measurement of protein adsorption kinetics relevant to biomaterials.","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol Chem, D-45122 Essen, Germany; Univ Munster, Inst Physiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Jennissen, HP (reprint author), Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Inst Physiol Chem, Hufelandstr 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,44,9,9,0,1,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Treatment options for full thickness cartilage defects are discussed in this paper. Poor biomechanical characteristics of the reparative fibrocartilage promoted by ""traditional resurfacing techniques"" provide only moderate clinical outcome in the treatment of such lesions. During the last decade several new efforts have been expressed to provide a hyaline or hyaline-like gliding surface for a full thickness defected area on the weight bearing surface. Among several surgical procedures, autologous osteochondral transplantation methods, including osteochondral mosaicplasty, chondrocyte transplantation, periosteal and perichondrial resurfacement and allograft transplantation are the favoured ""new methods"". Experimental background, operative techniques and clinical results of these new procedures are detailed in this overview. According to the early and medium term experiences of these methods it seems that a hyaline or hyaline-like resurfacement of the defected area can provide a more durable gliding surface and a better clinical outcome than the so called ""traditional resurfacing techniques"". Autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty - as an easy, one-step procedure, providing a relatively quick rehabilitation - can be an alternative in the treatment of small and medium sized lesions. Excellent clinical outcome, low costs of the treatment and short rehabilitation time represent the main advantages of this method. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be a promising option in the treatment of larger full thickness defects but requires relatively expensive two-step procedure and longer rehabilitation period. Both of the above mentioned techniques have femoral, tibial, patellofemoral and talar applications as well. According to the present recommendations transplantation of osteochondral allografts can be indicated at massive osteochondral lesions. There are less experiences with the clinical use of periosteal and perichondrial resurfacing techniques and biomaterials. Beside the promising early and medium term results of these methods the authors express that a successful treatment of the full-thickness cartilage damages of the weight bearing surfaces depends not only the way of the cartilage repair but on the treatment of the underlying cause as well. According to this statement for an effective treatment of full thickness defects on the weight bearing surfaces requires careful patient selection, complex operative plan and well organized treatment course.","Hop Uzsoki, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary","Hangody, L (reprint author), Hop Uzsoki, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Mexikoi Str 62, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary.",hangody@mail.matavnet.hu,,,,,,57,17,18,0,5,MASSON EDITEUR,MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9,"21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE",0035-1040,,,REV CHIR ORTHOP,Rev.

To investigate whether the mammary gland of transgenic animals fulfills these requirements, transgenic mice were generated containing the alpha S1-casein mammary gland-specific promoter operatively linked to 37 Kb of the human alpha 1(I) procollagen structural gene and 3' flanking region. The frequency of transgenic lines established was 12%. High levels of soluble triple helical homotrimeric [(alpha 1)(3)] type I procollagen were detected (up to 8 mg/ml) exclusively in the milk of six out of 9 lines of lactating transgenic mice. The transgene-derived human procollagen chains underwent efficient assembly into a triple helical structure. Although proline or lysine hydroxylation has never been described for any milk protein, procollagen was detected with these post-translational modifications. The procollagen was stable in mil; minimal degradation was observed. These results show that the mammary gland is capable of expressing a large procollagen gene construct, efficiently assembling the individual polypeptide chains into a stable triple helix, and secreting the intact molecule into the milk.","Cohes Technol, Palo Alto, CA 94303 USA; Pharming BV, NL-2333 CA Leiden, Netherlands","Toman, PD (reprint author), Cohes Technol, 2500 Faber Pl, Palo Alto, CA 94303 USA.",,,,,,,95,39,48,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0962-8819,,,TRANSGENIC RES,Transgenic Res.,DEC,1999.0,8,6,,,,,415,427,,10.1023/A:1008959924856,,,,13,Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,288TG,WOS:000085580100002,10767986.0,,,,2019-02-25

It is experimentally proved that a liquid-liquid phase separation is responsible for this peculiar behaviour. Based on transmission electron microscopy observations of glasses and glass-ceramics, a novel growth mechanism is proposed for cabbage-shaped mica crystal aggregates in machinable mica glass-ceramics. In this model, crystallization takes place along isocompositional lines at or not far from the surface of the liquid-liquid phase separation droplets. Due to high growth rates, diffusion has only little impact on the crystal growth. Finally, experimental reasons for earlier misinterpretations are discussed. (C) 1999 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

Ingrowth and organization of fibrovascular tissue inside polymer scaffolds lead to the occlusion of the regenerated blood vessel. In order to provide regulatory mechanisms to control the development of an inner capsule, endothelialization of these materials is necessary. To achieve this, we employed a novel ammonia plasma technique to surface modified PLLA substrates. Human endothelial cell (HUVEC) and rabbit microvascular endothelial cell (RbMVEC) growth was studied on modified PLLA and control PLLA. Our studies show that modified PLLA and fibronectin (Fn)-coated modified PLLA exhibited statistically significant improvement in HUVEC and RbMVEC growth (P < 0.001) when compared to PLLA and Fn-coated PLLA. Therefore, ammonia plasma treatment gives us the unique capability of modifying prosthetic biomaterials of various constructs with the eventual transplantation of mammalian cells to be used in tissue engineering or as biological implants.

Water-soluble organics have limitations as reagents for metal-ion separations from aqueous solutions. However, if the ligand molecule(s) are grafted on to an insoluble matrix the resulting ligand(s)-containing product becomes useful for separations applications related to metal recovery or remediation. It was discovered that biomolecules containing a primary amino group, secondary amino group, or hydroxyl group could be grafted into a polyurethane polymeric network via in situ polymerization reactions. With carboxyl groups, grafted material showed goon selectivity among a group of divalent metal cations, and a uranium-binding capacity of more than 10 mg/g of polymer. The material can be regenerated by sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate solution and reused. Data from a stirred-tank reactor showed fast uranium-binding kinetics, and breakthrough-elution studies with a packed-column reactor indicated promising process behavior.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Reeves, M (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",,,"Hu, Michael/0000-0001-8461-9684",,,,62,9,9,1,12,AMER INST CHEMICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0001-1541,,,AICHE J,AICHE J.,NOV,1999.0,45,11,,,,,2333,2345,,10.1002/aic.690451109,,,,13,"Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,254PD,WOS:000083620600008,,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of incorporation of this monomer to the self-curing resins, on the curing parameters, swelling behaviour and mechanical properties was studied. The incorporation of the radiopaque compound 2,5-diiodo-8-hydroxyquinoline to the solid phase was also carried out for comparative experiments. A decrease in the peak temperature and an increase in the setting time was observed with the addition of the radiopaque monomer, however, the curing parameters did not appreciably change with the addition of the radiopaque compound to the solid phase. Swelling of the modified cements was in the same range as that of the radiolucent cement; however, the diffusion coefficients calculated according to the Fick's law were higher for the iodine-containing materials. The addition of 5 wt% of the iodine-containing methacrylate provided a significant increase in the tensile properties with respect to either control radiolucent formulations or BaSO4-containing formulations. Biocompatibility of the modified cements was studied by implantation of rods of the cements into rats and histological analysis of the surrounding tissue. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Protein adsorption on latex particles applied as model for intravenous drug carriers was analysed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The particles were incubated in citrated plasma, serum and heat-inactivated serum, respectively. Incubation in the various media resulted in clear differences in the protein adsorption patterns. Two characteristic protein spots were determined to be enriched on the 2-DE gels only after incubation of the particles in serum. Employing N-terminal microsequencing these protein spots were identified to be fragments of the complement protein C3. Enrichment of these particular spots was most likely a result of complement activation by the particles. Mechanism of C3 binding to the particle surface and subsequent inactivation by cleavage are discussed in order to explain the results. It could be demonstrated that 2-DE analysis provides the possibility to distinguish between adsorption and covalent attachment of C3 to particulate surfaces. The findings indicate that complement activation was caused by covalent binding of the C3 component C3b to the particles' surface. The influence of the incubation medium on the in vitro protein adsorption of particulate drug carriers has to be considered when a correlation between the protein adsorption pattern and the in vivo behaviour of the particles is approached.

In our work, three series of polyurethane/liquid crystal composite membranes based on three different kinds of liquid crystal compounds [N-(-4-methyoxybenzylidene)-4'-heptylaniline, 4-pentyl-4'-nitrile-biphenyl and cholesteryl oleyl carbonate] were prepared by casting on glass plates from a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of polymer and liquid crystal at room temperature. In our opinion, the formation of liquid crystal phase on the composite membrane surface is the basic requirement for getting better biomaterial. The result of this work is in accordance with our opinion. The effect of liquid crystal content on the formation of liquid crystal phase was identified by the observation of optical polarization microscopy (OPM). The results showed that the content of liquid crystal in composite membrane must be more than 30% (wt) in order to form liquid crystal phase on the composite membrane surface. The blood-compatibility of the composite membranes was assessed from SEM observation of the platelet's adhesion to membrane's surface, blood clotting time and haemolysis ratio. The observation of platelet's adhesion showed that the platelets gathered together on the pure polyurethane films, but the amount of platelets which were adherent on the surface covered by the liquid crystal phase was fewer than that of pure polyurethane film when platelet-rich plasma was allowed to be in contact with the membranes for Ih at room temperature. The determination of blood clotting time and haemolysis ratio showed that these polyurethane/liquid crystal composite membranes, in which the content of liquid crystal was more than 30% (wt), appear to be beneficial in improving the blood compatibility and reducing the thrombogenicity.

Forty four cavities were prepared in the upper lumbar vertebrae of 11 sheep using a biopsy trocar via a posterior-lateral extracanal percutaneous route and the location was monitored by radiology with a brilliance amplifier. The cavities were 3 mm in diameter. The histological study was performed on 15 cavities which were left empty to give reference data for the model. Histological and histomorphometry results showed that 67% of the surface area of the empty cavities was still empty 3 months after their preparation. Thus, the natural regenerative capacity of vertebral trabecular bone is limited. We performed preliminary percutaneous injections of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and nacre powder to assess whether this bone-defect model would be suitable for further studies on bone repair. Cavities were successfully filled with nacre powder (21 cavities) or PMMA (8 cavities) while monitoring the process by interventional radiology.

The light-induced binding and dissociation of the biomaterials to and from the electrodes, respectively, are electronically transduced. Two systems,including the photostimulated binding and dissociation of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and of anti-DNP antibody to and from functionalized surfaces, are discussed. The application of the systems as optobioelectronic devices and reversible immunosensors is addressed. A mixed monolayer consisting of pyridine and nitrospiropyran (1a) photoisomerizable units assembled on a Au-electrode acts as a command interface for the light-controlled association and dissociation of Cyt c to and from the monolayer. Cyt c binds to the pyridine/1a-monolayer electrode, resulting in electrical contact between the redox protein and the electrode. Photoisomerization of the mixed monolayer to the pyridine/protonated merocyanine state (Ib) results in the electrostatic repulsion of Cyt c and its dissociation from the electrode support. This blocks the electrical contact between Cyt c and the electrode. By the cyclic photoisomerization of the mixed monolayer between the la and Ib states, reversible ""ON""-""OFF"" amperometric transduction of the affinity interactions between the redox protein and the interface is accomplished. Coupling of the photostimulated electrical contact between Cyt c and the electrode surface to the Cyt c-mediated bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of O-2 by cytochrome oxidase provides a means to amplify the transduced electronic signal. A photoisomerizable thiolated dinitrospiropyran (2a) monolayer, assembled on solid supports, acts as a light-active antigen interface that enables the photocontrolled binding and dissociation of anti-dinitrophenyl antibody (DNP-Ab) to and from the interface. The dinitrospiropyran (2a) layer acts as an antigen for the DNP-Ab, whereas the protonated dinitromerocyanine (2b) lacks antigen features for the DNP-Ab. By reversible photoisomerization of the monolayer between the 2a and 2b states, cyclic binding and dissociation of DNP-Ab to and from the monolayer interface is accomplished. The association and dissociation of the DNP-Ab to and from the 2a- and 2b-monolayer states are electronically transduced, using amperometric, Faradaic impedance and microgravimetric, quartz crystal microbalance analyses. The photostimulated binding of an antibody to a photoisomerizable antigen monolayer provides a novel method to design reversible immunosensor devices.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Willner, I (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",,,,,,,52,17,17,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",8756-7938,,,BIOTECHNOL PROGR,Biotechnol.

Functionally, craniosynostosis may be defined as the premature conversion of the dynamic region of growth and resorption between two adjacent bones of the cranium into a static region of bony union. Molecular analysis has blurred the traditional categories of nonsyndromic and syndromic synostosis to some extent, but, in general, the distinctions between the two groups still hold true. The complexity of the congenital anomalies may be limited with the former, whereas the latter usually requires reoperations and correction of the facial skeleton, This article briefly outlines the characteristic deformities produced from nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, Various approaches to surgical correction of the deformities are described.

Ten UCLA abutments were cast in each of 4 alloys: Type ill gold, ceramometal gold, commercially pure grade I titanium, and titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V); 10 ceramic abutments and 30 sterile Branemark System implants were also used. Five abutments of each material and 5 implants were incubated individually in rat bone marrow culture, as were 5 of each abutment attached to an implant; bone marrow cultures not containing test samples were used as controls. Following 17 days of culture, the solution potentials of individual abutments (except ceramic), the implant, and the implant-abutment couples were measured in the test medium. One dish of each group of 5 was then stained for bone nodule mineralization; the remainder were quantified by area for alkaline phosphatase staining. Statistical analysis of measured in vitro potentials showed that the uncoupled samples formed 2 groups, and coupled samples formed 3 groups. Analysis of variance for alkaline phosphatase-positive area values showed no significant differences between coupled or uncoupled groups and the control. Normal cell differentiation and morphology, as well as a lack of zones of inhibition, were observed. Bone nodule mineralization was evident in all groups. It was concluded that the presence of these commonly used implant abutment biomaterials coupled to titanium endosseous dental implants had no adverse effects on the in vitro capacity of preosteoblasts in marrow to differentiate and to form mineralized bone nodules, despite measured differences in solution potentials.","Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Div Prosthodont, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Natl Def Med Ctr, Canadian Forces Dent Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Halifax, NS, Canada; Dalhousie Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Appl Oral Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; Univ Maryland, Sch Dent, Adv Educ Program Prosthodont, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Taylor, JC (reprint author), 532 Montreal Rd,Suite 214, Ottawa, ON K1K 4R4, Canada.",,,,,,,57,6,6,0,5,QUINTESSENCE PUBL CO INC,CAROL STREAM,"551 NORTH KIMBERLY DR, CAROL STREAM, IL 60188-1881 USA",0882-2786,,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Anorganic bovine bone (Bio-Oss) has been reported to be osteoconductive, and no inflammatory responses have been observed with the use of this biomaterial. One of the main questions pertaining to Bio-Oss concerns its biodegradation and substitution by host bone. Some investigators have observed rapid replacement by host bone, while other researchers observed slow resorptive activity or no resorption at all. The aim of the present study was to conduct a long-term histologic analysis of retrieved specimens in humans where Bio-Oss was used in sinus augmentation procedures. Specimens were retrieved from 20 patients after varying peri ods from 6 months to 4 years and were processed to obtain thin ground sections. Bio-Oss particles were surrounded for the most part by mature, compact bone. In some Haversian canals it was possible to observe small capillaries, mesenchymal cells, and osteoblasts in conjunction with new bone. No gaps were present at the interface between the Bio-Oss particles and newly formed bone, in specimens retrieved after 18 months and 4 years, it was also possible to observe the presence of osteoclasts in the process of resorbing the Bio-Oss particles and neighboring newly formed bone. Bio-Oss appears to be highly biocompatible and osteoconductive, is slowly resorbed in humans, and can be used with success as a bone substitute in maxillary sinus augmentation procedures.","Univ G dAnnunzio, Sch Dent, Chieti, Italy; Univ Padua, Sch Dent, Padua, Italy; UCL Eastman Dent Inst Oral Hlth Care Sci, London, England","Piattelli, A (reprint author), Via F Sciucchi 63, I-66100 Chieti, Italy.",apiattelli@unich.it,"Orsini, Giovanna/B-5470-2016; Scarano, Antonio/F-6961-2017","Orsini, Giovanna/0000-0002-2641-0695; Scarano, Antonio/0000-0003-1374-6146; favero, gian antonio/0000-0002-9126-2393",,,,34,301,314,0,30,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

Silanes on different PEG molecules formed covalent bonds by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation. Addition of monosilylated PEG resulted in the incorporation of dangling PEG chains, which increased the swelling ratio of the hydrogels slightly. PEG hydrogels in microspheres were prepared by emulsifying aqueous silylated PEG solution in oil followed by curing. Crosslinked PF127 hydrogels displayed inverse thermosensitivity. The previously swollen PF127 hydrogels shrank immediately at high temperatures (e.g., 60 degrees C), but the welling of shrunken hydrogels at low temperature (e.g., 5 degrees C) took much longer. The release of fluorescein from the PF127 hydrogels was dependent on the temperature of the environment. The release of fluorescein from the PF127 hydrogels was faster at 45 degrees C than at 5 degrees C. This was most likely due to shrinking of the hydrogels leading to squeezing of the incorporated fluorescein. The ability of hydrogel formation by simple sol-gel transition of silylated PEG can be used to prepare new drug delivery systems and biomaterials.","Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Park, K (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,18,2,2,1,10,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0883-9115,,,J BIOACT COMPAT POL,J.

Al though poly(NVP) is capable of absorbing relatively large amounts of water, it is not prone to hydrolysis. Yet intraocular degradation of several crosslinked poly(NVP) hydrogels has been reported recently, but some ambiguity remains about the exact mechanism of degradation of these materials. To date there is no biomaterial that combines the excellent intraocular biocompatibility on the one hand and controlled kinetics of degradation on the other hand. We attempted to design and prepare such materials through the chemical synthesis of a novel dimethacrylate crosslinker molecule. The essential feature of this molecule is that its core contains two carbonate groups, which are evidently susceptible to hydrolytic scission. We studied a series of 3-dimensional networks of poly(NVP), which were crosslinked by this molecule. This approach offers several advantages: the hydrolysis of the carbonate groups in the crosslinks leads to liberation of poly(NVP) and/or oligo(NVP) chains that can probably be cleared from the eye via phagocytosis; hydrolysis generates two alcohols and CO2 (i.e., there is no catalytic burst effect); when these materials are implanted in dry form, swelling and degradation will progress from the exterior of the material toward its interior. Therefore, these materials can be designed such that surface degradation rather than bulk degradation occurs; the hydrolysis rate can be controlled via the crosslink density or through synthesis of other crosslink molecules with either more (>2) or less (1) carbonate groups or alternatively with one or more other labile groups. We report on the chemical synthesis of the crosslinker molecule, as well, as the preparation and degradation of a series of poly(NVP)-based hydrogels in vitro and in vivo (rabbit eyes). We found that these materials indeed displayed excellent biocompatibility in the rabbit eye. Further, the experiments confirmed that degradation occurs without the burst effect. The results are in line with the idea that the rate of intraocular swelling and degradation depends on the crosslink density, but this is only a preliminary conclusion that must be strengthened by much more experimental work. Nonetheless, we foresee several applications of these or related materials in ophthalmology, for example, as biodegradable matrix materials for controlled drug delivery of ganciclovir in the vitreous body.

This study was performed to evaluate the inflammatory cell recruitment, distribution, and ex vivo metabolic activation of surfaces with different plasma protein adsorption and complement activation properties in vitro. The implants were (1) pure gold (reference), (2) albumin-precoated (3) IgG-precoated gold, and (4) 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol [mercaptoglycerol (MG)] and (5) glutathione (GSH) immobilized to gold. The implant disks were inserted subcutaneously in rats for 24 h, and the number of inflammatory cells that were recruited to the implant adjacent to the surrounding fluid phase (exudate) and the surfaces were quantified by DNA measurements. The oxidative burst was analyzed ex vivo using spontaneous and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated, luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). The in vitro surface-induced anti-rat C3 binding was evaluated by ellipsometry and antibody techniques after plasma incubations for 1 and 30 min. The ellipsometric results showed that immobilized mercaptoglycerol and IgG-coated, but not the immobilized glutathione or the reference Au, bound anti-C3. The in vivo results revealed that the largest amount of cells was associated with the IgG-coated surfaces, followed by immobilized GSH and MG, albumin-coated, and gold surfaces, respectively. No spontaneous es vivo luminol-enhanced CL was recorded from the cells irrespective of surface functionality or localization. A downregulation of surface-associated and exudate leukocyte CL was observed ex vivo, irrespective of surface functionality. The results do not indicate a clear relationship between the degree of complement activation in vitro and leukocyte recruitment and adhesion in vivo for differently functionalized surfaces.

Crosslinking at pH 9.0 (BD90) or with successive epoxy and carbodiimide steps (BD45EN) resulted in a large increase in the shrinkage temperature (T-s) in combination with a clear reduction in amines. Crosslinking at pH 4.5 (BD45) increased the T-s of the material but hardly reduced the number of amines. Acylation (BD45HAc) showed the largest reduction in amines in combination with the lowest T-s. An evaluation of the implants showed that BD45, BD90, and BD45EN were biocompatible. A high influx of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages was observed for BD45HAc, but this subsided at day 5. At week 6 the BD45 had completely degraded and BD45HAc was remarkably reduced in size, while BD45EN showed a clear size reduction of the outer DSC bundles; BD90 showed none of these features. This agreed with the observed degree of macrophage accumulation and giant cell formation. None of the materials calcified. For the purpose of soft tissue replacement, BD90 was defined as the material of choice because it combined biocompatibility, low cellular ingrowth, low biodegradation, and the absence of calcification with fibroblast ingrowth and new collagen formation.

Setting: Central Hospital, Vaasa, and institute of Dentistry and Turku Center for Biomaterials, University of Turku, Finland. Methods: Rabbit corneal tissue cultures were set up on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), heparin-surface-modified (HSM) PMMA, silicone, acrylate, and hydrogel IOLs for 1 week. The tissue consisted of intact epithelium and half the thickness of the corneal stroma, which was placed against the IOL. The growth of the epithelium was examined by light microscopy to evaluate the attachment of the corneal explant to the IOL surface. Results: All tissue samples grew well under the culture conditions. When grown on PMMA, HSM PMMA, silicone, and hydrogel, the tissue did not attach to the IOL or the epithelium grew around the explant, suggesting that the attachment of the st,oma to the IOL was poor or nonexistent. Some explants on acrylate IOLs attached directly to the IOL surface with no epithelial ingrowth between the stroma and the IOL. Conclusions: This tissue culture method can be used to examine the behavior of corneal tissue in contact with different IOL materials. The results suggest that the acrylate IOL may have bioactive properties. This, with the lens optic's square edge, may hinder lens epithelial cell proliferation and thus prevent PCO.

In order to improve the mechanical properties and reliability of HAp based composites, the addition of selected polymers is highly recommended, The main objective of this work is to study the microstructural characteristics of HAp/poly-L-lactide (PLLA) composites obtained by cold or hot processing. The composites were prepared from a mixture of a chloroform solution of poly-L-lactide with granulated HAp. After elimination of chloroform by vacuum evaporation, dense compacts were obtained by cold or hot pressing. The pressing pressure ranged from 98.10 to 294.3 MPa for both cold and hot pressing, The hot pressing was performed in the temperature region 293-457 K for a time period of 15-60 min. Depending on the PLLA amount and the pressing procedure it is possible to obtain highly porous or nearly fully dense composites, The scanning electron microscopy examination of fracture as well as of free surfaces revealed that the final porosity and wetting are affected to a great extent by the synthesis conditions and amount of polymer added. An increase in temperature to 457 K for a longer period of time results in fully dense compacts, The formation of a nearly continuous polymer network that leads to the hardening of HAp has also been observed. However, it should be pointed out that some layers of HAp may be free of polymer film since PLLA penetrates more deeply into the porous HAp.","Serbian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Tech Sci, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Fac Technol & Met Belgrade, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Univ Nis, Univ Ctr Electron Microscopy, YU-18000 Nish, Yugoslavia; Univ Nis, Fac Elect Engn, YU-18000 Nish, Yugoslavia","Uskokovic, DP (reprint author), Serbian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Tech Sci, K Mihajlova 35-4, YU-11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia.",,"Ignjatovic, Nenad/C-4489-2008; Uskokovic, Dragan/B-4129-2008","Ignjatovic, Nenad/0000-0002-5749-094X; Uskokovic, Dragan/0000-0002-0421-4968",,,,13,42,42,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-2720,,,J MICROSC-OXFORD,J.

Because endotoxin has many of the same effects as have been reported for wear particles, we hypothesized that adherent endotoxin may be responsible for the biological responses induced by wear particles. We demonstrated the presence of significant levels of adherent endotoxin on commonly used preparations of titanium particles as well as on titanium and titanium-alloy implant surfaces. In contrast, supernatants obtained by centrifugation of particle suspensions contained approximately 1% as much endotoxin as did the particles. Therefore, it is erroneous to assume that particles do not contain endotoxin on the basis of data that it cannot be detected in their supernatants or filtrates. These results emphasize the importance of considering the potential role of adherent endotoxin when examining the in vitro effects of wear particles and the in vivo performance of orthopaedic implants. We also developed a protocol that removed more than 99.94% of the adherent endotoxin from the titanium particles without detectably affecting their size or shape. The removal of adherent endotoxin will allow comparison of the biological responses induced by particles with or without adherent endotoxin.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Greenfield, EM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Orthopaed, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [AR07505, AR43769]",,,54,137,140,1,8,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

For this purpose, (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid (H-AMPB-OH) and (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid (H-APB-OH) were synthesized and used to cyclize a bis-cysteinyl-octapeptide giving monocyclic derivatives in which additional conformational restriction could be introduced by conversion to bicyclic structures with a disulphide bridge. While synthesis with H-AMPB-OH proceeded smoothly on a chlorotrityl-resin with Fmoc/tBu chemistry, the poor nucleophilicity of the arylamino group of H-APB-OH required special chemistry for satisfactory incorporation into the peptide chain. Additional difficulties were encountered in the reductive cleavage of the S-tert-butylthio group from the cysteine residues since concomitant reduction of the azobenzene moiety took place at competing rates. This difficulty was eventually bypassed by using the S-trityl protection. Side-chain cyclization of the APE-peptide proved to be difficult, suggesting that restricted conformational freedom was already present in the monocyclic form, a fact that was fully confirmed by NMR structural analysis. Conversely, the methylene spacer in the AMPB moiety introduced sufficient flexibility for facile and quantitative side-chain cyclization to the bicyclic form. Both of the monocyclic peptides and both of the bicyclic peptides are photoresponsive molecules which undergo cis/trans isomerization reversibly.

Identification of the chemiluminescence agent from the whey fraction indicated the participation of lipoxygenase in the emission.

Emission maxima for H2O2 and cumene-OOH were 670 nm, and emission maxima for MEK-OOH and tert-BuOOH were at 510 nm. The photon intensity from the gallic acid lipoxygenase system corresponded to the linoleic acid hydroperoxide value. A high correlation of photon intensity with hydroperoxide, including linoleic hydroperoxide was useful as a simple and sensitive method for the direct detection of hydroperoxides in biomaterials.

An alternative to synthetic materials would be a biomaterial that could be used in the design of a tissue-engineered graft. We demonstrate that a small-diameter (4 mm) graft constructed from a collagen biomaterial derived from the submucosa of the small intestine and type I bovine collagen has the potential to integrate into the host tissue and provide a scaffold for remodeling into a functional blood vessel. The results obtained using a rabbit arterial bypass model have shown excellent hemostasis and patency. Furthermore, within three months after implantation, the collagen grafts were remodeled into cellularized vessels that exhibited physiological activity in response to vasoactive agents.","Organogenesis Inc, Canton, MA 02021 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; KGB Associates Inc, Charleston, SC 29401 USA","Sullivan, S (reprint author), Organogenesis Inc, Canton, MA 02021 USA.",,,,,,,39,213,230,3,34,NATURE AMERICA INC,NEW YORK,"345 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1707 USA",1087-0156,,,NAT BIOTECHNOL,Nat.

The possibility of inhibiting the initial adhesion of neutrophils to biomaterials has been studied extensively, but the problem remains unsolved. In this study, we investigated the effect of HK adsorption on polyurethane, a widely used component of extracorporeal and intracorporeal devices. HK and HKa were allowed to adsorb on 4 different charged polyurethanes: noncharged (PU), cationic (NR4), anionic (SO3), and zwitterionic (GPC) polyurethanes. The effect of kininogen adsorption on neutrophil adhesion, the surface density of the adsorbed kininogen, and the exposure of HK domains 3 and 5 (D-3 and D-5H) which are responsible for the binding of HK to the neutrophil integrin alpha(m)beta(2) or Mac-1, were examined. On PU, NR4, and SO3, kininogen adsorption reached 80% of monolayer coverage when 100 pmol/mL or higher concentration of protein solutions were used. The NR4 surface adsorbed the most kininogen along with a high exposure of D-3 and D-5H. The availability of D-3 and D5H allowed neutrophils to bind to the surface via the Mac-1 receptor; thus, on the NR4 surface, adsorbed kininogens lost their antiadhesive property, which resulted in a high degree of neutrophil adhesion. Increasing Mac-1 expression by exposure to fMLP increased the neutrophil adhesion on this surface. In contrast, exposure of D-3 and D-5H on SO3 was significantly less, because HK binds to anionic surfaces with similar protein sequences used for cell binding. This low binding site exposure preserved the antiadhesive property of HK. GPC was resistant to neutrophil adhesion even in the absence of adsorbed kininogens because of its phosphorylcholine moiety. Thus, both SO3 coupled with kininogen (or kininogen peptides) and GPC have the potential to markedly reduce neutrophil adhesion to biomaterial devices.

However, before these PPy-coated materials can be investigated for their capacity to generate endothelialized luminal surfaces, they must first be studied for their innocuousness in a living environment. The specific goal of the present study was to investigate the in vivo interactions of PPy-coated and noncoated woven polyester materials implanted subcutaneously in rats for prescheduled periods of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days. The in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times were computed for a small area of muscle tissue adjacent to the implants. A correlation was concurrently attempted with blood monocyte activation studies as well as histological observations of the tissue-material interface. The progressive pattern of the slower transversal relaxation time (T-2s) values revealed a more persistent tissue reaction for the most conductive PPy-coated materials and a shorter acute tissue response as the surface resistivity increased. Similarly, the blood monocyte activation studies indicated that the thickness of the PPy coating, which correlated with the conductivity, was directly related to tissue response. Furthermore, both the MR and biological studies showed that the PPy-coated material with a high surface resistivity displayed the lowest tissue reaction over the entire period of implantation. The results obtained from the blood monocyte activation studies and histological observations correlate well with the noninvasive MR measurements of the body's healing process. The conductive materials with high surface resistivities must be further investigated. Finally, the noninvasive nature of MR relaxometry reveals its outstanding potential for future in vivo investigations of the body's tissue interactions with polymers and nonferromagnetic biomaterials.","Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Quebec Biomat Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Rheumatol & Immunol Res Ctr, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,52,19,20,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

One hydroxyapatite ceramic (S-HA), macroporous implants with rough pore walls containing abundant micropores, was made by Sichuan Union University (Chengdu, China); the other hydroxyapatite ceramic (J-HA), porous implants with smooth macropore walls composed of regularly aligned crystal grains, was provided by Mitsubishi Ceramic Int. (Japan). Different tissue response was detected histologically and microradiographically after the ceramic samples had been implanted in dorsal muscles of dogs for 3 and 6 months. Bone formation was found in S-HA at 3 months, which increased at 6 months. In contrast, no bone formation was detected in J-HA at both 3 and 6 months. These results indicate that with the special architecture, calcium phosphate ceramic can induce bone formation in soft tissue. As both materials were very similar in their chemical and crystallographic structures, but varied in their microstructures, the latter seem to be an important factor affecting the osteoinductive capacity of calcium phosphate ceramics. These data suggest that, by controlling the preparation of calcium phosphate ceramic, bone substitutes with intrinsic osteoinductive property can be developed from calcium phosphates.

However, contraction or detachment of the capsule can lead to complications. Biocompatibility of biomaterials may be improved by the application of proteins regulating the differentiation or activation of(myo)fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, differentiating from fibroblasts can be identified by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SM actin). We investigated the influence of proliferation and quiescence on the differentiation of porcine dermal cells and whether transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in the differentiation of proliferating cells. Porcine cells were used because pigs increasingly function as in vivo models while little is known of the characteristics of their cells. Serum-free cultured, quiescent fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, while proliferating fibroblasts cultured in the presence of serum containing TGF-beta, formed alpha-SM actin-negative cell clusters. After reaching confluency, these clusters started to expressing alpha-SM actin. Moreover, these proliferating cells produced TGF-beta from day 4 onwards while bFGF did not. Differentiation into myofibroblasts was inhibited by bFGF and to an even greater extent by antibodies to TGF-beta. Further, two theories concerning the role of the myofibroblast in tissue contraction in view of two biomaterial application will be discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The reliability of the estimation by fluorescence image analysis was validated by comparison with visual counting and with results obtained by an electronic particle counter. In this way it was possible to demonstrate that the adhesive properties of bone cells are dependent on the type of substrate-enstatite (MgO, SiO2, CaO-P2O5-Al2O3), Thermanox(R) (modified polyethyleneterephthalate), or glass. In contrast, the spread of the cell cytoplasm, labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and measured by image analysis, does not vary significantly according to the substrate. The characterisation by SKIZ tessellation of the spatial cell arrangement shows that the bone cells have a random organisation on Thermanox(R) and glass, whereas they form aggregates on enstatite.

The new approach essentially rests upon photochemical immobilisation of the highly biocompatible polymer poly(N-vinylpyrrolidinone) (poly(NVP)) onto the biomaterial's surface. One of the key steps in the surface modification procedure is the preparation of a copolymer of NVP and the photoreactive building block 4-[4'-azidobenzoyl]-oxo-n-butylmethacrylate (1). This copolymer is first dissolved in a volatile solvent, then sprayed onto the biomaterial's surface, and subsequently immobilised via irradiation with ultraviolet light. The paper describes: (i) preparation of 1, (ii) preparation of the copolymer (NVP + 1), (iii) physico-chemical characterisation of the modified surfaces, and (iv) results of two in vitro haemocompatibility assays (i.e. thrombin generation and adhesion of blood platelets from recalcified human platelet-rich plasma). Furthermore, the surface modification was performed with a microporous polyurethane vascular graft (Chronoflex (R)), which is already in clinical use. The in vitro experiments revealed that significant improvement of the haemocompatibility of polyurethanes can be achieved through this method. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The most frequent causes are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Several studies have been devoted to identify adhesion mechanisms for these bacteria. Slime in particular has been extensively investigated. Recently, in Staphylococcus aureus species, considerable attention has been given to the host protein receptors that have been shown in in vitro assays to serve as substrates for bacterial adhesion. Collagen-rich tissues, as bone and cartilage, that are the preferential sites of staphylococcal infections, are also the tissues that harbour orthopaedic implants. These can be easily coated in vivo by collagen and thus become prone to adhesion of Staphylococci strains which carry the collagen adhesin gene (cna). In this study the frequency of cna was determined within a collection of 35 Staphylococcus aureus strains from orthopaedic prosthesis infections by a PCR method. Also the collagen-binding ability and slime forming capacity was evaluated. 29% of the strains were cna-positive and also able to bind collagen in vitro. 83% of the strains were slime forming. The results indicate that in the examined bacterial population slime-positive strains predominate over the cna-positive strains, with a striking association of the two adhesion mechanisms in cna-positive strains.

Little is known, however, about the contributions of these novel repair strategies to restoration of normal meniscal function.

Catheter thrombogenicity was evaluated in humans during angiographic procedures by their tendency to become occluded. Characterization of catheters was achieved using roughness measurements, FTIR with ATR, DSC and ESCA. The catheters were 5 commercially available catheters, made mainly of polyethylene, Pebaux(R) or polyamide sterilized and ready for clinical use. Thirty-one patients due to have an angiographic procedure and with normal blood and hemodynamic parameters were included in the study. The 50 cm catheter test sample was inserted through an introducer into the femoral artery at the beginning of an angiographic procedure. The outcoming blood flow rate (BFR) was continuously monitored by a special computerized device for 15 min or until the total amount of blood reached 30 ml. The angiographic procedure was then normally resurned. DSC and FTIR showed results consistent with the expected composition of catheters. ESCA results showed very high Si/C ratios and could not be explained in all instances. Occlusion of the catheters occurred in 44 % of the cases and the average time to obtain occlusion was 8.5 min (3-15 min). Values of the decrease rate of BFR in ml/min(2) allowed separate of the catheters into 3 groups of low, medium and high thrombogenicity. However, occlusion occurred at least one time for each type of catheter. Blood volume and BFR curves vs. time allowed the determination of 3 main types of thrombotic behavior: type I shows no significant reduction of BFR; type II shows a progressive decrease in flow rate; type III is much less frequent and shows an abrupt decrease of BFR either quickly followed by a compensatory increase and resuming of a steady flow or by abrupt occlusion. in type N curves the pattern of occlusion follows a classical diffusion model because the Peclet number is greater than I and then the classical Higble solution for diffusion could be used (33). The most thrombogenic material was the smoothest. There was no correlation between surface chemical composition and thrombogenicity. However, catheters that were based on PE appeared less thrombogenic than PA catheters in this study.","Univ Paris 11, Ctr Etud Pharmaceut, Lab Biomat & Polymers, URM 8612, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; Claude Bernard Res Fund, Lab Neuroradiol & Therapeut Angiog, Paris, France; Hop St Francois Assise, Inst Biomat Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Lab Biorheol Hydrodynam & Physiochem, Paris, France","Lautier, A (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, Ctr Etud Pharmaceut, Lab Biomat & Polymers, URM 8612, 5 Rue JB Clement, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France.",,,,,,,44,8,8,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0391-3988,1724-6040,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

As these applications involve surgical insertion of gels, the effect of cross-linking on mechanical properties is relevant. The effect of cross-linking on the gel water uptake is also relevant for the kinetics of drug release. Equally important is the influence of initial amounts of gelatin in the gelling solutions. We investigated the influence of cross-linking (with glutaraldehyde) and of gelatin content upon the equilibrium water content and tensile properties of resulting gels. A range of gels was prepared with gelatin contents of 10 to 40% wt, and cross-linked with 2.5 to 50% wt glutaraldehyde. The increase in gelatin content and degree of cross-linking reduced the water uptake of gels from about 60-65% wt to about 50% wt. The tensile characteristics were differentially affected. While the increase of cross-linking induced a decrease of toughness and elasticity and an increase of stiffness, it did not affect the ultimate strength of gels. On the contrary, the increase of gelatin content induced a definite increase of the ultimate strength but did not significantly affect the other properties.","Univ Western Australia, Dept Biomat & Polymer Res, Lions Eye Inst, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Ctr Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",,,"Lou, Xia/A-7333-2010","Lou, Xia/0000-0002-4052-8200",,,,23,32,34,3,18,TECHNOMIC PUBL CO INC,LANCASTER,"851 NEW HOLLAND AVE, BOX 3535, LANCASTER, PA 17604 USA",0885-3282,,,J BIOMATER APPL,J.

As there is no effective method currently available to prevent such biomaterials from calcifying, a practical solution is to use only materials with a relatively high resistance to calcification, to extend ventricular durability and ensure a longer functional life for the manufactured device. In the present study, an in vitro calcification protocol was used to determine the relative resistance to calcification of six different polyurethanes, namely, Carbothane(R) PC3570A, Chronoflex(R) AR, Corethane(R) 80A, Corethane(R) 55D, Tecoflex(R) EG80A, and Tecothane(R) TT1074A, The results demonstrated that all sis polyurethanes did become calcified during the 60-day incubation period in the calcification solution, The degree of calcification was found to be associated,vith the surface chemistry of the particular polyurethane, with the Tecothane TT1074A exhibiting the highest level. The Corethane 80A and 55D polymers showed a relatively low propensity to calcify. These two membranes can, therefore, be considered as the most appropriate materials for the fabrication of ventricles for a totally implantable artificial heart. In addition, since the calcification occurred primarily at the surface of the membranes, without affecting the bulk microphase structure, the issue of modifying the surface chemistry to reduce the incidence of calcification is discussed.

Macrophages phagocytose orthopedic debris and release the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2. In addition, other immunologic-agents, such as interferon-gamma, are present in tissues harvested from the bone-implant interface of failed orthopedic implants. The present study examined the effects of interferon-gamma on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particle-challenged monocyte/macrophages in vitro. The effects of interferon-gamma were determined by measuring interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release by primary human monocyte/macrophages following exposure to PMMA particles. Exposure of the monocyte/macrophages to PMMA particles resulted in a dose-dependent release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at 48 h. The interleukin-6 release in response to PMMA particle challenge was stimulated by 76% and 127% in the presence of 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL of interferon-gamma, respectively. Interferon-gamma challenge alone did not alter interleukin-6 release relative to controls. In contrast to interleukin-6, interferon-gamma challenge stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha release in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of particles, addition of 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL of interferon-gamma resulted in 17% and 171% increases in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, respectively, relative to cultures challenged solely with particles. Blocking antibody to IFN-gamma inhibited the effect of IFN-gamma on particle-induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release. The data presented in this study demonstrate that the immunologic modulator interferon-gamma exacerbates monocyte/macrophage release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to PMMA particle challenge in vitro.

Polymyxin B (PMB) is a polypeptidic antibiotic which undergoes thermodamage above 60 degrees C. The dynamic compaction method was developed to consolidate the drug load on CaP powder without external heating. Two projectile velocities (50 and 25 m/s) were used here to achieve powder consolidation. Among the different techniques used to associate therapeutic agents with CaP, wet adsorption was performed before the dynamic compaction process. The PMB release profile was measured by a capillary electrophoresis technique, CaP crystallography was studied by x-ray diffraction, and Cap physicochemical analysis was performed by infrared spectroscopy. The biological activities of PMB-loaded compacted CaP were determined by the effect of the antibiotic and monocyte/macroyhage degradation on compact surfaces. PMB release began after 2-3 days of incubation for blocks compacted at 25 m/s velocity and on day 5 for those compacted at 50 m/s velocity, a discrepancy was noted between the amounts of PMB released (0.5-2.1 mg) and the amounts initially compacted (2-8 mg) with CaP powder. The biological activities (antibacterial activity and inhibited lipopolysaccharide effects on monocyte/ macrophage CaP degradation) of PMB released from compacted calcium-deficient apatite were unaltered. Thus, dynamic compaction allows PMB to be used with Cap ceramics without any loss in its integrity and biological effects.

Both materials were injected for periods of 2, 3, 8, or 12 weeks into bone defects at the distal end of rabbit femurs. Quantitative results on new bone formation, BCP resorption, and staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity were studied for statistical purposes. Measurements with scanning electron microscopy and image analysis showed that the final rates of newly formed bone were similar for both tested IBS after 12 weeks of implantation. Bone colonization occurred more extensively during early implantation times for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500. For the latter, BCP degradation occurred regularly throughout the implantation period, whereas it was very intensive during the first 2 weeks for IBS 40-80. Positive TRAP-stained degradation cells were significantly more numerous for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500 regardless of implantation time. With the granulometry of either mineral phase, both tested IBS supported extensive bone colonization, which was greater than that previously reported for an equivalent block of macroporous DCP. The resorption-bone substitution process seemed to occur earlier and faster for IBS 40-80 than for IBS 200-500. Both tested IBS expressed similar biological efficiency, with conserved in vivo bioactivity and bone-filling ability.

To find new synthetic absorbable polymers with plastic nature that can be used as BMP-carrier materials, six types of poly-D,L-lactic acid-polyethylene glycol block copolymer (PLA-PEG) with various molecular weights of PLA and PEG were synthesized. These were PLA6,500-PEG3,000 (P-1), PLA11,500-PEG3,000 (P-2), PLA17,500-PEG3,000 (P-3), PLA6,500-PEG1,000 (P-4), PLA15,000-PEG8,000 (P-5), and PLA8,500-PEG1,000 (P-6). Fifty milligrams of these polymers was mixed with 0 mu g (control) or 5, 10, or 20 mu g of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2). These pellets were implanted into the dorsal muscle pouches of 144 mice (six pellets consisting of the same polymer and dose of rhBMP-2 for a specific group). Three weeks aft-er surgery, the pellets were harvested and examined by radiographic and histological methods. All P-1 pellets with 10 or 20 mu g of rhBMP-2 showed bone formation with hematopoietic marrow and bony trabeculae, as did one third of those with 5 mu g of rhBMP-2. The incidence of new bone formation with P-2 pellets or that of P-5 pellets was lower than that of P-1 pellets. No bone was formed in any other type of pellet. These results indicated that the PLA6,500-PEG3,000 polymer with plastic properties was found to work well as a BMP carrier.

Endothelial cell cultures represent a valuable tool not just in haemocompatibility testing, but also in the concept of designing hybrid organs. In the past endothelial cells (EC) have frequently been used in cytotoxicity testing of materials, especially polymers, used in blood-contacting implants, as well as for investigating seeding technologies for vascular prostheses. At present the exponential development both in theory and practice of cell and molecular biology of the endothelium offers great promise in the biomaterial field. Up until now this EC research field has mostly been non-biomaterial orientated. Nevertheless, the relevance for biomaterial research is apparent. Four aspects will be concisely reviewed under the headings inflammation, with special reference to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and cytokines, angiogenesis, focusing on the healing response, signal transduction, presenting examples from cytokine- and metal ion-induced up-regulation of genes coding for CAMs, and, finally, endothelial functionality, with emphasis on the principal characteristics of the physiological endothelial phenotype. Finally, the application of these fields to three foci of biomaterial research will be discussed, emphasizing the role of EC culture techniques in controlling the host response to biomaterials (microvascular EC), controlling EC functionality (promoting positive effects and down-regulating negative effects), and tissue engineering (integration of EC into hybrid organs/biosensors). The need for more co-culture and three-dimensional models will be stressed and data from the authors' laboratory presented to illustrate these principles.

In an attempt to understand some of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of the control of cell differentiation in the presence of two different materials, Chronoflex (CH) and plasma treated Chronoflex coated with Hyaluronan (CH-HA), we used primary cultures of human myogenic cells, a model that encompasses cell proliferation, migration, fusion, and differentiation dependent gene activation. By testing both the material samples on the growth of human myoblasts in primary cultures, we demonstrated that both CH and CH-HA substrates were able to support the cell growth since they did not affect cell count and DNA synthesis. On the contrary, the degree of myoblast differentiation, assessed as a function of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity on living cells, was completely different on the two biomaterials. Indeed, the amount of CPK increased on CH-HA cultured cells as a result of myotube formation, while CH grown myoblasts remained unfused and displayed no increase on the CPK activity even after 12 days culture. Moreover, the expression level of MyoD and myogenin mRNA, both related to myogenic cell differentiation, appeared extremely low in CH-grown cells, while they were rapidly induced in CH-HA cultured myoblasts.

In this paper, several in vitro and in vivo techniques are presented to demonstrate means of delineating a part of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between biomaterial and macrophage adhesion and phenotypic development. The following conclusions were reached: (1) using radioimmunoassay, complement component C3 was found to be critical in mediating human macrophage adhesion on polyurethanes. (2) The presence of a diphenolic antioxidant additive in polyurethanes increased the propensity for complement upregulation but did not affect adherent macrophage density. (3) The subcutaneous cage-implant system was utilized to delineate interleukin-4 participation in the fusion of adherent macrophages to form foreign body giant cells in vivo in mice. The injection of purified interleukin-4 neutralizing antibody into the implanted cages significantly decreased the giant cell density; conversely, the giant cell density was significantly increased by the injection of recombinant interleukin-4 when compared with the controls. (4) The RGD and PHSRN amino acid sequences of the central cell binding domain and the PRRARV sequence of the C-terminal heparin binding domain of human plasma fibronectin were utilized to study the structure-functional relationship of protein in mediating macrophage behavior. Polyethyleneglycol-based networks grafted with the RGD-containing peptide supported higher adherent human macrophage density than surfaces grafted with other peptides. The formation of foreign body giant cell was highly dependent on the relative orientation between PHSRN and RGD domains located in a single peptide.

In vitro models include the use of bone explant cultures, fetal rat calvarial-derived osteoblast cells, primary stromal populations, transformed and non-transformed cell lines and immortalized osteoblast cell lines. However, these assessments are limited by the extent of osteogenic differentiation and bone formation that can be observed in vitro, species differences and phenotypic drift of cells cultured in vitro. The use of in vivo experimental systems such as the segmental/calvarial bone defect model, the subcutaneous implant model and the diffusion chamber implantation model circumvent some of these issues and, in the appropriate model, provide data on efficacy, biocompatibility and osteointegration of a biomaterial. The combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches together with the development of new cell labeling techniques, in particular the ability to genetically mark and select specific human bone cell populations provides new avenues for their potential evaluation in combination with appropriate biomaterials for clinical use. These in vitro and in vivo techniques are reviewed and those recently developed for assessment of human osteogenic cells should be applicable to many other cell systems where knowledge of specific human tissue or cell interactions with biomaterials is required.

This requires an understanding and appreciation of the biological interactions which occur in the ocular environment and their relevance with respect to the clinical complications associated with surgical implantation of devices. This paper describes the development of a series of clinically reflective in vitro assays for assessing the potential ocular compatibility of novel intraocular lens materials. Staphylococcus epidermidis attachment, fibrinogen adsorption, mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 adhesion and proliferation, primary rabbit lens cell adhesion, human peripheral blood macrophage adhesion and granulocyte activation tests were employed to evaluate two widely used intraocular biomaterials poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone, and a novel biomimetic phosphorylcholine-based coating (PC). The performance of these materials in the in vitro assays was compared to their ability to reduce postoperative inflammation in vivo in a rabbit model. The results demonstrated that the in vitro assays described here are predictive of in vivo ocular compatibility. These assays offer a more relevant means of assessing the ocular compatibility of biomaterials than those presently required by the authorities for regulatory approval of medical devices and implants.

Bacterial adhesion was measured with a clinically relevant Klebsiella pneumoniae type strain and measurements reproduced 12 times.

In this study, we address the use of a degradable gelatin DDS, for the combined release of therapeutic levels of both gentamicin and growth hormone (GH). An initial bolus release was observed during the first 24 h followed by a reduced, but sustained, release for both drugs up to 14 days. Bioactivity of gentamicin was demonstrated by growth inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus for over 96 h with a mean zone of inhibition of 29.4 mm (+/- 0.19) for the time period studied. Furthermore, GH was shown to have a direct effect on primary human osteoblast-like (HOB) cells, stimulating proliferation and enhancing their differentiation. Site-specific drug delivery offers the advantage of localizing a drug directly at the target site, thus minimizing systemic effects. The results of this study suggest that gelatin is a good DDS for the combined release of drugs. In addition, gelatin is both biocompatible and biodegradable, thus making it a promising DDS for the management of acute and chronic bone and tissue infection such as osteomyelitis.

The availability of appropriate biomaterial devices is essential to allow in vitro cultured cells to behave as in the original tissues in vivo. In our studies we utilized a seminatural biomaterial made up by the benzyl ester of hyaluronan to grow keratinocytes, fibroblasts and chondrocytes. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were isolated from human foreskin. Cells were separately cultured on two different hyaluronan based biomaterial devices for the first 15 days and then co-cultured for an additional period of 2 weeks. Keratinocytes gave rise to a well-differentiated epithelial layer, while fibroblasts were able to synthesize all the main extracellular molecules inside the biomaterial spaces, forming dermal-like tissues. When these two tissues were co-cultured, a skin equivalent was formed with a dermal-epidermal junction. Chondrocytes were obtained from chick-embryo sterna and cultured for 21 days inside a non-woven scaffolding made up of a hyaluronan-based biomaterial. Cells were able to organize themselves into nodules embedded in a dense metachromatic substance in which type II collagen was present. Data from this study suggest that this novel class of hyaluronan derived biomaterials is suitable for different cell culture and in vitro tissue reconstruction.

Biodegradable polymer scaffolds can be used as space-filling matrices for tissue development and barriers to migration of epithelial cells in tissue conductive approaches. Inductive approaches involve sustained delivery of bioactive factors, such as protein growth factors and DNA, to alter cell function in localized regions. Factors can be released from highly porous polymer scaffolds to allow factor delivery and tissue development to occur in concert. Cell-based approaches involve seeding of cells onto polymeric scaffolds in vitro and subsequent transplantation of the scaffold. New scaffold materials are being developed that address specific tissue engineering design requirements, and in some cases attempt to mimic natural extracellular matrices. These strategies together offer the possibility of predictably forming specific tissue structures, and may provide solutions to problems such as periodontal ligament detachment, alveolar bone resorption and furcation defects.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Mooney, DJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, 2300 Hayward St,3074 HH Dow Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Murphy, William/I-4096-2014",,,,,50,84,88,1,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0022-3484,,,J PERIODONTAL RES,J.

For this report, the Gemini, a new sampling device for Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflection (HATR) and Diffuse Reflectance (DR) FTIR spectroscopy was evaluated as an option for the study of bovine hides, in successive stages of chrome tanning. Specifically, raw, pickled and chrome sulfate-treated bovine hides were subjected to HATR FTIR analysis so that changes in collagen structure as a function of chemical treatment could be observed. Also, freeze dried hides were examined by DR FTIR in order to detect the presence and structure of collagen-chromium complexes. Comparisons of HATR and DR FTIR show that the expected chemical changes in the hide can be observed. The quality of the spectra obtained is comparable to that reported by biomedical research groups. The GEMINI shows excellent versatility for in-processing hide sampling, enabling the detailed study of many truly unique chemical and biochemical phenomena of the tanning process.","Texas Tech Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; Texas Tech Univ, Leather Res Inst, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; ARS, USDA, Eastern Reg Res Ctr, Wyndmoor, PA 19038 USA","Shelly, DC (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",,,,,,,14,6,6,0,4,AMER LEATHER CHEMISTS ASSN,CINCINNATI,"ROOM 5 CAMPUS STATION-14 TANNER RES LAB, CINCINNATI, OH 45221 USA",0002-9726,,,J AM LEATHER CHEM AS,J.

However, in some applications it is necessary to treat ultra-fine sub-micron particles that have been purposely aggregated to increase their apparent size in order to make centrifugal separation feasible. For some time the possibility of processing of slurries containing aggregates (eg ceramics, minerals, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, biomaterials, etc) has been considered doubtful since it was presumed that shear forces within the hydrocyclone would tend to render such operations ineffective by breaking up the aggregates. The complex mechanisms involved in the separation of aggregates have not allowed a clear understanding of the breakage-separation process, and no model has been available that considers the breakage and separation of particles simultaneously. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of processing dilute suspensions of aggregates using small diameter hydrocyclones by presenting a critical assessment of previous work, and new experimental measurements employing in-situ particle size, density and mass flow measurements for the process streams coupled with robust data reconciliation procedures. A model to describe the breakage-separation phenomenon is proposed and tested. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cells growing from 4 days after subculture (DAS) to 9 DAS and from 16 DAS to 19 DAS showed a diauxic growth, and then growth rapidly decreased with further culturing. The AsA content slowly increased to 19 DAS, reached a maximum at 21 DAS (ca 120 mu g/g dry cell mt), and then rapidly decreased with further culturing. GLDase and ASO activity were well correlated with the cell growth curve, showing a maximum at 19 DAS, whereas APX activity showed a good correlation with the changes in AsA content, showing a maximum at 21 DAS, The total ascorbate contents (reduced form, AsA, and oxidized form, dehydroascorbate, DHA) were markedly enhanced at 10 DAS when L-galactose and L-galactono-1,4-lactone (25 mM) were added to SH medium supplemented with 20 g/l sucrose at 9 DAS, by 5.5 and 6.8 times, respectively.

In addition, 2D macromolecular ordering is of fundamental interest in the areas of phase behavior and complex fluids. Our work involves the growth of 2D streptavidin crystals to examine protein self-assembly at an interface. Streptavidin molecules bound to a biotinylated lipid monolayer self-assemble into ordered arrangements, creating 2D crystals with distinct macroscopic morphologies and lattice configurations. In this paper, we highlight previous work examining the effects of intermolecular interactions on molecular organization and macroscopic properties in ordered protein arrays. We also describe our recent progress using streptavidin mutants to study specific protein-protein interactions and their effects on crystal properties. We show that specific changes in intermolecular interactions give alternate morphological, crystallographic, and thermodynamic properties in ordered monolayers. We introduce an additional growth direction in a crystal with oblique P1 symmetry by engineering extra hydrogen bonds. These extra interactions kinetically trap the crystal in a less-ordered paracrystalline state; however, a solid-solid phase transition to the more-ordered, thermodynamically favored form occurs over time. Removal of this interaction enables molecules to directly form the more-ordered P1 configuration. The introduction of repulsive forces at this site inhibits P1-crystal formation such that crystals with P2 symmetry grow at conditions normally resulting in P1 crystals. Our results confirm that macrosopic and microscopic changes in 2D crystalline properties can be elicited by selectively altering specific intermolecular interactions. Such specific engineered alterations are useful in producing desired crystals and to further our understanding of protein interactions and assembly.","Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gast, AP (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,89,19,19,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5647,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

This model combines the effects of cells (macrophages), transition metal ions (Fe2+), and polymer stress to promote material biodegradation. The cell and material effects of DEX, either in solution or incorporated into a polyetherurethane matrix (DEX/PEU), were monitored. Cell morphology and hydroperoxide formation in the polymer during cell culturing were characterized. After a subsequent treatment with FeCl2 the development of environmental stress cracking in the polymer was evaluated. We attempted to duplicate the biodegradation of PEU in terms of environmental stress cracking (ESC). Our results support the direct involvement of macrophages in polyetherurethane oxidation, probably by inducing hydroperoxide formation in the polymer structure. Under the influence of stress or strain, polymers with sufficient hydroperoxides degrade in the presence of Fe2+ metal ions in a manner that closely resembles the stress cracking that is observed in vivo. By contrast, polymers treated with either agents that inhibit cell activation and/or the oxidative burst, or with cells with no oxidative burst did not show signs of the biodegradative process. We demonstrated a reduction in hydroperoxide formation and no later ESC development in macrophage-cultured PEU in the presence of DEX in solution or in DEX-loaded PEU. We believe the prevention of initial polymer oxidation by reducing the cell's potential to produce oxidative stress at the tissue-biomaterial interface can directly inhibit the ESC degradation of chronically implanted polymers. The in vitro macrophage-Fe-stress system is a valuable tool for reliable assessment and cost-effective evaluation of biomaterials.

Using a rotating disk system, we investigated Staphylococcus epidermidis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to a polyetherurethane urea (PEUU-A') under shear stress (0-17.5 dynes/cm(2)) for time periods up to 6 h. In addition, the superoxide (SO) release capacity of PMNs after transient exposure to PEUU-A' under shear stress was determined. Bacterial adhesion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed a linear shear dependence, decreasing with increasing shear stress. Overall adhesion in PBS decreased with time. However, bacterial adhesion in 25% human serum was similar for all time points up to 360 min. Adhesion was observed at all shear levels, displaying no shear dependence. In contrast, PMN adhesion demonstrated a strong shear dependence similarly for times up to 240 min, decreasing sharply with increasing shear stress. Although PMNs preexposed to shear stress showed a slightly diminished SO release response compared to fresh cells for all stimuli, it was not statistically significant regardless of the stimulus. We conclude that circulating leukocytes are unable to adhere in regions of high shear which may contain adherent bacteria. In addition, exposure to PEUU-A' and shear stress (in the range 0-18 dynes/cm(2)) is insufficient to cause a depression in the oxidative response of PMNs.

In many cases it is not sufficient to just have the three-dimensional structure of a protein in H2O or in the crystalline state. Often information on the structural properties of a protein is required in the presence of organic solvents, detergent micelles, phospholipid membranes and so on. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been identified as one of the few techniques that can be applied for structural characterisation of proteins in such environments.

The changes in molecular weights and thermal properties of PDLLA were studied as a function of the superoxide ion concentration, hydrolysis time, and hydrolysis temperature. The superoxide ion induced fragmentation of PDLLA yielded a mixture of various species with different chain length. A combined size exclusion chromatography (SEC) method with a chemical tagging by phenyl isocyanate revealed that the structure of the oligomer species with the lowest molecular weight formed in the superoxide ion induced degradation mixture was linear. The significant reduction in T-g was consistent with the significant reduction in the molecular weight; of PDLLA, The linear low molecular fragments (dimers and trimers) in the reaction mixture could act as an internal plasticizers to enhance the T-g reduction by increasing the free volume of chain ends. The relationship of T-g with molecular weight of PDLLA followed the general theory of Fox-Flory. The mechanism of simple hydrolysis of ester by superoxide ion proposed by Forrester et al. was modified to interpret the data obtained from the synthetic biodegradable polymers.

Posterolateral lumbar transverse process fusion using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 carried by sintered bovine bone and Type I collagen complex was compared with fusion achieved using autogenous bone graft or sintered bovine bone alone. Objectives. This study examined the efficacy of sintered bovine bone coated with Type I collagen as a carrier of rhBMP-2 for lumbar intertransverse process arthrodesis. Summary of Background Data. Posterolateral intertransverse process arthrodesis using osteoinductive growth factors is performed experimentally in the lumbar spine. The previous studies revealed the efficacy of osteoinductive factors applied to carriers having no bony structures, such as collagen sheet or polylactic acid polymer, for the spinal fusion. However, in their studies, a large amount of osteoinductive proteins have been applied for the spinal fusion. We used the sintered bovine bone ""True Bone Ceramics"" (TBC; Koken Co., Tokyo, Japan) coated with type I collagen as the carrier. True Bone Ceramics is the only biomaterial possessing a natural trabecular structure and an organized crystal of bone minerals. Methods. Twenty-two adult rabbits underwent bilateral lumbar intertransverse process arthrodesis at L4-L5. The animals were divided into four groups and had materials implanted as follows: autologous bone group, grafted autologous corticocancellous bone harvested from the posterior iliac crest; implanted TBC group; TBC collagen group, implanted TBC coated with Type I collagen infiltrating into the porous space; and BMP group, implanted sintered bovine bone coated with Type I collagen infiltrated with 100 mu g of rhBMP-2. Spinal fusion was evaluated by radiographic analysis, manual palpation, biomechanical testing, and histologic examination 6 weeks after surgery. Results. Two rabbits were killed because of infection and lumbar plexus palsy. Radiographs of the BMP group showed a homogeneous fusion mass at the intertransverse area, and stability was confirmed by dynamic radiographs at 3 and 6 weeks after surgery. In the BMP group, a bony mass in the intertransverse a rea was more prominent than in the other groups. The BMP group had a higher fusion rate based on manual palpation than the-other groups, and BMP fusions showed significantly higher tensile strength and stiffer fusion. The histologic findings in the BMP group demonstrated membranous bone and endochondral bone formations between the transverse process and the fusion mass. In the other groups, continuous trabecular bone formation was observed in the:area surrounding the transverse process, but gaps between grafted fragments and less mature bone formation were present in the intertransverse area. Conclusions. Sintered bovine bone coated with Type-1 collagen and rhBMP-2 resulted in a higher fusion rate than the autograft and can be used as a carrier for rh-BMP-2 in spinal fusion.","Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, Wakayama 6410012, Japan","Minamide, A (reprint author), Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 6410012, Japan.",minamide@wakayama-med.ac.jp,,,,,,46,35,50,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0362-2436,1528-1159,,SPINE,SPINE,SEP 15,1999.0,24,18,,,,,1863,1870,,10.1097/00007632-199909150-00002,,,,8,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,238BV,WOS:000082691800001,10515009.0,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies focused on hexafluoroethane (C2F6, HFE) and tetrafluoroethylene (C2F4, TFE) as the monomer precursor have shown such surfaces to exhibit unique protein binding capabilities. In this study, slow, surface directed deposition of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6, HFP) films is shown to confer surface functional group presentation that promotes high protein retention. The surface chemistry is controllable over a range of values, and C3F6 films prepared by RF-glow discharge are smooth, homogeneous, and defect free. Surface patterns of the fluoropolymer can be created by direct or photolithographic techniques. Scanning probe microscopic analysis indicates a surface modulus in the range of 1.2 < E-HFP < 5.5 GPa. These results are discussed in terms of the applicability of C3F6 films for coating biomaterials. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

To understand the conformation change under different forces, Glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergilius Niger was used as a protein model. Eight glycolipids(1,2-o-dialkyl-3-o-beta-D-glycosylglycerols and alkyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside) were used as the matrixes for this investigation. It was observed that the GOD can penetrate into neutral glycolipid monolayer and change its conformation in favor of the alpha-helix formation. Moreover, GOD strongly adsorbed to the positive charged glycolipid monolayer and change its conformation in favor of the beta-sheet formation. Enzymatic activity measurements showed that the more the alpha-helix conformation content is in the GOD, the higher activity the GOD will be. This fact suggested a new way to mediate the conformation of protein in organized molecular assemblies, and provided a new thinking for the preparation of biomimetic film and biosensor.

Equivalent endotoxin levels associated with the material were <0.03 EU/mL for all materials but two; for polyHEMA, the most contaminated material, it was 0.23 EU/mL. Films of the materials were incubated with freshly isolated rat peritoneal macrophages for 6 to 24 h before the TNF alpha levels in the supernatant were analyzed for biological activity, using L929 cells as a target. When endotoxin was added, far greater quantities of TNF alpha were generated at 24 h compared to 6 h, but still there was little effect with regard to material chemistry.

At pH values > 8.0, epoxide groups of BDDGE will react with amine groups of collagen. The effects of BDDGE concentration, pH, time, and temperature were studied. Utilization of a 4-wt % BDDGE instead of 1-wt % resulted in a faster reaction. Whereas similar values of shrinkage temperature were obtained, fewer primary amine groups bad reacted at a lower BDDGE concentration, which implies that the crosslinking reaction had a higher efficacy. An:increase in pH from 8.5 to 10.5 resulted in a faster reaction but reduced crosslink efficacy. Furthermore, an increase in reaction temperature accelerated the reaction without changing the crosslink efficacy. Crosslinking under acidic conditions (pH < 6.0) evoked a reaction between epoxide groups and carboxylic acid groups of collagen. Additional studies showed that no oligomeric crosslinks could be formed. However, hydrolysis of the epoxide groups played a role in the crosslink mechanism especially under acidic reaction conditions. The macroscopic properties of these materials were dependent on the crosslinking method. Whereas a flexible and soft tissue was found if crosslinking was performed at pH < 6.0, a stiff sponge was obtained under alkaline conditions. Reaction of DSC with a monofunctional compound (glycidyl isopropyl ether) led to comparable trends in reaction rate and in similar macroscopical differences in materials as observed with BDDGE.

Design: Five-year retrospective review of clinical cases with at least 2-year follow-up. Patients: A cohort of 60 consecutive private patients with complaints of malar hypoplasia or facial asymmetry. Setting: A plastic surgery clinic. Intervention: Silastic midfacial malar implants were fitted in each patient. Most underwent implantation via the canine fossa approach and in conjunction with another facial plastic procedure. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective patient satisfaction, photographic grading using a visual analog scale, and complications. Results: Of the 60 patients, 51 (85.0%) reported an excellent result after at least a 2-year follow-up. Ten patients (16.7%) had some form of undesirable sequelae; however, only 4 (3.4%) of 118 implants had to be revised. Photographically, all 60 patients graded postoperative improvement. Conclusions: Findings support the contention that the Silastic midfacial malar implant is a safe and effective alloplastic alternative to treat malar hypoplasia and facial asymmetry. The complication and revision rates are acceptable. Relative technical ease of insertion makes malar augmentation an excellent adjunct for rhytidectomy and rhinoplasty.","Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Div Facial Plast Surg, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; McCollough Plast Surg Clin PA, Birmingham, AL USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Lexington, KY USA","Metzinger, SE (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, 2020 Gravier St,Suite A, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",,,,,,,15,21,21,0,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0886-4470,,,ARCH OTOLARYNGOL,Arch.

The distribution of the specific proteins adsorbed on the membrane surface was also determined by a gold-colloid immunoassay. Albumin, gamma-globulin and fibrinogen were observed on every membrane surface after contact with plasma. However, in the case of the blended membrane, the density of the adsorbed proteins decreased compared with that of original PSf membrane.

Setting and working times of the cement pastes, compressive strength, un-notched fracture strength, Young's modulus, fracture toughness and toughness were evaluated for the cements. In contrast to previous studies the aluminium to silicon ratio was not found to influence the cement properties significantly. The high phosphorus content of the glasses studied is thought to reduce the influence of the aluminium to silicon ratio of the glass, as a result of phosphorus locally charge balancing four coordinate aluminium ions in the glass network, as well as providing an additional mechanism of degradation in the form of hydrolysable phosphorus-oxygen bonds.

Bioglass(R) discs were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to preform a calcium phosphate surface layer and subsequently immersed in blank, bovine serum albumin (BSA)- and rM179-containing supersaturated calcification solutions (SCSB, SCSBSA and SCSrM179), respectively. Calcium phosphate layers formed on all the treated samples and were characterized to be apatite by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transmission infrared spectrophotometry. Under scanning electron microscopy, plate-shaped crystals (similar to 50 nm thick and 300-600 nm across) were observed on the samples after PBS incubation. The crystals grown from SCSB were of the typical plate shape except for an increased thickness, while needle-shaped crystals (200-300 nm long and 50-70 nm thick) were precipitated on the SCSBSA-immersed samples. Interestingly, it was found that the crystals deposited on the SCSrM179-immersed samples adopted an elongated, curved shape (similar to 500 nm long and similar to 120 nm thick). Further TEM observations showed that the crystals generated by the SCSrM179 immersion appeared to be composed of bundles of lengthwise crystals (15-20 nm thick) orientated parallel to one another, much alike the long and thin crystals observed in the very early stage of enamel formation. The significant modulation by the rM179 protein of apatite crystal growth is quite different from the overall inhibition observed by BSA and most likely is relevant to the specific function of the amelogenin matrix in controlling enamel crystal growth in vivo.

In particular, an ideal bone-biomaterial would support the activity of osteoblasts in the development of new bone, while simultaneously being resorbed by osteoclasts as part of the lifelong orderly process of bone remodelling. Such resorbable calcium phosphate-based thin films and bulk ceramics have now been created by the high-temperature processing of a fine precipitate, formed from a colloidal sol and stabilized using an additive such as silicon. The materials have two characteristic features: a phase composition which is a mixture of calcium hydroxyapatite and a silicon stabilized tricalcium phosphate, and a microporous morphology based on inter-connected particles (0.2-1 mu m in diameter). X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and light scattering experiments indicate that the characteristic phase composition arises during sintering through substitution reactions where silicon enters the calcium phosphate lattice under conditions of high chemical reactivity. The crystallographic features are linked through the glaserite form of the apatite structure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods: Resins contained one of the epoxies: diglycidyl ether Bisphenol A (GY-6004); 3,4-epoxycyclohexanemethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (UVR-6105); vinyl cyclohexane dioxide (ERL-4206) or the three-epoxy mixture (Epoxy-M). The SOC was t/t-2,3,8,9-di(tetramethylene)-1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane (SOC). The polyols were polytetrahydrofuran (p-THF-250) and polycaprolactone triol (TONE-301). The photoinitiator (4-octylphenyl)phenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate and camphorquinone were used for light curing the resins. Four types of resins (epoxy, SOC/epoxy, polyol/epoxy and SOC/polyol/epoxy) were evaluated for cytotoxicity as solids in the agar diffusion assay and as aqueous extracts in the MTT assay using L929 cells. Results: In agar diffusion analysis, ERL-4206 and UVR-6105 resins were severely cytotoxic (+ + +), but the addition of SOC changed them to non-cytotoxic (-). Addition of 1-3% SOC changed Epoxy-M from mild (+) to non-cytotoxic. Adding SOC changed GY-6004 from moderate (+ +) to mild (-) cytotoxicity. Generally, addition of SOC did not change cytotoxicity when added to polyol/epoxy combinations. Either polyol produced resins with reduced cytotoxicity when added to UVR-6105, but the opposite occurred when added to Epoxy-M resins. In MTT analysis, percent cell survival from 100 mu l resin extracts were statistically compared (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Epoxy-M and GY-6004 resin extracts were significantly less cytotoxic than UVR-6105 and ERL-4206 resin extracts were. Overall, the SOC component reduced the cytotoxicity of all SOC/epoxy combinations, except SOC/ERL-4206, which was significantly more cytotoxic than ERL-4206 resin extract. This may be the result of cell fixative effects observed for SOC/ERL-4206 in agar diffusion analysis. Addition of SOC produced significantly less cytotoxic SOC/polyol/Epoxy-M resins when compared to its non-SOC counterpart. The contrary result was obtained with SOC/polyol/UVR-6105 resin combinations. Consistent with agar diffusion results, adding polyol significantly decreased cytotoxicity of UVR-6105 resins. The cytotoxicity of these resins may be related to the 50% cytotoxicity (TC50) of their components as leachates. The TC50 values of the individual components were compared to BISGMA. Polyols, epoxy monomers, SOC monomer and camphorquinone were significantly(p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than BISGMA. Significance: Addition of SOCs and polyols in the formulation of epoxy-based resins may contribute to development of biocompatible dental composites. (C) 1999 Academy of Dental Materials.

Human gingival fibroblasts were obtained from tissue biopsies of five donors and were cultivated up to 5 weeks under three-dimensional culture conditions. The cells displayed an elongated, spindle-like or stellate morphology resembling the in vivo situation. Collagen type I revealed thick fiber bundles, and collagens type Zn and V were distributed as fine fibrils or small bundles throughout the culture system. Frequently, the fibers were oriented parallel to the long axis of the cells, Type VI collagen formed thin fibers and revealed a reticular pattern. In histological sections the cultured cells exhibited a morphology clearly different from that of cells cultured in monolayers, Their shape and spatial distribution resembled that of cells in tissue biopsies more closely The culture system presented here promotes a dynamic model for performing studies for instance on the interactions of cultured cells with extracellular matrix molecules, on the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes or on the interactions with biomaterials, thus providing qualitative and quantitative information.","Med Univ Hannover, Dept Conservat Dent & Periodontol, Sch Med, D-30623 Hannover, Germany; Med Univ Hannover, Ctr Anat, D-30623 Hannover, Germany","Hillmann, G (reprint author), Med Univ Hannover, Dept Conservat Dent & Periodontol, Sch Med, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,43,22,29,1,4,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0021-9533,,,J CELL SCI,J.

The authors review the presentations and relevant literature on biomaterials in the face. The following topics are reviewed: current reconstructive techniques using autogenous bone grafts, methyl methacrylate cranioplasty, demineralized bone, and hydroxyapatite; biomaterials used for rigid fixation, including metallic and bioabsorbable implants; biomaterials used for facial augmentation, including porous polyethylene, hard-tissue replacement, and ceramic biomaterials; biofilm, or a layered polysaccharide matrix secreted by bacteria on the surface of implants; and potential means of inducing bone formation by directing the body's own tissues through cytokine interaction, gene transfer, and tissue engineering.","Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Plast Surg, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Plast Surg, New Haven, CT USA","Gosain, AK (reprint author), Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Plast Surg, 9200 W Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",,,,,,,48,62,65,2,16,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1049-2275,1536-3732,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

A new method for in vitro calcification is employed, in parallel with an in vivo (subcutaneous animal) model. The nature of crystal phases grown by both methods on porcine bioprosthetic heart valves was investigated. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and stoichiometric chemical analysis were used as tools for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the calcification process. Photomicrographs from leaflets calcified early in vitro (24-48 h) and in vivo (5-10 days) confirmed that calcification initiated in the central region of the tissue, mainly in fibrosa, and extended with time (after 28 and 56 days) in vivo towards the outer surface of the tissue. SEM micrographs from tissue sections of early in vivo and in vitro calcified leaflets showed coexistence of different sizes (1-30 mu m) of crystal phases in contact with tissue fibers. EDS analysis confirmed that the deposits were calcium phosphate salts. Chemical analysis of samples calcified in vivo for longer time periods, showed that the content of the salts was mainly calcium and phosphate with a Ca/P molar ratio 1.78 and 1.94 after 28 and 56 days, respectively. These results suggested that the calcification process is followed by a sequential hydrolytic transformation of CaHPO4. 2H(2)O (DCPD) to Ca4H(PO4)(3). 2.5H(2)O (OCP) and to Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH (HAP). Calcium phosphate crystal phases grown in vitro under controlled conditions and at constant super-saturation provide a successful simulation of the calcification process in the animal model and may be applied in screening new biomaterials with respect to their potential for calcification.

The aim of the study was to investigate the features of titanium oxide and titanium nitride layers produced on titanium alloy by plasma nitriding and oxidizing under glow discharge conditions and their biocompatibility in in vitro tests. The plasma nitriding and oxidizing techniques essentially improved the properties of titanium alloys. Their microstructure and the results of hardness, wear and corrosion resistance tests are presented. In the investigations of the, cellular responses of human fibroblast cells to these layers, three aspects were considered: the number of growing cells, their morphological features and their biological corrosion resistance. Nitriding and oxidizing under glow discharge conditions have provided new possibilities of producing non-toxic, human fibroblast-compatible surface layers on parts made of titanium alloys with sophisticated shapes, Uniform surface layers having a controlled microstructure and phase composition can contribute to the opening of a wider application range of titanium alloys as biomaterials.

Ultraviolet light irradiation under sequential charge of vinyl monomers, such as acrylic acid (AA), n-butyl methacrylate (BMA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] acrylamide (DMAPAAm), or styrene (ST), produced block-grafted surfaces, in which different polymer blocks were sequentially formed on polyST (PST) partially derivatized with N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate groups. Examination of a cross-sectional view under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed a bilayered structure of the PST-b-PDMAAm block-graft copolymer. Three different AB-type block-graft-copolymerized surfaces were prepared for biomedical applications, where block A was the bottom layer and block B the top layer: (1) For heparin immobilization, a polyPDMAPAAm (PDMAPAAm) (A)-polyDMAAm (PDMAAm) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block A layer contained ionically immobilized heparin and the block: B layer functioned as a protective layer to suppress protein adsorption and cell adhesion. (2) For protein immobilization, a PDMAAm (A)-polyAA(PAA) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block B layer covalently fixed the protein and the block A layer functioned as a protective layer to prevent contact of the protein with the substrate. (3) For a drug-releasing surface, a PDMAAm (A)-polyBMA (PBMA) (B) block-graft-copolymerized surface was prepared, where the block A layer contained the drug and the block B layer functioned as a barrier to regulate drug release. These macromolecularly designed surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the immobilization of heparin and protein was visualized by light microscopy, after staining with toluidine blue (for heparin), and fluorescence microscopy (for protein).","Natl Cardiovasc Ctr, Res Inst, Dept Bioengn, Suita, Osaka 5658565, Japan","Matsuda, T (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maedashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.",,,,,,,36,57,59,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,AUG 17,1999.0,15,17,,,,,5560,5566,,10.1021/la981581x,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,228EV,WOS:000082124900022,,,,,2019-02-25

Viability was determined before and after freeze-drying and after heat treatment (100 min at 70 degrees C). Freeze-drying with trehalose, PVP, maltose or 1.8-kDa maltodextrin, and mixtures of maltodextrin/ trehalose increased viability in comparison with controls. The 3.6-kDa maltodextrin was ineffective at protecting the cells during freeze-drying. The glass transition temperature (T-g), which depends on moisture content, was indicated as a possible factor to determine the stability of labile materials. Protective effects of the excipients during thermal treatment were analysed in relation to the physical changes (collapse or structural shrinkage) which were dependent on the T-g of the systems. The presence of a certain amount of amorphous disaccharides during freeze-drying and heating was found to be a critical factor for ensuring cell viability, which was protected even in rubbery (above T-g) matrices.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ind, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Quim, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Buera, MP (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ind, Ciudad Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Buera, Pilar/0000-0001-9290-7299",,,,32,58,63,1,10,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0175-7598,,,APPL MICROBIOL BIOT,Appl.

Granules of natural coral of specific diameter, between 100 and 500 mu m, having high content of calcium (> 98%) and a homogeneous surface adsorb glycosaminoglycans with different capacity. Heparin (maximum adsorption 1.29 +/- 0.10 mg/20 mg of coral, 6.45% w/w) is adsorbed more than highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate species (maximum adsorption of 0.90 +/- 0.06 mg/20 mg of coral, 4.50% w/w), chondroitin sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.72 +/- 0.06 mg/ 20 mg of coral, 3.60% w/w), dermatan sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mg/20 mg of coral, 3.50% w/w) and heparan sulfate (maximum adsorption of 0.72 +/- 0.07 mg/20 mg of coral, 3.60% w/w). Hyaluronan is not adsorbed onto granules of coral. The percentage adsorption of polyanions onto coral depends mainly on their charge density, with sulfate groups being more important than carboxyl groups. This study found no evidence that iduronic acid is more important than glucuronic acid and no role of molecular mass on the adsorption of polysaccharides onto coral was found. The adsorption of glycosaminoglycans is driven by electrostatic interactions with calcium sites of coral that are dependent on pH and blocked in the presence of large amounts of salt. Due to these peculiar properties, the combination of granules of natural coral with glycosaminoglycans makes this material potentially useful in osseointegration in bone metabolism or periodontal therapy.

Because polydimethyl siloxane surfaces have good hemo- and bio-compatibility, it is generally believed that surface biocompatibility may be improved by modifying biomaterial surfaces with silicone-like properties. For this, we developed a series of polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone (PDMS-PCL) copolymers. By mixing the substrate material-polyvinyl chloride-with law concentrations (1.2 and 2.4%) of the PDMS-PCL copolymer, we generated materials with silicone-like surface properties as reflected by increased surface silicon content and surface contact angles. We assessed the biocompatibility of these surfaces in vitro and found that the addition of PDMS-PCL significantly reduced the percentages of surface-'denatured' fibrinogen, a critical element of genesis of many adverse responses to implanted biomaterials. Indeed, using an animal implantation model, we find that PDMS-PCL-blended materials triggered significantly weaker inflammatory responses than did polyvinyl chloride, the substrate control. The results from these experiments suggest that the use of PDMS-PCL additives (2.4%) in polymer blends is a useful means of camouflaging the substrate surface properties and improving the biocompatibility of biomaterials.

However, knowledge of the origins and phenotypic characteristics of these progenitors and the controlling factors that govern bone formation and remodeling to give a functional skeleton adequate for physiological needs is limited, Practical methods are currently being investigated to amplify in in vitro culture the appropriate autologous cells to aid skeletal healing and reconstruction. Recent advances in the fields of biomaterials, biomimetics, and tissue engineering have focused attention on the potentials for clinical application, Current cell therapy procedures include the use of tissue-cultured skin cells for treatment of burns and ulcers, and in orthopedics, the use of cultured cartilage cells for articular defects. As mimicry of natural tissues is the goal, a fuller understanding of the development, structures, and functions of normal tissues is necessary. Practically all tissues are capable of being repaired by tissue engineering principles. Basic requirements include a scaffold conducive to cell attachment and maintenance of cell function, together with a rich source of progenitor cells. In the latter respect, bone is a special case and there is a vast potential for regeneration from cells with stem cell characteristics. The development of osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipoblasts, myoblasts, and fibroblasts results from colonies derived from such single cells. They may thus, theoretically, be useful for regeneration of all tissues that this variety of cells comprise: bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendons, and ligaments. Also relevant to tissue reconstruction is the field of genetic engineering, which as a principal step in gene therapy would be the introduction of a functional specific human DNA into cells of a patient with a genetic disease that affects mainly a particular tissue or organ, Such a situation is pertinent to osteogenesis imperfecta, for example, where in more severely affected individuals any improvements in long bone quality would be beneficial to the patient. In conclusion, the potentials for using osteogenic stem cells and biomaterials in orthopedics for skeletal healing is immense, and work in this area is likely to expand significantly in the future, (Bone 25:5S-9S; 1999) (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Three delays (12, 24, and 52 weeks) were used. Before death, a double label of oxytetracycline and alizarine was made intravenously, The distribution of implants was randomized, histomorphometric evaluation was performed and compared with micrographic observation, and optical microscopy of stained sections was performed either under visible, ultraviolet, or polarized light, The results were compared with spontaneous healing of empty defects and with a control group of normal cancellous bone from sheeps of the same age. No significant difference has been observed between premolded and injected implants. In the sheep model, the degradation and new bone formation rates are three times slower, compared with those observed previously in rabbits. New bone formation increased from 5.9% (12 weeks) up to 11.0% (24 weeks) in the empty defect group. In the cement groups, 28.3% new bone was obtained at 12 weeks, which seemed then to level off (27.8% new bone at 24 weeks), Cement residues appear as radio-opaque cylinders on microradiographs, In all cases, a radiolucent layer was observed at the cement/bone interface at 24 weeks, Stained sections showed the formation of a fibroconnective capsule around the residual cement, which presumably slows down new bone formation. Nevertheless, quantitative bone remodeling was accelerated in the cement group; mineral apposition as well as adjusted apposition rates were higher, and the formation period as well as the mineralization of osteoid tissue vl ere faster compared with empty cavities and controls, These results point to higher osteoblast activity and better exchange with surrounding tissues in the defects filled with cement, (Bone 25:35S-39S; 1999) (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

We have developed proprietary polyester copolymers including lactic acid moieties and present here results concerning the effect of sterilization on the physico-chemical properties of derived bone biomaterials, Chitosan solutions show a dramatic decrease in viscosity after 25-kGy gamma sterilization, Aqueous copolylactic solutions also show, by capillary electrophoresis, that hydrolysis occurs to liberate monomers after 25-kGy gamma sterilization, Heat sterilization also degrades chitosan solutions, and ultrafiltration is difficult because of high viscosity. However, apatite-copolylactic solids can he steam sterilized without deterioration. Gelatin has been used as a natural polymer to bind apatite particles. Gel exclusion chromatography reveals crosslinking of the chains by irradiation. Standard acrylic cements contain monomers sterilized by ultrafiltration because they do not tolerate irradiation. We have used ultrafiltration to prepare aqueous copolylactic solutions without polymer hydrolysis, Implantation of calcium phosphate cement modified by; copolylactic acid in a rabbit metaphyseal model defect shows progressive substitution of the biomaterial by new bone tissue. At 3 months, a mild inflammatory reaction still remains associated with the continuing resorption of the biomaterial. These results show that interesting biological properties can be obtained with products not sterilized by irradiation.

A large part of the studies has investigated PEG coatings. Nevertheless, there is still controversy about what exactly the properties and modes of action of an 'ideal' PEG coating should be. While some studies have reported no irreversible protein adsorption, other, very similar coatings appear less able to resist bioadhesion. Of great interest are results showing that PEG surfaces with very short chains are capable of rejecting proteins. As it is very difficult to obtain direct information about the microstructure of the coatings, studies typically employ plausible models to interpret observations. New analytical techniques and the direct measurement of interfacial forces between proteins and surfaces open up the possibility of improved, guided design and feedback in the optimization of surfaces intended to resist bioadhesion.

A novel function estimation method was used to extract the material functions from experimental shear data obtained at one strain rate, and the model was used to predict the material response at different strain rates. In general, experiments and predictions were in good agreement, the larger discrepancies being in the prediction of peak stresses and hysteresis in cyclic shear. In shear, Jived tissues are stiffer (mean initial shear modulus, 13 kPa versus 427 Pa), take longer to relax to steady state (mean tau(2) 4,736 s versus 1,764 s) with a slower initial relaxation rate (mean magnitude of (G) over dot(0), 1 s(-1) versus 5 s(-1)) and relax to a lesser extent than fresh tissues (mean percentage stress remaining after relaxation, 60 versus 45 percent). All differences were significant at p = 0.04 or less, except for the initial relaxation slope.

Two processing procedures, paraffin and glycol methacrylate, were tested on three in vitro groups of poly-L-lactide sponges, high cell density seeding, low cell density seeding, and a control.

By analogy with glycosaminoglycan heparin, a natural highly charged anionic polysaccharide that exerts: a variety of biological effects, vpe postulated that CMDBS compounds also possess binding sites capable of specific interactions with biological constituents, depending on the overall composition of the polymer. The synthesis and heparin-like properties of these CMDBS have been extensively investigated. Thus, it appears that dextran derivatives can mimic the action of heparin in regard to its interactions with antithrombin and serine proteases involved in blood coagulation. Other derivatives interact with various components of the immune system or with adhesive proteins such as fibronectin in modulating the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus. Because they are able to stimulate wound healing in various in vivo models, these polysaccharides may also constitute a family of tissue repair agents because of their protecting and potentiating effects with heparin binding growth factors, Moreover, dextran derivatives in contact with cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or tumoral cells can affect both cell proliferation and metabolism. IL appears that these bioactive polymers are also efficient tools to investigate the precise mechanism of action of individual biological activities by contrasting their mode of action to that of heparin, In addition to their numerous biological properties and biospecificity, functionalized dextrans are relatively simple to manufacture and exempt of donor contaminant, which make them attractive in a variety of clinical applications.

We recently demonstrated that the erythroleukemic cell line K562, which normally grows in suspension, can be induced to grow attached to a polylysine-coated solid surface in an anchorage-dependent manner. In this study, the effects of the growth of K562 cells onto polylysine were further investigated utilizing 500 MHz H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The NMR results showed that when K562 cells are grown attached to a positively-charged polylysine surface, there are alterations in lipids and energy metabolism. In particular, there was a 31% increase in phosphatidylcholine and a 15% decrease in each of its two precursors, glycerophosphatidylcholine and choline, as well as a 20% increase in CH2 lipids and a 7% decrease in CH3 lipids in treated cells compared to the controls. These results suggest that adhesive growth can induce strong variations in membrane structure, including the membrane fluidity of K562 cells. In addition, in cells attached to polylysine there was about a 10% decrease in creatine (together with phosphocreatine), a 20% increase in gamma-glutamate, a 15% increase in beta-glutamate, and a 24% decrease in lactate. This second set of results, which is closely related to energy metabolism, indicates that not only does adhesive growth induce changes in K562 cell membrane structure, but also in the utilization of energy in these cells. The data are discussed in view of the possible role played by surface charge in affecting cell structure and function in cells that come into direct contact with charged biopolymers.

A quadratic response-surface model was developed in order to study the effects of treatment time and temperature (in the range of 1000 degrees C to 1250 degrees C) on scale thickness. The obtained model adequately represents the experimental response and shows that the thickness gradients of the layer increase with the temperature for each exposure time and decrease steadily to zero as the treatment time increases. The microstructural characterization reveals that the alumina scale formed at or above 1000 degrees C consists of an alpha-alumina phase. Treatments at temperatures above 1150 degrees C give rise to an alumina scale with some defect probability. An increase in the temperature up to 1200 degrees C gives rise to the appearance of some blistering of the superficial scale. An oxidation treatment of 100 h at 1100 degrees C was found to be the best for guaranteeing the formation of a defect-free, compact, adherent, and continuous oc-alumina scale thick enough to support satisfactory wear and biological conditions.

Both were two-part epoxies cured at room temperature for 24 h, with material 1 (Ampreg 26; SP Systems Limited, Cowes, UK) postcured at 110 degrees C (T-g similar to 80 degrees C) and Material 2 (CG5052; Ciba Geigy Limited, Cambridge, UK) at 125 degrees C (T-g similar to 120 degrees C). Implantation in dead rabbit bone was performed to provide mechanical baseline levels. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and conventionally HA-coated titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) were used as control materials. In the biological study, different fluorescent dyes were used to label newly formed bone. After 6 weeks of implantation, results from mechanical pushout tests showed that the interfacial shear strength (ISS) values were significantly higher than for dead bones with each of the different implants (p < .01-.001). HA-coated material 2 showed a significantly higher ISS value than the uncoated material (p <.05) after 6 weeks' implantation. However, the ISS value for the uncoated material 2 was significantly higher than for PMMA controls (p <.05). No significant differences in the TSS values were shown between HA-coated materials 1 and 2 and Ti-6Al-4V on in vivo implantation for 6 weeks. Failure points of the pushout test from the three HA-coated materials were defined by scanning electron microscopy. Specimens implanted with both HA-coated epoxies were fractured within the HA-coatings or the bone, while with HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V cracked between the coating and metal implant. The percentage of bone in contact with the implant surface was obtained by image analysis which showed that there were no significant differences between different materials after short time implantation (up to 6 week). Longterm implantation of the HA-coated material 2 showed that the percentage of bone contact had increased from 52.8 +/- 1.1% (6 week) to 80.0 +/- 0.3% (3 months) (p <.01) and remained at 81.0 +/- 0.8% (6 months). Measurements of bone mineralization rate (BMR) showed that after 3 weeks of implantation, there were no significant differences between PMMA and uncoated materials 1 and 2. After 6 weeks, the BMRs in animals implanted with either HA-coated material 1 or 2 were significantly higher than with HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V (p <.05-.0001 in both cases), but with HA-coated material 2 was lower than with this material uncoated (p <.05-.001). No significant differences were found between the two HA-coated epoxy materials. In addition, there were always lower BMRs during the third week of implantation than other periods regardless of biomaterial implanted. The study indicated that the adhesively bonded HA-coated novel epoxy materials were superior to conventional plasma-sprayed Ti-6Al-4V implants with respect to both BMR and bone integration with the implant surfaces. Adhesively bonded HA-coated epoxy materials had similar ISS values to HA-coated Ti-6Al-4V, but the former failed within the bone and coating, while the latter showed splitting between coating and metal.

In the present study, are evaluated histologically and mechanically the effect of alumina crystallinity on the osteoconductivity and bone-bonding strength of the composite. AL-P was manufactured by fusing crushed alpha-alumina powder and quenching it. The AL-P was composed mainly of amorphous and delta-crystal phases of alumina. Its average particle size was 3.5 mu m, and it took a spherical form. Another composite (alpha ALC), filled with pure alpha-alumina powder (alpha AL-P), was used as a referential material. The proportion of powder added to each composite was 70% w/w. Mechanical testing of ABC and alpha ALC indicated that they would be strong enough for use under weight-bearing conditions. The affinity indices for ABC, determined using male Wistar rat tibiae, were significantly higher than those for alpha ALC (p < 0.0001) up to 8 weeks. Composite plates (15 x 10 x 2 mm) that had an uncured surface layer on one side were made in situ in a rectangular mold. One of the plates was implanted into the proximal metaphysis of the tibia of a male Japanese white rabbit, and the failure load was measured by a detaching test 10 weeks after implantation. The failure loads for ABC on its uncured surface [1.91 +/- 1.23 kgf (n = 8)] were significantly higher than those for alpha ALC on its uncured surface [0.35 +/- 0.33 kgf (n = 8); (p < 0.0001)], and they also were significantly higher than those for ABC on the other (cured surface) side (p < 0.0001). Histological examinations using rabbit tibiae revealed bone ingrowth into the composite only on the uncured surface of ABC. This study revealed that the amorphous phase of alumina and formation of an uncured surface layer are needed for the osteoconductive and bone-bonding ability of ABC. ABC shows promise as a basis for the development of a highly osteoconductive and mechanically strong biomaterial.

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London, United Kingdom. Methods: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (Alcon Surgical, model MC60BM) and AcrySof (Alcon Surgical, model MA60BM) IOLs were incubated in physiological concentrations of radiolabeled albumin or fibronectin at 37 degrees C for periods between 5 minutes and 1 week. The IOLs were removed and rinsed in buffered saline, and the amount of adsorbed protein was calculated by measuring the radioactivity with scintillation spectrometry. Results: The adsorption of both proteins occurred rapidly over the first 2 hours; the rate of adsorption was concentration dependent. Quantitative differences were found: PMMA lenses bound significantly greater quantities of albumin. initial fibronectin adsorption to both materials was similar, but increased adsorption to AcrySof IOLs was found at days 1 and 7. Conclusions: The differences in protein absorption to PMMA and AcrySof IOLs in vitro may contribute to the differences in the biological response to these IOLs, including the lower rates of posterior capsule opacification associated with acrylic lenses.

At pH 2.0, these biomass types were capable of sequestering up to 8.0 mu mol g(-1), 7.2 mu mol g(-1) and 3.2 mu mol g(-1), respectively. An adverse effect of increasing solution ionic strength (NaNO3) on gold biosorption was observed. Gold-loaded biomass could be eluted with 0.1 mol dm(-3) NaOH with efficiencies higher than 90% at PPI 5.0 at the Solid-to-Liquid ratio, S/L, =4 (gdm(-3)). Cyanide mass balances for the adsorption, desorption as well as for the AVR process indicated the stability of the gold-cyanide which did not dissociate either upon acidification or upon binding by biomass functional groups. Gold biosorption mainly involved anionic AuCN2- species bound by ionizable biomass functional groups carrying a positive charge when protonated. FTIR analyses indicated that the main biomass functional groups involved in gold biosorption are most probably nitrogen-containing weak base groups. The present results confirmed that waste microbial biomaterials have some potential for removing and concentrating gold from solutions where it occurs as a gold-cyanide complex.

Intervention: Groups of simulated periarticular tibia fractures were stabilized with one of six different hybrid external fixator designs. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness of each specimen was measured in compression, torsion, flexion bending, extension bending, and varus/valgus bending. Results: Fixators with multiple levels of fixation in the peri articular fragment, regardless of design, were stiffer than those with one level. Specifically, the EBI Ring Connector fixator was stiffer than all others in all modes of testing. The Ace, Synthes, Smith & Nephew Richards, and Howmedica fixators were mechanically similar. The Zimmer Torus fixator was the least stiff fixator tested. Conclusions: Fixators with multiple levels of fixation in the periarticular fragment, regardless of design, were stiffer than those with one level. The: choice of which hybrid external fixator to use should be made based not only on stiffness but also on ease of clinical application, patient comfort, customer support from the manufacturer, and cost.

While this is a simple matter when working with free weights and machines, it becomes more difficult with plyometric training, especially in the case of the upper body. Weight training is often performed at intensities approaching 100%. Plyometric training must be performed at an intensity high enough to cause adaptation in the relevant biomaterials but not at intensities so great as to prolong amortization and to compromise the use of the serial elastic component and stretch reflex. Research recommendations exist for lower-body plyometrics, such as the depth jump, that suggest an optimal range of jump heights. Nonetheless, recommendations often do not consider the subject's body mass and impact force. Training loads for upper-body plyometrics performed with medicine balls have not been quantified. This study determines the vertical impact forces of the medicine ball (MB) for the purpose of quantifying training loads of MB drills with a vertical component. Based on results of the regression analysis, the following model was developed: vertical impact force [(height{cm} x 5.58) + (mass {kg} x 59.65)] - 468.30.

Methods: A prerequisite for guided tissue regeneration is the availability of materials with suitable physicochemical and bio-compatibility properties for the preparation of the devices. We investigated bone and peripheral nerve guided tissue regeneration, making two conduits from poly[L-lactide-co-6-caprolactone] (PLLC - peripheral nerve) and with poly [DL-lactide] (PDLLA - bone) with different features. After the polymer synthesis and chemical characterization, the conduits were evaluated in vivo in rat sciatic nerve gaps and in rabbit radius defects, Results: The results demonstrated good biocompatibility of both polymeric conduits, A good axonal regeneration and the restoration of the nerve trunk continuity, similar to that observed with autologous grafts has been obtained with PLLC conduits, that slowly degrade in about 6 months, PDLLA conduits protected the bone defect against the invasion of surrounding soft tissues; an effective bone growth bridging the defect was observed in their lumen. Conclusion: These results confirm the versatility of polylactides as biomaterials and will encourage further investigations on hard and soft tissues.","Rizzoli Orthopaed Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Chair Surg Pathophysiol, Bologna, Italy","Giardino, R (reprint author), Codivilla Putti IOR Res Inst, Dept Expt Surg, Via Barbiano 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",,"Fini, Milena/J-4808-2016","Fini, Milena/0000-0002-3732-3570; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969",,,,30,23,26,0,7,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1079-6061,,,J TRAUMA,J.

Bone is thereby formed without exogenous bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), well-characterized inducers of bone formation. Monolithic discs of sintered hydroxyapatite, fabricated with concavities of 800 and 1600 mu m diameter on both planar surfaces, were implanted in the rectus abdominis of the baboon (Papio ursinus). Histology on days 30 and 90 revealed de novo generation of bone exclusively within the concavities of the substratum. Porous hydroxyapatites were subsequently fabricated by impregnating polyurethane foams with slurry preparations of powdered hydroxyapatite, so that porous spaces formed by the coalescence of repetitive sequences of concavities. Artefacts were sintered in rod and disc configurations for implantation in heterotopic intramuscular sites and orthotopic calvarial sites, respectively. In four specimens, bone had formed in concavities of the substratum 30 days after implantation in the rectus abdominis. On day 90, bone morphogenesis with associated marrow had occurred in 33 specimens (41 %). Calvarial specimens showed substantial bone formation, culminating in complete penetration of bone within the porous spaces. On day 30, the immunolocalization of BMP family members (BMP-3 and OP-1/BMP-7) in cellular material at the hydroxyapatite interface suggests that the sintered ceramic may act as a solid-state matrix for adsorption of endogenously produced BMPs. These experiments demonstrate intrinsic osteoinductivity by monolythic and porous sintered hydroxyapatites implanted in heterotopic sites of adult primates, and that the geometry of the substratum profoundly regulates the expression of the osteogenic phenotype. The incorporation of specific biological activities into biomaterials achieved by manipulating the geometry of the substratum, defined as geometric induction of bone formation, will help engineer morphometric responses for therapeutic osteogenesis in clinical contexts.","Univ Witwatersrand, Bone Res Unit, MRC, Sch Med, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa; CSIR, Div Mat Sci & Technol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa","Ripamonti, U (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Bone Res Unit, MRC, Sch Med, 7 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.",177ripa@chiron.wits.ac.za,"Rohlf, F/A-8710-2008",,,,,56,114,128,0,11,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Using cell cultures the changes of cell functions induced by artificial materials may be evaluated. In screening rests the effect of biomaterials on functions common to all cell types is investigated through both continuous lines and primary cultures. In supplementary tests the effect of biomaterials on specific functions is studied, employing cells of the same type of those which will be in contact with the device in vivo. Osteoblasts, either From primary culture or an established line, are used to study the interaction with materials for bone implants. We evaluated whether dental cements affect the replication cycle of osteoblast-like cells MG63. The S phase was inhibited by the cements with a phenolic group, even though to a different extent. Mononuclear cell cultures are used to investigate the immune response, which is important in the host reaction to implant. We investigated whether the chromium ions released in a biological fluid may induce PBMC to produce cytokines involved in bone resorption. Chromium extract did not impair TNF alpha release significantly, but inhibited IL-6 release significantly in stimulated PBMC. Endothelial cell cultures are useful to the evaluation of materials for vascular grafts. We studied the influence of some types of Dacron on endothelial functions. Collagen-coated Dacron decreased significantly the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F-1 alpha.

Before the shape memory testing, it was necessary to determine the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the slightly crosslinked polyacrylamide as well as the mechanical properties of the composites at temperatures above T-g of a crosslinked polyacrylamide. Afterwards, the shape memory of the composite material was tested by performing a set of simple experiments based on deformation and heating of test pieces, their subsequent cooling and deformation force removing, and their repeated heating or water swelling, during which the residual elongation was measured and calculated. The composite material shaped in this way resumes its original shape if it is again heated above T-g of the crosslinked polyacrylamide or allowed to swell in distilled water. There exists a limiting concentration of hydrogel phase (approx. 30 phr), which is limited by good dispersion and good contact of hydrogel particles within the silicone matrix, under which the shape memory does not occur, and above which it exists.","Inst Chem Technol, Dept Polymers, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic","Hron, P (reprint author), Inst Chem Technol, Dept Polymers, Technicka 5, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,10,9,9,0,5,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0003-3146,,,ANGEW MAKROMOL CHEM,Angew.

It is comprised of a series of convection-diffusion-reaction equations which simulate platelet-surface and platelet-platelet adhesion, platelet activation by a weighted linear combination of agonist concentrations, agonist release and synthesis by activated platelets, platelet-phospholipid-dependent thrombin generation, and thrombin inhibition by heparin. The model requires estimation of four parameters to fit it to experimental data: shear-dependent platelet diffusivity and resting and activated platelet-surface and platelet-platelet reaction rate constants.

These parameters are estimated for platelet deposition onto a collagen substrate for simple parallel-plate how of whole blood in both the presence and absence of thrombin. One set of experimental results is used as a benchmark for model-fitting purposes. The ""trained"" model is then validated by applying it to additional test cases from the literature for parallel-plate Poiseuille flow over collagen at both higher and lower wall shear rates, and in the presence of various anticoagulants. The predicted values agree very well with the experimental results for the training cases, and good reproduction of deposition trends and magnitudes is obtained for the heparin, but not the citrate, validation cases.

Morphologic changes of cells that were contacted biomaterials or biomaterial extracts indicate their toxicity. However, information on cytotoxic effects is still obtained by subjective visual inspection of microscopic samples. In this article, a novel computer assisted method is introduced. The automatic analysis of digitized micrographs is achieved in several stages: segmentation, separation, classification, and measurement The segmentation of the image is provided by a new local adaptive thresholding technique, which adapts the threshold window sizes onto local gray level distribution and yields optimal window sizes. The actual threshold is obtained by maximizing interclass variances and minimizing intraclass variance. For the separation of connected cells, the binarized samples are cleaned from ""false"" markers by morphologic filtering. The subsequent separation is a two phase approach. Information levels are generated top-down by successively applying an enhanced erosion operator, which yields markers and filters noise usually evolving from multiple erosions. The converse bottom-up integration of the eroded markers is performed by successively applying an enhanced dilation operator, which reconstructs the cells and prevents merging of already separated objects. The subsequent measuring provides quantitative parameters of the distribution of size and compactness of the cells contained within the sample. The method was evaluated by L-929 fibroblasts that were in contact with 0%, 5%, and 10% concentrations of ethanol. For each concentration, 268 images of the cell populations were captured. The obtained quantitative parameters are highly correlated to the common verbal description of morphologic changes. Therefore, the proposed automatic method has several advantages compared with subjective examinations. The re suits allow an objective comparison of the quantification of phenomena; the subjective influence of the observer is eliminated; and the laboratory staff is relieved of time consuming routine work.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Med Informat, D-5100 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Physiol, D-5100 Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res Biomat, D-5100 Aachen, Germany","Metzler, V (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, TZL, Inst Signalverarbeitung & Proze, Seelandstr 1A, D-23569 Lubeck, Germany.",,,,,,,27,17,28,0,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-AUG,1999.0,45,4,,,,,264,271,,10.1097/00002480-199907000-00004,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,220RQ,WOS:000081681600004,10445730.0,,,,2019-02-25

The system was created as a research tool for evaluating cardiovascular function and for the design, testing, and evaluation of electrical-mechanical cardiovascular models and chronically implanted sensors. The system possesses a computerized user interface for controlling a linear displacement pulsatile pump in a controlled flow loop format to emulate in vivo cardiovascular characteristics. Evaluation of the pump system consisted of comparing its aortic pressure and flow profiles with in vivo rhesus hemodynamic waveforms in the time and frequency domains. Comparison of aortic pressure and flow data between the pump system and in vivo data showed good agreement in the time and frequency domains, however, the pump system produced a larger pulse pressure. The pump system can be used for comparing cardiovascular parameters with predicted cardiovascular model values and for evaluating such items as vascular grafts, heart valves, biomaterials, and sensors. This article describes the development and evaluation of this feedback controlled cardiovascular dynamics simulation modeling system.","Univ Louisville, Dept Surg, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Louisville, KY 40202 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Elect Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Aerosp Med Directorate, Div Clin Sci, Brooks AFB, TX USA; N Dakota State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; Trinity Univ, Dept Engn, San Antonio, TX USA","Koenig, SC (reprint author), Univ Louisville, Dept Surg, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, 500 S Floyd St,Room 118, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",,,,,,,16,4,4,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1058-2916,,,ASAIO J,Asaio J.,JUL-AUG,1999.0,45,4,,,,,334,338,,10.1097/00002480-199907000-00015,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Transplantation",Engineering; Transplantation,220RQ,WOS:000081681600015,10445741.0,,,,2019-02-25

The new lipids were shown to be at least equivalent to MePEGA-2000-DSPE in assays designed to evaluate the effectiveness of polymers as steric barrier molecules in liposomes. Liposomes containing 1-5% of ATTA8-DSPE (octamer) showed comparable long circulation behavior relative to PEG-2000-DSPE analogues. Surprisingly, the shorter ATTA4-DSPE (tetramer) appeared to be quite effective in reducing clearance. Liver enzyme levels and systemic single dose tolerability of ATTA8-DSPE liposomes were comparable to controls, suggesting that the new materials are nontoxic. Prolonged exposure of ATTA8-DSPE liposomes to splenocytes in vitro showed no evidence of mitogenicity relative to controls or MePEGA-2000-DSPE liposomes. ATTA8-DSPE was as effective as MePEGC-2000-DSPE in preventing complement activation by cationic liposome systems. Repeat dosage in vivo regimes in ICR mice using DSPC/cholesterol liposomes, with and without 5% ATTA8-DSPE and MePEGC-2000-DSPE, showed no evidence of enhanced clearance on successive doses. Splenocytes recovered after repeat doses showed no significant evidence of mitogenicity on restimulation with liposomes. Cellular differentiation and activation marker levels in splenocytes recovered after the fourth in vivo administration were at normal levels. These results suggest that ATTAn oligomers do not induce an immune response in isolation. It was demonstrated that ATTA8-DSPE could be used to replace PEG-lipids in the formulation of doxorubicin, plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides using a variety of formulation techniques. The study demonstrates that ATTAn oligomers can be safely and effectively used in place of poly(ethylene glycol) as well-defined biomaterials in liposomal applications where reproducible behavior is critical.","Inex Pharmaceut Corp, Burnaby, BC V5J 5J8, Canada","Ansell, SM (reprint author), Inex Pharmaceut Corp, 100-8900 Glenlyon Pkwy, Burnaby, BC V5J 5J8, Canada.",,"Hankins, Jane/N-3362-2018",,,,,37,8,9,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1043-1802,,,BIOCONJUGATE CHEM,Bioconjugate Chem.,JUL-AUG,1999.0,10,4,,,,,653,666,,10.1021/bc990005p,,,,14,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Organic",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,219QC,WOS:000081617100015,10411464.0,,,,2019-02-25

Cells were cultured in the presence of Laddec(R) (a highly purified bovine xenograft) and Bio-Oss(R) (natural bone mineral). Optical microscopic observations showed that osteoblasts attached on the plastic culture dishes and formed close contact with biomaterial particles. By day 5, the osteoblasts formed a confluent monolayer. A cytozymatic method showed intense alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining around and between the substrate granules of the two materials. By day 14, inverted phase microscopic observations showed that osteoblasts formed bone nodules around and between substrate particles, In addition, at this time, the Von Kossa staining was positive. Using a conventional assay, ALP specific activity was higher in the presence of Laddec(R) than in the presence of Bio-Oss(R). A quantitative morphological method using image analysis showed that the proportion of mineralized bone formed around biomaterial particles in relation to total bone was increased with Laddec(R) (15% more than with Bio-Oss(R)). Ultrastructural observations by TEM showed the presence of an electron dense collagen-free layer at the biomaterial/bone interface and a collagenous matrix deposited at the periphery, indicating the bioactivity of the biomaterials. These results indicated that Laddec(R) increased the expression of ALP in osteoblast cultures and facilitated the formation of multiple cell layers, providing a culture environment suitable for mineralization.

The protein pattern of the conditioning film of implanted nonencrusted and encrusted urological stents was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot of the desorbed species. The results obtained highlighted different electrophoresis profiles between nonencrusted and encrusted stents. Western blot showed the ubiquitous presence of albumin, while Tamm-Horsfall Protein and al-microglobulin adsorption was limited to nonencrusted devices. By an in vitro dynamic model in which, artificial urine was flowed through the lumen of control and retrieved nonencrusted stents, we demonstrated that the organic layer remarkably enhanced crystal precipitation and aggregation events on the surface.

Infections constitute one serious complication which may lead to the removal of the implant. In contrast to infections around polymer implants, infections around skin-penetrating titanium implants anchored in the temporal bone are often cured by local treatment. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common etiological agents in infections related to polymers whereas Staphylococcus aureus is considered as the main pathogen in infections around metallic implants, Microbial adhesion is a prerequisite for an infection. In the present study, the cell surface of microbes isolated from the skin around skin-penetrating titanium implants, with and without signs of infection, was characterized with respect to expression of cell surface hydrophobicity and to binding of immobilized fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen type 1 which could mediate adhesion. Expression of protein binding was similar in strains isolated from the two groups. No strain expressed a hydrophobic cell surface as determined by two-phase separation, and we conclude that the microenvironment around a titanium implant promotes expression of a hydrophilic rather than a hydrophobic cell surface which in turn makes many infections around a titanium implant curable by local treatment.

Each type of microcapsules has a membrane of different composition. Using three kinds of monomers, N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), 4-(aminomethyl)styrene (AmSt), and N,N-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide (DMAPAA), one type of aqueous copolymer having primary and tertiary amino groups was obtained. By the polymerization of three kinds of monomers, DMAAm, AmSt, and 2-[(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium-chloride (METAC), another type of aqueous copolymer having primary and quaternary ammonium groups was also obtained. Two more types of copolymers were synthesized by copolymerization of alpha-acryloxy-omega-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (a-PEG) with the above two kinds of monomer mixture. These copolymers were polymerized with terephthaloyldichloride at the water/oil interface to prepare Pour types of microcapsules containing water, i.e., poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAA-co-AmSt-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAA-co-AmSt-co -PEG-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, poly (DMAAm-co-METAC-co-AmSt-alt-terephthalic acid) microcapsules, and poly (DMAAm-co-METAC-co-AmSt-co-PEC-alt-tefephthalic acid) microcapsules, which will be abbreviated to MC 1, MC 2, MC 3, and MC 4, respectively. It has been predicted that the microcapsule membranes are hydrophilic and soft and have two-sublayer structures from electrophoretic mobility measurements and from the analysis of the data with Ohshima's electrokinetic theory for soft particles. The outer sublayers of MC 1 and MC 2 are negatively charged and those of MC 3 and 4 are slightly positively charged. Also, the surfaces of MC 1 and MC 2 are harder than those of MC 3 and 4. By PEGylation, the surface charge density in the membranes decreases and the surface becomes softer. It has been found that the membrane of red blood cells (RBC) is also soft and is composed of two-sublayers, the outer sublayer of which is negatively charged and the inner one is positively charged. The interaction of four types of microcapsules with RBC has been studied. It was found that microcapsules with soft surfaces (MC 3 and MC 4) do not interact with RBC, even though the microcapsule surfaces are positively charged and the surface of RBC is negatively charged. On the other hand, microcapsules with negatively charged but harder surfaces (MC 1) interact with RBC to introduce hemolysis. The membrane surface of MC 2, which is obtained by PEGylation of MC 1, becomes softer than that of MC 1 so that the interaction with RBC was weakly suppressed. From these, it was concluded that the dominant factor to control the interaction between synthetic polymer surfaces and biological cell surfaces is not the surface charges carried by the polymer surfaces but the softness of the polymer surfaces.

In this study, we present a detailed morphological and functional characterization of covalently side-bound dextran layers by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS). The surface chemistry was monitored step-by-step by ellipsometric characterization of the surface loading. Dextrans of various molecular masses (10-2000 kD) were immobilized leading to surface loadings between 3 and mm(-2). The refractive indices of the covalently attached dextran layers under atmospheric conditions (n(D) = 1.51) ng mm were very close to the refractive index of a spin-coated dextran layer (n(D) = 1.52) indicating dense and homogeneous coverage achieved by the coupling chemistry. Under buffer solution, refractive indices between 1.34 and 1.365 and thicknesses between 20 and 40 nm of these dextran layers were determined. A dextran concentration in the hydrated layers of 0.05-0.21 g cm(-3) was estimated from the refractive index. The density and the thickness of the hydrated layers increased with molecular mass of the dextran. Non-specific binding was strongly reduced by the dextran layers and decreased with increasing thickness and density of the layer. Specific antibody binding to haptens immobilized in the dextran layer lead to an increase of both the density and the thickness of the layers. Time resolved detection by RIfS indicated significant decrease of protein mobility in the dextran layer. From these results we conclude that the functional properties of dextran layers with respect to protein interactions are determined by their effective pore-size, which is controlled by the number of bonds, the surface loading and the concentration of charged groups in the polymer.

The advantages of method D are no residue, no redox reaction, insignificant loss of analytes and enhanced sensitivity (at ppb level vs ppm of the other methods).

The polypropylene group showed higher cell density and polymorphonuclear response in the initial phases, while scores for giant cells were higher in the mersilene group. Fibrohistiocytic reaction was increased in the polypropylene group. Polypropylene tends to provoke higher acute inflammatory reaction and connective tissue formation than mersilene. The latter induces higher foreign body reaction.","Hosp Clin Univ San Carlos, Serv Cirugia Gen & Digest 1, Dept Gen & Digest Surg 1, Madrid 28040, Spain","Ortiz-Oshiro, E (reprint author), Hosp Clin Univ San Carlos, Serv Cirugia Gen & Digest 1, Dept Gen & Digest Surg 1, C-O Prof Martin Lagso S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",,"International Surgery, ICS/D-3993-2011","Mayol, Julio/0000-0003-2411-6668",,,,26,6,6,0,0,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0020-8868,,,INT SURG,Int.

Despite the large number of experimental studies, there is a lack of fundamental information on SIS anisotropic mechanical behavior and how this behavior changes postimplantation. As a first step in our study of remodeling biomaterials, we performed biaxial mechanical testing to quantify the anisotropic mechanical behavior and used small-angle Light scattering (SALS) to quantify the gross fiber structure of fresh, unimplanted SIS. Structural results indicate that SIS displays primarily a single, continuous preferred fiber direction oriented parallel to the long axis of the intestine. Occasionally, two distinct fiber populations oriented at similar to+/-280 with respect to the longitudinal axis could be distinguished. Consistent with this structure, SIS exhibited a nonlinear, anisotropic mechanical response with higher stresses along the longitudinal axis. Further, the circumferential stress-strain response was strongly affected by the maximum longitudinal strain level, but the maximum circumferential strain level only weakly affected the longitudinal stress-strain response. This asymmetric mechanical coupling suggests strong mechanical interactions on a fiber level. SIS stress-strain response also was similar to glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium, attesting to the substantial strength of SIS in the fresh, untreated state. The results of this study will provide a basis for a future analysis of the structural and mechanical changes during the remodeling process.

These materials have application as injectable cardiovascular implants;cytotoxicity due to leachable products, as well as inflammation caused by the biomaterial itself, may ultimately affect the biocompatibility of the implant. We utilized a 7-day in vitro cytotoxicity assay to quantify cell density and cellular proliferation in the presence of copolymer films. The copolymer films exhibited slight to moderate cytotoxicity toward cultured endothelial cells, showing 20-86% viability relative to controls. Cell viability increased with an increasing weight percent of PEG or, to a lesser extent, the molecular weight of PEG. In vivo biocompatibility was assessed using a cage implantation model over a 21-day time period. This system was used to characterize the local cellular and humoral inflammatory response in the surrounding exudate, as well as the size and density of macrophages adherent to the material itself. All copolymer formulations exhibited excellent biocompatibility relative to controls with no significant differences in total leukocyte count among the different formulations. The in vivo inflammatory reaction displayed normal wound healing over 21 days as shown by a progressive decrease in both leukocyte concentration and enzymatic activity. The surface coverage of the copolymer films remained relatively constant from 7 to 21 days; There were no cells larger than 0.003 mm(2),which was previously shown to be the threshold value for foreign-body giant cells.,These data suggest that P(PF-co-EG) hydrogels have potential for use as injectable biomaterials.

They are now accepted as a prime component of signal transduction. Because focal adhesions also play an important role in cell morphology and migration, it can be argued that their presence is indicative of healthy cells. This has been the reason for several research groups to conclude that biomaterials sustaining focal adhesion assembly are biocompatible. In this study we demonstrate that cells under cytotoxic stress may still be able to retain their focal adhesions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells at passage 2 were exposed to nickel and zinc ion solutions ranging from 1 to 0.01 mM for 4 and 24 h. Cells were seeded on fibronectin precoated glass slides or in tissue culture quality 96-well plates. MTT conversion with 1 and 0.5 mM nickel and zinc was strongly depressed, indicating that these concentrations are cytotoxic. Proliferative activity was also affected by these concentrations. Cells exposed to zinc typically retracted and detached from the surface, whereas cells exposed to nickel remained on the surface without signs of retraction. Nevertheless, cells exposed to nickel were impaired to reach con fluency, which was determined by cadherin-5 expression. All these data indicate that nickel ions at a sufficient concentration influence cells in a cytotoxic way. Despite this apparent cytotoxicity, focal adhesion distribution as visualized by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin was not affected. With zinc the morphological changes were accompanied by apparent fusion of focal adhesions during retraction and finally dissolution. These data indicate that the mere presence of focal adhesions does not allow a reliable statement about the functional status of a fell. On the other hand, when focal adhesions are affected it is an excellent monitor of disturbed cell function.

This is the first report on the observation of platelets adhered to opaque biomaterials in real time under shear flow conditions. The direct observation of platelet adhesion to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) as an opaque biomaterial revealed that the kinetics of platelet adhesion to ePTFE depended greatly on shear stresses, showing that the shear stress of 5.0 dyne/cm(2) induced higher adhesiveness of platelets to ePTFE than that of either 0.1 or 15 dyne/cm(2). The observation also showed a difference in platelet adhesiveness among ePTFEs with different fibril lengths-0, 3.2, 18, and 35 mu m-indicating that ePTFEs with shorter fibril length had lower adhesiveness of platelets under a shear stress of 5.0 dyne/cm(2). It is indispensable for analyzing the phenomena of platelet adhesion to opaque biomaterials to observe in real-time rolling, adhesion, and detachment of platelets under shear stresses without disturbing shear flow conditions. The results showed that the mechanical and optical design of the system could serve this purpose.

These substitutes lack the osteogenic and osteoinductive properties of bone autograft, A direct approach would be to stimulate osteogenesis in these biomaterials by the addition of fresh bone-marrow cells (BMC). We therefore created osteoperiosteal gaps 2 cm wide in the ulna of adult rabbits and either bridged them with coral alone (CC), coral supplemented with BMC, or left them empty, Coral was chosen as a scaffold because of its good biocompatibility and resorbability, In osteoperiosteal gaps bridged with coral only, the coral was invaded chiefly by fibrous tissue. It was insufficient to produce union after two months. In defects filled with coral and BMC an increase in osteogenesis was observed and the bone surface area was significantly higher compared with defects filled with coral alone. Bony union occurred in six out of six defects filled with coral and BMC after two months. An increase in the resorption of coral was also observed, suggesting that resorbing cells or their progenitors were present in bone marrow and survived the grafting procedure. Our findings have shown that supplementation of coral with BMC increased both the resorption of material and osteogenesis in defects of a clinical significance.","Univ D Diderot, Lab Rech Orthoped, UPRES A 7052, CNRS, F-75010 Paris, France","Petite, H (reprint author), Univ D Diderot, Lab Rech Orthoped, UPRES A 7052, CNRS, 10 Ave Verdun, F-75010 Paris, France.",,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060",,,,29,39,43,2,3,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND WC2N 6ET",0301-620X,,,J BONE JOINT SURG BR,J.

We constructed a closed loop in vitro heparinized whole human blood circulation model for testing hemocompatibility of coronary stents, This model allows evaluation of human blood activation by blood-stent interaction in a well-controlled setting, Until now these interactions were studied in the highly coagulable pig coronary artery model. Methods: We evaluated activation of the coagulation system and blood components by uncoated, heparin-coated, and silicon-carbide coated tantalum stents, The effects, measured by biochemical assays, were compared with stainless-steel stents, Also the inhibitory effect on platelet activation by indomethacin equal to the oral effect of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily, was measured and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Both activation of the coagulation system and platelets were counteracted by indomethacin, suggesting an important role for platelets in activation of the coagulation system in this model. Despite platelet activation by all stents, the SiC-coated tantalum stent demonstrates a significantly lower GpIIIa receptor-mediated platelet adhesion at the stent surface (21.7 X 10(3) counts per second/mg stent weight) compared to all other stents (stainless-steel 54.0, heparin-coated 95.7 and uncoated 76.2 X 10(3) cps/mg). Also activated leukocytes demonstrated a significantly loner CD11b receptor-mediated adhesion at the SiC-coated stent (37.0 X 10(3) cps/mg) than at the stainless-steel stent (114.5 X 10(3) cps/mg).

Only ultra-high surface area HAp powder, prepared by the metathesis method (10Ca(NO3)(2) + 6(NH4)(2)HPO4 + 8NH(4)OH), could produce dense coatings when sintered at 875-1000 degrees C. Single EPD coatings cracked during sintering owing to the 15-18% sintering shrinkage, but the HAp did not decompose. The use of dual coatings (coat, sinter, coat, sinter) resolved the cracking problem. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) inspection revealed that the second coating filled in the ""valleys"" in the cracks of the first coating. The interfacial shear strength of the dual coatings was found, by ASTM F1044-87, to be similar to 12 MPa on a titanium substrate and similar to 22 MPa on 316L stainless steel, comparing quite favorably with the 34 MPa benchmark (the shear strength of bovine cortical bone was found to be 34 MPa).

We investigated the possibility of using a modified cellulosic membrane for continuous therapies, assessing the hydraulic characteristics and clearance performances of high-flux cellulose triacetate hemodiafilter (0.7 m(2)) in vitro and in vivo. The flowdynamic characteristics of the filter suggest its optimal use in veno-venous pump-drive techniques. Efficiency was excellent, with urea daily clearances as high as 50 liters or more. The high permeability and porosity of the membrane also increased the clearances of larger solutes such as creatinine and inulin.

Many studies have show that various growth factors enhance wound healing in animal models. However, growth factors are expensive and complex and their wound pharmacokinetics are unknown. The cinical trials with growth factors in the treatment of chronic wounds have produced unsuccessful results. A viable alternative to growth factors may be certain biomaterials such as hydrophilic, carbohydrate beads. Materials and Methods. Positively charged, negatively charged, or uncharged beads were applied to paired 6-cm rat incisions. The following key aspects of the wound healing process were examined: wound breaking strength and histological analysis. Results. Our data show that wounds treated with positively charged, DEAE Sephadez beads had a 46-50% (P < 0.001) increase in breaking strength over untreated control wounds. A variety of other positively charged, anion exchange materials also elicited a wound healing response, despite the fact that the positively charged chemical moieties as well as the bead matrix were different, hi conjunction with the increase in wound breaking strength, an increase in wound macrophage was observed in wounds treated with anion exchangers (P < 0.01). Negatively charged or uncharged beads showed no significant difference from the untreated controls. Conclusion. We conclude from this study that the enhancement of wound healing seen with positively charged beads is due principally to the positive charge on the beads; we postulate that the anion exchange between the positively charged beads and tissue is responsible for this enhancement.

Looking at the bio-joint mechanism, the solid-fluid composite structure of the cancellous bone is likely to play a great important role in the load transmission. So, the solid-fluid composite model equal to the cancellous bone was made by using honeycomb structure. Static indentation testing was carried out, and in-plane deformation conditions of the solid-fluid composite specimens were measured quantitatively. Experimental results illustrated that the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid phase greatly influenced on the in-plane deformation condition of the solid phase. Consequently, as for the solid-fluid composite models, the compressive load dispersion by the solid-fluid phase interaction was expected.","Doshisha Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 6100321, Japan; Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd, Hydraul Excavator Dev Ctr, Akashi, Hyogo 6748686, Japan","Katayama, T (reprint author), Doshisha Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 6100321, Japan.",,,,,,,15,3,3,0,1,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"SHINANOMACHI-RENGAKAN BLDG, SHINANOMACHI 35, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 160, JAPAN",1340-8046,,,JSME INT J A-SOLID M,JSME Int.

Methods: Viscoelastic shear properties of various implantable biomaterials (Teflon, gelatin, collagen, fat, hyaluronic acid, and hyaluronic acid with fibronectin) were measured with a parallel-plate rotational rheometer, Elastic and viscous shear properties were quantified as a function of oscillation frequency (0.01-15 Hz) at 37 degrees C. Results: The shear properties of hyaluronic acid were relatively close to those of human vocal fold mucosal tissues reported previously. Hyaluronic acid at specific concentrations (0.5%-1%), with or without fibronectin, was found to exhibit viscous shear properties (viscous shear modulus and dynamic viscosity) similar to those of the average male and female vocal fold mucosa. Conclusions: According to a theory that establishes the effects of tissue shear properties on, vocal fold oscillation, phonation threshold pressure (a measure of the ease of phonation) is directly related to the viscous shear modulus of the vibrating vocal fold mucosa. Therefore, our findings suggest that hyaluronic acid, either by itself or mixed with fibronectin, may be a potentially optimal bioimplant for the surgical management of vocal fold mucosal defects and lamina propria deficiencies (e.g., scarring) from a biomechanical standpoint.","Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Denver Ctr Performing Arts, Wilbur James Gould Voice Res Ctr, Denver, CO USA","Chan, RW (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, 330 WJSHC, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",roger-chan@uiowa.edu,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [P60 DC00976],,,39,82,85,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-852X,1531-4995,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,JUL,1999.0,109,7,1,,,,1142,1149,,10.1097/00005537-199907000-00026,,,,8,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,212YC,WOS:000081244400026,10401858.0,,,,2019-02-25

Various biomaterials are used for reconstruction of the anophthalmic orbit, often with unsatisfactory long-term results. Implants have been placed between the periorbital and the orbital floor. The authors describe a new material composed of hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP) in the form of ceramic blocks, to be placed into the orbital fat as a new surgical site. Methods: Ten patients with PESS underwent surgery to compensate the volume deficit of the anophthalmic orbit. Blocks of HA-TCP were created by fragmentation of a larger piece, tailored as needed, and implanted in the orbital fat. The patients were monitored regularly with clinical and radiologic examinations to evaluate the behavior of the implants. Results: The volume of the HA-TCP was measured in 5 cases (mean, 2.95 +/- 1.08 ml). A significant reduction of enophthalmos was obtained: mean Hertel exophthalmometry measured 12.7 +/- 2.5 mm preoperatively and 14 +/- 2.4 mm postoperatively (P < 0.05). The average prosthesis volume was significantly reduced in the cases measured: 2.7 ml +/- 0.94 ml preoperatively and 1.8 +/- 0.7 ml postoperatively (p < 0.02). There was a negative correlation between the HA-TCP implant volume and postoperative prosthesis volume (correlation coefficient = -0.925; p < 0.05). According to photographic evaluation, correction of the enophthalmos and of the superior sulcus depression were obtained in 70% and 90% of cases, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging seems to demonstrate that the blocks become well integrated into the surrounding orbital tissue. Conclusion: The HA-TCP blocks correct some anomalies of PESS. Placement of the blocks directly into the orbital fat is a promising alternative to the traditional subperiosteal location.","Ctr Hosp Univ Dupuytren, Dept Ophthalmol, Limoges, France","Adenis, JP (reprint author), CHRU Dupuytren, Serv Ophtalmol, 2 Ave Martin Luther King, F-87042 Limoges, France.",,"ROBERT, Pierre-Yves/O-8597-2016",,,,,26,14,16,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0740-9303,,,OPHTHALMIC PLAST REC,Ophthalmic Plast.

The mechanism for this is unknown. During the initial phase of bone implantation the biomaterial comes into direct contact with whole blood. In this study we use a newly developed in vitro chamber model to compare different commonly used biomaterials in contact with whole blood. These materials were selected with respect to their different osteointegrating properties in order to correlate these properties with the response to whole blood. In the presence of 3 IU/ml of heparin only titanium induced macroscopic clotting. This was reflected by the generation of thrombin-antithrombin which was much increased in blood in contact with titanium compared with steel and PVC. The coagulation activation caused by titanium was triggered by the intrinsic pathway because the generation of FXIIa-AT/C1 esterase inhibitor paralleled that of thrombin-antithrombin, and both thrombin-antithrombin complex and FXIIa-AT/C1 esterase inhibitor generation were abrogated by corn trypsin inhibitor, which is a specific inhibitor of FXIIa. The binding of platelets was increased on the titanium surface compared to the other biomaterial surfaces and the state of platelet activation was much more pronounced as reflected by the levels of beta-thromboglobulin and PDGF. This study indicates that titanium is unsuitable as a biomaterial in devices which are in direct contact with blood for a prolonged period. Furthermore, PDGF and other alpha-granule proteins e. g. TGF-beta, are known to be potent promoters of osteogenesis which suggests that the pronounced thrombogenic properties of titanium might contribute to the good osteointegrating properties.","Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Mat Sci, Angstrom Lab, Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Kalmar, Dept Nat Sci, Kalmar, Sweden","Nilsson, B (reprint author), Univ Uppsala Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012; Andersson, Joakim/A-3017-2009; Nilsson Ekdahl, Kristina/B-5301-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730; Andersson, Joakim/0000-0003-2991-1927; ",,,,42,129,132,0,6,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-6245,2567-689X,,THROMB HAEMOSTASIS,Thromb.

These changes have been shown to be dependent on the biomaterials, techniques, and devices used. In this study the influence of a new cell separator (AMICUS) and storage container (PL-2410) on platelet glycoproteins was analyzed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During plateletpheresis and storage, the levels of platelet glycoproteins and binding of fibrinogen were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: During apheresis, mean channel fluorescence intensity of GD41a did not change significantly (p = 0.06). A small increase was evident in CD42b mean channel fluorescence intensity, which rose from a baseline level of 178.6 +/- 68.3 to 231.5 +/- 97.9 at the end of the procedure (p<0.05); in CD62p-positive platelets, which increased from 2.0 +/- 0.9 percent to 9.9 +/- 3.9 percent (p<0.05); in CD63-positive platelets, which increased from 1.7 +/- 0.7 percent to 7.9 +/- 2.6 percent (p<0.05); and in the binding of fibrinogen, which increased from 1.9 +/- 0.8 percent positive platelets to 10.5 +/- 2.6 percent (p<0.05). During storage, the mean channel fluorescence intensity of CD41a and C-D42b, the percentage of CD62p- and GD63-positive platelets, and the binding of fibrinogen to platelets showed no significant change. CONCLUSION: These studies show that alterations in platelet antigens and platelet activation occur to a small degree during apheresis and storage. These findings demonstrate generally good biocompatibility of this new cell separator.","Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Transfus Med Transplantat Immunol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Hemostaseol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; Baxter Res & Dev Europe, Nivelles, Belgium","Gutensohn, K (reprint author), Univ Hamburg, Hosp Eppendorf, Dept Transfus Med Transplantat Immunol, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,45,6,7,0,1,AMER ASSOC BLOOD BANKS,BETHESDA,"8101 GLENBROOK RD, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2749 USA",0041-1132,,,TRANSFUSION,Transfusion,JUL,1999.0,39,7,,,,,742,747,,10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39070742.x,,,,6,Hematology,Hematology,216EK,WOS:000081428100012,10413282.0,,,,2019-02-25

These structures are primarily adapted to the variety of mechanical functions that bone fulfills. Here we review the structure-mechanical relations of one bone structural type, lamellar bone. This is the most abundant type in many mammals, including humans. A lamellar unit is composed of five sublayers. Each sublayer is an array of aligned mineralized collagen fibrils. The orientations of these arrays differ in each sublayer with respect to both collagen fibril axes and crystal layers, such that a complex rotated plywood-like structure is formed. Specific functions for lamellar bone, as opposed to the other bone types, could not be identified. It is therefore proposed that the lamellar structure is multifunctional-the ""concrete"" of the bone family of materials. Experimentally measured mechanical properties of lamellar bone demonstrate a clear-cut anisotropy with respect to the axis direction of long bones. A comparison of the elastic and ultimate properties of parallel arrays of lamellar units formed in primary bone with cylindrically shaped osteonal structures in secondary formed bone shows that most of the intrinsic mechanical properties are built into the lamellar structure. The major advantages of osteonal bone are its fracture properties. Mathematical modeling of the elastic properties based on the lamellar structure and using a rule-of-mixtures approach can closely simulate the measured mechanical properties, providing greater insight into the structure-mechanical relations of lamellar bone. a 1999 Academic Press.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mat & Interfaces, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Weiner, S (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",,,,NIDCR NIH HHS [DEO6954],,,56,379,392,3,136,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1047-8477,,,J STRUCT BIOL,J.

Peptide bond cleavage of the modified inteins generated an N-terminal cysteine and a C-terminal thioester on the same protein, These complementary reactive groups underwent intra- or intermolecular condensation to generate circular or polymeric protein species with a new peptide bond at the site of ligation, Three cyclic peptides, BBP, an organ specific localization peptide; RGD, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation; and CDR-H3/C2, which inhibits HIV-1 replication, were isolated using the two-intein system.

Our study is aimed at developing technology designed to alter the outer atomic layers of a material to give the desired compatibility with the tissue while retaining the properties of the bulk substratum. Materials used in this study were titanium vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) and cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy (Co-Cr). Soda Lime glass discs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) acted as controls. A cathode of either Ti-6Al-4V or Co-Cr was used to simultaneously deposit and implant identified substrata. The attachment of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) to various materials was determined using radiolabeling or colorimetric assays. Results show that HBDC adhere preferentially to the unmodified surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-4V on glass compared to the unmodified Co-Cr surfaces and to that of the Co-Cr on glass. Depositing Ti-6Al-4V on Co-Cr gives significantly better attachment of HBDC than when depositing Co-Cr onto Ti-6Al-4V. While cellular attachment to the created surfaces reflects that of the cathodic materials, it is not identical to these materials. Ion deposition/implantation is capable of creating permanent surfaces which reflect the adhesion of source materials not bulk substrata.

Histiocytes were markedly accumulated around the particles of UHMWPE (11 mu m), Co-Cr (3.9 mu m), SUS316L (3.9 mu m), Co-Cr (0.03 mu m), and titanium alloy (0.03 mu m). Around the UHMWPE particles (99 mu m), a slight histiocytic reaction and bone formation were observed. Particles of alumina ceramics (3.9 mu m) and titanium alloy (3.5 mu m) which were in phagocytosable sizes also had few histiocytic reactions. Statistically, the material difference was more strongly related to the histiocyte reaction than to the particle size and calculated total surface area of particles.

The toxicity of forms of the individual elements released from ASTM F75 Co-Cr-Mo (Co-Cr-Mo), F138 316L stainless steel (316L), and F136 Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-6Al-4V) was first determined, and a mathematical model was developed to predict the toxicity of mixtures of these ions. Aqueous metal solutions were then mixed according to the proportions of the ions found in these alloys, and their toxicity was measured with Microtox. Mixture behavior was classified as synergistic, antagonistic, or additive by comparing measured toxicity to predicted toxicity. Since relating these tests to actual implant corrosion processes can be con founded by selective leaching, the predicted and measured toxicity of aqueous metal solutions mixed according to proportions representative of selective leaching were next determined, and the mixture behaviors were classified as before. The most toxic individual alloying elements were found to be hexavalent Cr, Ni, and Co, in that order: a finding in accord with prior biocompatibility research. Co-Cr-Mo was found to be the most toxic alloy mixture of both those combined according to alloy composition and those combined to reflect selective leaching. The Ti-6Al-4V mixtures were found to behave synergistically, while the Co-Cr-Mo and 316L mixtures behaved antagonistically. By providing insight into degradation product toxicity and elemental interaction, these experiments demonstrate the utility of employing bioluminescent bacterial assays to investigate biocompatibility of implant materials. Further studies to more closely simulate in vivo conditions, though, are required to fully gauge their potential in this regard.

The difference of the binding behavior of protein with that of the immobilized metal ions is also discussed. For the immobilized Fe(III), ITC results show that the adsorption enthalpy at a constant pH value decreased as the NaCl concentration increased and also decreased with the pH values at constant NaCl concentrations. The adsorption enthalpy become negative under higher pH values or higher salt concentrations indicating the adsorption process is partly driven by the enthalpy. The enthalpy of lysozyme with Fe(III) is higher than that with Cu(II) implying that the heat required for the dehydration of Cu(II) is lower than for the dehydration of Fe(III) and/or that the heat generated from the formation of the coordination with Cu(II) is higher than with Fe(III). In addition, the comparison of different immobilized metal ions corresponding to the equilibrium binding affinity suggests that the binding force of lysozyme with Cu(II) is higher than with Fe(III). This study presents the chemical differences between the binding affinity and the adsorption enthalpy of lysozyme interacting with the immobilized metal ions. The binding and thermodynamic data presented in this study elucidate the mechanism and process of lysozyme binding with immobilized metal ions. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristic functions provide valuable information enabling a more thorough understanding of protein adsorption at the immobilized metal ion affinity surface.

Resorption of the ceramic coatings has raised some concern about the behavior of the bone-implant interfaces after the coating disappearance. Substitution of the OH- ions by fluoride in the hydroxylapatite (HA) lattice makes the calcium phosphate more stable. We investigated the degradation rate of dental implants with 50- and 100-mu m coatings of HA, fluorapatite (FA), or fluorhydroxylapatite (FHA), The implants were inserted in dog jaws and retrieved for histological analysis after 3, 6, and 12 months. The thickness of the calcium phosphate coatings was evaluated using an image analysis device. A relative resorption index and its standard deviation were studied. HA and FA coatings (even at 100-mu m thickness) were almost totally degraded within the implantation period. In contrast, the FHA coatings did not show significant degradation during the same period. The standard deviation showed that the resorption process for FHA with thicknesses of 50 or 100 mu m was the same, Such a difference was not observed between the 50- and 100-mu m thick coatings of FA and HA.

The most toxic materials appeared to be the M-GIC Hi-Dense and the RM-GIC Vitremer, The less toxic ones appeared to be the RM-GICs Compoglass and Photac-Fil, Attempts made to identify the factors responsible for their cytotoxicity indicated that in vitro cytotoxicity did not seem to be caused by any change in pH of the biomaterial eluates. Adsorption of biomaterial eluates on dentin powder significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of all biomaterials. The concentration of F-, Sr2+, and Al3+ (major ionic elements present in GICs) in the eluate of six glass ionomer containing biomaterials was too low to be cytotoxic, However, Cu2+ and Ag+ (present in alloys of M-GIC) were present in toxic concentrations in Hi-Dense eluates, Unpolymerized monomers leached from resins were identified by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy in biomaterial eluates, The monomers hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), and poly(acrylic) acid were identified in eluates of Vitremer, Compoglass, and Hi-Dense, respectively, After ethanol elution of HEMA and TEGDMA from Vitremer and Compoglass, respectively, the cytotoxicity of these two RM-GICs was drastically reduced.

They were implanted as femoral transverse diaphyseal pins that were 1.5 mm in diameter. At 5 and 45 weeks, implant and bone histologic specimens were evaluated histologically and by a scanning electron microscope and an electron microprobe, Also, regional lymph nodes and spleens were examined. By 45 weeks, direct implant-bone contact was observed over most of the interface in most specimens, At the implant surface, there was partial replacement of CFRC with host tissue. However, the microprobe showed that the implant-bone interface was chemically abrupt with no cross-diffusion of ionic species. Besides the surface effects, there was partial filling of the implant pores with tissue, including bone organized de novo deep within, This was observed histologically and confirmed by microprobe. Lymph nodes and spleens were histologically normal, and no carbon particles were found. None of the results were influenced by porosity or matrix crystallite size over the ranges studied. In summary, these porous CFRCs are partially degraded when in contact with bone and appear substantially tissue compatible. They may be useful as scaffolds for regrowth of bone.

The swelling behavior of the hydrogels in water, alkaline, and acidic media showed a slight decrease in the equilibrium water content with the content of V in the copolymer although in all cases it was superior to an EWC > 20%. The diffusion mechanism followed a Fickian behavior in all media. The values of the diffusion coefficients were in the range 2.5-1.6 10(-7) cm(2)/s. The states of water in the hydrogels were determined by DSC. A decrease in the content of freezing water was obtained with the V content for all media, and for all compositions lower values of freezing water were obtained in acidic or basic pHs than in distilled water. The copolymeric xerogels, analyzed by contact angle measurements, deviated from those expected taking into consideration those of the homopolymers and the average fraction of the monomers in the copolymer. The polar contribution dropped with the introduction of a small content (4 wt %) of the vitamin E-containing monomer, and it reached a value similar to that of poly-V for a composition of 49 wt % of V in the copolymer. This behavior is accounted for by the segregation of the macromolecular chains of both kinds of monomers, due mainly to differences in their polarity, molecular weights, and the reactivity of both monomers. Finally, thermogravimetric analysis showed a higher thermal (antioxidant) stability of the poly-V with respect to poly-H, giving rise to a residue of 18 wt %. The V-containing copolymers also showed an improved stability (antioxidant behavior), indicating the possibility of the V unit's interfering with the oxidative process, based on free-radical species, and, therefore, with the aging process at the cellular level.

As the principal formed element in a thrombus, platelets play a major role in determining the hemocompatibility of mechanical heart valves and other high-shear-rate cardiovascular devices. Since larger animals are required to test many such devices, sheep and porcine platelet responses were compared to humans. Adhesion, spreading, and the formation of thrombilike structures were examined in vitro on pyrolytic carbon mechanical heart valve leaflets, National Institutes of Health-reference polyethylene and silicone rubber, and Formvar. Principal findings were that platelet responses are strongly dependent upon the biomaterial and the species: Porcine and human platelets spread extensively on pyrolytic carbon, formed thrombuslike structures on Formvar, and were least active on silicone rubber. Human and porcine platelets responded differently to polyethylene: Human platelets spread extensively, while porcine platelets remained pseudopodial. In contrast sheep platelets attached much less, never reached fully spread shapes, and were far less active overall. Since porcine responses were generally similar to humans, pigs may be a useful predictor of in vivo platelet-biomaterial interaction in humans. Conversely, as ovine platelets were much less active, this must be accounted for in the evaluation of cardiovascular devices tested in sheep.

We hypothesized that potential for S. aureus to cause an ocular infection would be enhanced if these bacteria are able to adhere to the biomaterials used in contact lenses. In turn, bacterial adhesion could also be influenced by other factors, such as properties of contact lenses and the absorbance of some tear components. We investigated the effect of the tear protein lysozyme on S. aureus adhesion to contact lenses and its effect on production of toxins or enzymes. Methods: Bacterial adhesion on contact lenses was determined by counting the total number of bacteria as well as viable bacteria on iysozyme-coated or non-coated lenses, and by counting bacteria grown in the presence or absence of lysozyme in the medium. Toxin and enzyme production was assessed by haemolysis and proteolysis assays. Results: Our results indicate that adhesion was significantly increased in the presence of lysozyme, both in the medium and coated onto contact lenses (P = 0.04). The presence of lysozyme did not alter the production of alpha- or beta- toxins. However; the presence of lysozyme inhibited elastase activity. Conclusion: These results indicate that lysozyme deposition on contact lenses promoted S. aureus adhesion. The tear protein lysozyme might modify elastase activity and thus modulate the production of corneal degradation resulting from the action of this enzyme.","Univ New S Wales, Cornea & Contact Lens Res Unit, Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Thakur, A (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Cornea & Contact Lens Res Unit, Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,,"willcox, mark/0000-0003-3842-7563",,,,21,20,21,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0814-9763,,,AUST NZ J OPHTHALMOL,Aust.

The resulting matrix is a three-dimensional scaffold consisting of interconnected pores with an average size of 40 mu m and a high pore volume/surface area ratio. The covalent nature of the bond between the collagen fibers and the modified hyaluronate was demonstrated by extended elution with phosphate buffered saline and by extraction in increasing ionic gradients. The fraction of covalently bound hyaluronate in the matrix ranged from 5 to 25 w%. The total hyaluronate content of the COL/HA matrix affected both the in vitro non-enzymatic and enzymatic degradation as well as the in vivo turnover. When implanted in cranial defects in rats, the COL/HA matrix demonstrated good biocompatibility and exhibited greater osteoconductive potential than matrices composed of either cross-linked collagen or cross-linked hyaluronate alone.

Because the fibrinogen bound to them is functional in the classic sense of fibrin gelation, the coated microparticles may have potential as vehicles for the targeted delivery of various molecules to sites of fibrin(ogen) deposition in vivo. So that we could assess directly this potential, we first established a method for eliciting reproducibly a focal, fibrin(ogen)-rich, inflammatory lesion in a hind footpad of mice. We then monitored the tissue distribution of fibrinogen-coated microparticles following their injection into the tail vein of mice bearing this well-defined lesion. As happens with most microparticles following their intravenous administration, liposomes and oil droplets, whether coated with fibrinogen or not, accumulate rapidly in the liver and spleen of treated animals, Indeed, in the case of oil droplets, accumulation of fibrinogen-coated microparticles in those organs and in the lungs is even greater than that of fibrinogen-free microparticles, However, as distinct from fibrinogen-free liposomes and oil droplets, fibrinogen-coated microparticles also accumulate in the inflamed hind footpad. We conclude that fibrinogen-coated liposomes and oil droplets do have potential as vehicles for delivering molecules to sites of fibrin(ogen) deposition in vivo.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA","DeAnglis, AP (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",,,,,,,49,6,6,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-4513,1470-8744,,BIOTECHNOL APPL BIOC,Biotechnol.

Methods Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation was conducted by one surgeon on 86 subjects (aged 50-89 years) with cataracts. Of these subjects, 67 completed the study. Subjects were implanted either with a foldable IOL (n = 38) or a rigid IOL (n = 29), Best corrected Snellen visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (2-28 cycles/degree) were measured approximately 2 months postoperatively. Comparisons were made between the pseudophakic groups and an additional group of 28 age-matched, normal subjects (aged 58-81 years). Non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U) as well as parametric (ANOVA and Pearson) statistics tests were used in the analysis of results. Results All pseudophakes had corrected visual acuity of 6/9 or better. There were no significant differences in visual acuity (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.61) or contrast sensitivity (ANOVA, p = 0.33) between the three groups. The mean residual refractive error of the foldable IOL group was hypermetropic in comparison with the rigid IOL group but not significant at the 99% level of probability (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in astigmatism between the groups. Conclusions Implanting a foldable acrylic IOL gave no post-operative benefit in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity to pseudophakes over a less expensive rigid PMMA IOL, within this post-operative period. This study did not provide a comparison between the two lenses regarding post-operative complications, in particular the important long-term complication of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Until and if any particular advantage of a given IOL in reduced incidence of PCO is confirmed, it appears more economical to implant the conventional rigid PMMA IOL using small-incision surgery.","Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Vis Sci, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Birmingham, Acad Unit Ophthalmol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; So Gen Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Glasgow G51 4TF, Lanark, Scotland","Afsar, AJ (reprint author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Vis Sci, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,27,18,18,1,4,ROYAL COLL OPHTHALMOLOGISTS,LONDON,"17 CORNWALL TERRACE, LONDON NW1 4QW, ENGLAND",0950-222X,,,EYE,Eye,JUN,1999.0,13,,3A,,,,329,335,,,,,,7,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,215GV,WOS:000081374300009,10624427.0,,,,2019-02-25

Indeed, such polymers, which can be synthesized through different chemical and biological routes, have cleavable ester beads in their backbone for hydrolytic degradation, stereogenic centres in the monomers units for controlling the macromolecular structure, bioassimilable or non-toxic repeating units and lateral chemical functions which can be adapted to specific requirements. The strategy for building such complex architectures, with one or several specific pendant groups, is based on the anionic ring-opening polymerization or copolymerization of the large family of malolactonic and 3-alkylmalolactonic acid esters. Because we are able to control the monomer synthesis and the polymerization step, we have been able to prepare different degradable materials for the biomedical field; such as: degradable associating networks made up by the association of random copolyesters containing a small percentage of hydrophobic moieties and beta-cyclodextrin copolymers; degradable macromolecular micelles constituted by degradable amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(beta-malic acid) as hydrophilic segments and poly(beta-alkylmalic acid alkyl esters) as hydrophobic blocks; and degradable nanoparticles made up by hydrophobic poly(beta-malic acid alkyl esters) derivatives. We have also prepared a terpolymer which exhibits growth factor-like properties in vivo. Finally, poly-(beta-malic acid) has been used as an additive in the preparation of peritoneal dialysis bags.

A finite element analysis was used to determine the stress distribution along the cavo-surface margin which results from occlusal loading of each restoration. The cyclic crack growth rate of sub-surface flaws located along the dentinal cavo-surface margin were determined utilizing the Paris law. Based on similarities in material properties and lack of fatigue property data for dental biomaterials, the cyclic fatigue crack growth parameters for engineering ceramics were used to approximate the crack growth behavior. It was found that flaws located within the dentine along the buccal and lingual margins can significantly reduce the fatigue life of restored teeth. Sub-surface cracks as short as 25 mu m were found capable of promoting tooth fracture well within 25 years from the time of restoration. Furthermore, cracks longer than 100 mu m reduced the fatigue life to less than 5 years. Consequently, sub-surface cracks introduced during cavity preparation with conventional dental burrs may serve as a principal source for premature restoration failure.

Amelogenin gels were formed in vitro by sedimenting the precipitate in microcentrifuge tubes. The gels were fixed with Karnovsky fixative at 4 and 24 degrees C, which was found to preserve their corresponding clear (4 degrees C) and opaque (24 degrees C) states. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were employed for the microstructural characterization of the fixed clear and opaque gels. The amelogenin gel matrix was observed to possess a hierarchical structure of quasi-spherical amelogenin nanospheres and their assemblies. The nanospheres of diameters 8-20 nm assemble to form small spherical assemblies of diameters 40-70 nm that further aggregated to form large spherical assemblies of 70-300 nm in diameter. In the clear gel, most of the large assemblies are smaller than 150 nm, and the nanospheres and assemblies are uniformly dispersed, allowing an even fluid distribution among them. In the opaque gel, however, numerous spherical fluid-filled spaces ranging from 0.3 to 7 mu m in diameter were observed with the majority of the large assemblies sized 150-200 nm in diameter. These spaces presumably result from enhanced hydrophobic interactions among nanospheres and/or assemblies as the temperature increased. The high opacity of the opaque (24 degrees C) gel apparently arises from the presence of the numerous fluid-filled spaces observed compared to the low-temperature (4 degrees C) preparation. These observations suggest that the hydrophobic interactions among nanospheres and different orders of amelogenin assemblies are important in determining the structural integrity of the dental enamel matrix.

All materials were seeded with either pig/human retinal pigment epithelial cells or rabbit corneal endothelial cells and were maintained in tissue culture conditions. Upon confluency, the cell density was calculated and cell viability determined. All monolayers were stained with phalloidin-rhodamine for F-actin and antibodies to the tight junction (zonula occludens) protein, ZO(1), to demonstrate the presence of tight junctions. The final cell density of human RPE monolayers on PLLA films was 2950 cells/mm(2) (+/-185). The final cell density of pig RPE on PLLA and PLGA film was 2350 cells/mm(2) (+/-152 and 178, respectively). Rabbit corneal endothelial cells had a final cell density of 2650 cells/mm(2) (+/-164). F-actin staining revealed a circumferential ring of actin filaments in all of the cells grown on substrates. ZO1 immunohistochemistry demonstrated staining along the lateral cell borders of all cell types. The successful culture of retinal pigment epithelial and corneal endothelial monolayers on these substrates may have potential for transplanting cell monolayers in the eye to improve vision.","Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Dept Otolaryngol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Childrens Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Louisville, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",,,,,NEI NIH HHS [EY02853],,,28,59,71,0,5,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,JUN,1999.0,5,3,,,,,187,196,,10.1089/ten.1999.5.187,,,,10,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,211UC,WOS:000081179400001,10434067.0,,,,2019-02-25

With the development of new disciplines within biomaterials research such as tissue engineering and cellular therapy, information at molecular and structural levels is needed in order to conceive and design biomaterials that elicit specific, functional cell responses. In this study we determined the formation of focal adhesions and fibronectin fibrillar structures by human fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells adhered to fibronectin-precoated, smooth, and textured silicones as a function of time. Textures consisted of parallel ridges and 0.5 mu m deep grooves with a width of 2, 5, and 10 mu m. In addition, pillar and well constructs were used. Cells assembled focal adhesions within the first 24 h of adhesion. Fibronectin production and assembly resulted in a dense fibrillar network at day 6. Initial focal adhesion density and size were dictated by the presence of the texture. Topography also influenced initial fibronectin deposition, although the differences did not result in apparent differences in fibronectin networks after 6 days of incubation. Without fibronectin preadsorption, cells did not proliferate on the silicone surfaces. Cells adhered to glass removed all the preadsorbed fibronectin, whereas on silicone they did not. The present study shows that different textures initially give rise to differences in focal contact and fibronectin fibril assembly. The effects of the small, initial in vitro differences on in vivo tissue biocompatibility remains to be studied.","Univ Groningen, Dept Biomed Engn, Groningen, Netherlands; Ohio State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,,,,,,70,51,51,0,13,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-4947,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,JUN,1999.0,5,3,,,,,223,240,,,,,,18,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,211UC,WOS:000081179400004,10434070.0,,,,2019-02-25

Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells. Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues. The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems. The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly a-hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA). Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells. The pre shaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step. Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4 mm, articular joint defects of rabbits. Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix. 80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo. However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue. These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction. The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.","Dept Rheumatol Charite, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; German Rheumatism Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; German Rheumatism Res Ctr, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Dept Orthoped Charite, D-10098 Berlin, Germany","Sittinger, M (reprint author), Dept Rheumatol Charite, Tucholskystr 2, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,21,52,59,0,11,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,DARMSTADT,"PLATZ DER DEUTSCHEN EINHEIT 25, D-64293 DARMSTADT, GERMANY",0340-1855,,,Z RHEUMATOL,Z.

The presence of an amino group also makes it one of the most straightforward to functionalize. Unfortunately however, it tends to form micelles and hexagonal clusters instead of forming lamellar systems such as sheets and vesicles (liposomes), key supramolecular structures for a variety of biomedical and other technical applications. This has been overcome by synthesizing a dimeric phosphatidyl ethanolamine molecule in which the acyl chains at the 2-position of glycerol are joined at their termini by a carbon-carbon bond, thus resulting in a trans-membrane type fatty acyl linkage. Such tail-to-tail bipolar transmembrane lipids are found in the membranes of thermophilic and other extremophilic bacteria. The dimeric phosphatidyl ethanolamine readily forms very uniformly flat self-assembled lamellar supramolecular arrays and liposomes that are stable at temperatures up to 80 degrees C. The planar systems formed by the new lipid were characterized by atomic force microscopy, and the uniformity of the vesicles was observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, The thermal stability of the phospholipid and the vesicles formed was examined by NMR spectroscopy including proton T-1 measurements as a function of temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated a much greater order of the alkyl chain in the dimer than in phosphatidyl ethanolamine. This extremely stable and readily functionalizable dimeric phospholipid has potential uses in the fabrication of biomaterials, stable membrane models, and liposome drug-delivery systems.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Hollingsworth, RI (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,40,26,26,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0022-3263,,,J ORG CHEM,J.

Much work has been done on the use of a wide variety of cryoprotectant compounds for these types of processes. Chief among these compounds are the saccharides. They have been found to protect proteins during freezing and drying stresses as well as prevent membrane damage during cooling of cells. Trehalose, a naturally occurring disaccharide of glucose, has been found to be a particularly effective cryoprotectant. Although there are several prevailing structural and thermodynamic arguments as to why molecules such as trehalose act as cryoprotectants, little fundamental work has been done to corroborate or refute these hypotheses. To address this issue, our work has focused on the structural and dynamic simulation of this promising cryoprotective system. In this work, we have implemented fully flexible, all-atom models for water and trehalose and used both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics algorithms to calculate various macroscopic properties of trehalose solutions over a wide range of concentration. We have also studied the glass transition behavior at various concentrations and compared it to experimental data. We have observed the existence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which has been invoked to explain compressibility and molar volume data for concentrated solutions of trehalose. We have studied the diffusivity of water molecules in concentrated trehalose solutions and found a gradual transition from continuous motion through the matrix in more diluted systems to cavity-hopping motion in concentrated and near-glassy cases. Our diffusivity results have been analyzed in terms of the Williams-Landel-Feny equation; good agreement is found with published glass transition data.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","de Pablo, JJ (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem Engn, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,44,113,115,2,27,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5639,,,J PHYS CHEM A,J.

The effect of HA loadings and various thermal processing conditions on the crystallinity of the PEEK polymer and its composites were investigated using two different methods, i.e, density analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). From density analysis, it was observed that HA loadings did not influence the crystallinity of the composites as compared to DSC, which indicated that the crystallinity increased slightly with IIA loadings. Thermal processing parameters such as melt temperature, residence time and cooling rate was found to influence the structural characteristics of HA reinforced PEEK composites. In general, increasing the thermal processing parameter resulted in a decrease in crystallinity. A similar trend was observed for both the techniques used. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

These materials are chosen because they are widely used in the held of orthopedic surgery. Contact angles (sessile drop) and surface tension (du Nouy's ring method) are measured in standardized conditions which take into account the various parameters disturbing wetting phenomena. An original cumulative deposits method (CDM) described here permits observation of the evolution of the wettability and allows estimation of the protein adhesion rate. Two families of materials emerge according to their behavior when they are in contact with the protein solution. One set (a chromium cobalt alloy and two polyethylenes) presents no detectable adhesion. The other set (stainless steel, zirconia, alumina, virgin and nitrogen implanted titanium alloy) shows a cumulative adhesion of proteins. We propose to adopt a BSA buffered solution as a referential sensor to characterize solid surfaces. From the CDM, the practical parameter P*, called the adhesive wettability power, can be used in order to analyze and classify biomaterials.

Attachment of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may add to these characteristics and valorize collagen. In this study, porous type I collagen matrices were crosslinked using dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment and/or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), in the presence and absence of chondroitin sulphate (CS). EDC covalently attaches CS to collagen. DHT crosslinking preserved a porous matrix structure. However, attachment of CS to DHT-treated matrices using EDC, resulted in collapsed surfaces, CS located only at the matrix exterior. EDC crosslinking resulted in a partial matrix collapse. This could be prevented if crosslinking was carried out in the presence of ethanol. Matrix porosity was then preserved. The presence of CS during EDC crosslinking resulted in covalent immobilization of CS throughout the matrix. The amount of CS incorporated was increased if crosslinking was performed in the presence of ethanol. EDC-crosslinked matrices, with and without CS, had increased denaturation temperatures and decreased flee amine group contents. The susceptibility of these matrices towards degradation by proteolytic enzymes was diminished. Immobilized CS increased the water-binding capacity and decreased the denaturation temperature and tensile strength. Immobilized CS bound anti-CS antibodies and was susceptible to chondroitinase ABC digestion, demonstrating its bioavailability. The modified matrices were not cytotoxic as was established using human myoblast and fibroblast culture systems. It is concluded that the use of ethanol during EDC crosslinking offers an elegant means for the preparation of defined porous collagenous matrices containing bioavailable, covalently attached CS.

Reaction of DSC with BDDGE at pH 4.5 yielded a material (BD45) with a T-s of 64 degrees C, hardly any reduction in amine groups and a lower stability towards enzymatic degradation as compared to BD90. The tensile strength of BD45 (9.2 MPa) was substantially improved as compared to N-DSC (2.4 MPa), whereas the elongation at break was reduced from 210 to 140%. BD90 had a tensile strength of 2.6 MPa and an elongation at break of only 93%. To improve the resistance to enzymes and to retain the favorable tensile properties, BD45 was post-treated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to give BD45EN. Additional cross-linking via the formation of amide bonds took place as indicated by the T-s of 81 degrees C and the residual number of amine groups of 19 (n/1000). BD45EN was stable during exposure to both collagenase and pronase solutions. The tensile properties (tensile strength 7.2 MPa, elongation at break 100%) were comparable to those of BD45 and glutaraldehyde treated controls (G-DSC). Acylation of the residual amine groups of BD45 with acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (HAc-NHS) yielded BD45HAc with a large reduction in amine groups to 10 (n/1000) and a small reduction in T-s to 62 degrees C.

Every one of these procedures requires some period of contact with blood with several different biomaterials used in the manufacture of assist devices or implant devices. In view of the increasing importance of the biomaterials in clinical practice, it would be timely to review briefly physicochemical characterization as well as biological evaluations. Blood compatibility encompasses a variety of events associated with blood interaction with the biomaterials used in various procedures. Two separate coagulation mechanisms are involved (arterial and venous) depending upon the flow characteristics. At least three Interacting factors modulate normal hemostasis and the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events. They are the state of activation of coagulation cascade, circulating levels of thrombin and fibrinogen and relative activity of platelets. In this overview we discuss the current concepts on the role of platelets in blood-biomaterial interactions. When blood contacts a biomaterial surface a variety of blood components interact with the surface. Some of the key players in platelet activation on biomaterial surface include fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Currently available antiplatelet drugs effectively block aggregation and secretion induced by physiological agonists such as epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane in suspension. However, they do not prevent platelet interaction on biomaterial surfaces. Mechanisms involved in platelet activation In suspension and on surfaces as well as the pharmacology of newer antiplatelet drugs will be discussed.","Univ Minnesota, Acad Hlth Ctr, Inst Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Rao, GHR (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Acad Hlth Ctr, Inst Biomed Engn, PB 609 UMHC,420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,"Rao, Gundu H.R./0000-0002-2692-7950",,,,35,12,13,0,12,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0250-4707,0973-7669,,B MATER SCI,Bull.

The goal of this study was to characterize the in vivo antithrombin properties of a novel Dacron surface with covalently linked recombinant hirudin (rHir) implanted in a canine thoracic aorta with high flow and shear rates. rHir was bound to a knitted Dacron patch using crosslinker-modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a basecoat protein. BSA was first reacted with the heterobifunctional crosslinker, sulfo-SMCC, This BSA-SMCC complex was then bound to the carboxylic acid groups of hydrolyzed Dacron patches using the carbodiimide crosslinker, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. Iodinated, Traut's-modified rHir (I-125-rHir-SH) was then reacted with the Dacron-BSA-SMCC surface, thereby covalently binding I-125-rHir. Graft segments were washed and sonicated to remove any nonspecifically bound I-125-rHir. Dacron-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir patches (n = 5) and control Dacron-BSA patches (n = 5) were implanted in series in the thoracic aortas of canines. These patches were exposed to nonheparinized, arterial blood flow for 2 hours. Patches were explanted and assessed for I-125-rHir loss. Antithrombin activity of explanted 1-cm(2) patch segments was evaluated using a chromogenic assay with 1, 5, 10, 15 units of added thrombin. Light microscopy was performed to qualitatively examine the pseudointima. Two animals were excluded from the study owing to excessive bleeding through the knitted I-125- rHir patch. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative I-125-rHir gamma counts revealed an overall decrease of 20 +/- 5.4% over the period studied. Explanted I-125-rHir patch segments were able to inhibit 1, 5, and 7 NIHU of thrombin, demonstrating retained antithrombin activity. Gross and microscopic examination of the control and test Dacron surfaces showed marked differences. Dacron surfaces with covalently bound I-125-rHir had no gross thrombus and a thin pseudointima of platelets and plasma proteins. In contrast, the control patches had a thick pseudointima composed of fibrin-rich thrombus. rHir, covalently bound to Dacron patches, maintains its biologic activity as well as prevents thrombus formation on the graft surface. This novel antithrombin coating, by modifying the blood/ graft interface, may improve both short- and long-term patency in small-diameter prosthetic arterial grafts and has applications with respect to other implantable or indwelling biomaterials.

At 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after the operation, bone/implant interface was embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. We used the PIXE method (particle induced X-ray emission) to measure the distribution of mineral elements (Ca, P, Sr, Zn, Mn and Fe) at the bone/implant interface. At 4, 8; 16, 28 and 48 weeks after implantation we studied a biopsy of the ceramics by neutron activation method. Then, we have a global measurement of mineral elements in the biomaterial. The results showed that the resorption kinetics of hydroxyapatite doped with zinc was faster than that of the three other bioceramics.","Lab Microscopie Elect, F-51685 Reims 2, France; Lab Phys Corpusculaire Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IN2P3, F-63177 Aubiere, France; Inst Phys Nucl Expt, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Soc Ind Bioland, F-31100 Toulouse, France","Jallot, E (reprint author), Lab Microscopie Elect, 21 Rue Clement Ader, F-51685 Reims 2, France.",,,,,,,21,26,26,0,6,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-0042,,,EUR PHYS J-APPL PHYS,Eur.

Recently, we have shown that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 can independently induce human macrophage fusion to form FBGC via a macrophage mannose receptor (MR) -mediated pathway. The MR is believed to mediate both endocytosis of glycoproteins and phagocytosis of microorganisms, which bear terminal mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or glucose residues. Polarization of microfilaments to closely apposed macrophage membranes as observed with fluorescence confocal microscopy led us to ask whether MR-mediated fusion occurred via a filamentous actin-dependent pathway. Cytochalasins B and D and latrunculin-A, agents that disrupt microfilaments, inhibited macrophage fusion in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of cytochalasins D and B that inhibited fusion did not significantly decrease macrophage adhesion, spreading, or motility but did inhibit internalization of Candida albicans during interleukin-13-enhanced, MR-mediated phagocytosis, Very low concentrations of cytochalasin B (< 2 mu M) induced a slight enhancement of macrophage fusion, Taken together, the results of this study suggest that cytokine-induced, MR-mediated macrophage fusion requires an intact F-actin cytoskeleton and that the mechanism of fusion is similar to phagocytosis.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Anderson, JM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, 2085 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 55714],,,53,47,47,0,4,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,MAY,1999.0,13,8,,,,,823,832,,,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,197NZ,WOS:000080372500006,10224226.0,,,,2019-02-25

The main method used to make medical implants radiologically visible is based on blending polymers with conventional radiopaque agents, blends which usually are a physical mixture of acrylic derivatives and inorganic salts, Other methods reported involve either the formation of single-phase radiopaque polymer salt complexes somehow preventing the release of the radiopacifying element by entrapment of the complex in a crosslinked network, or radiopaque polymerized monomers characterized by a radiopacifying element associated with the monomer unit prior to polymerization, In the near future, research will certainly concentrate on biocompatible radiopaque polymers,vith covalently bound opaque elements leading to stable polymers with properties equivalent to the nonopaque, parent polymer.","Univ Geneva, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Div Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Geneva, Switzerland","Doelker, E (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, 30 Quai E Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,,,,,134,38,38,1,30,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0020-9996,,,INVEST RADIOL,Invest.

The surface chemistry of each substrate was defined by X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy, surface wettability by the dispersive, and the polar components of the surface energies. Osteoclast adhesion was modulated by the polar component of the surface energy: fewer (p < 0.01) osteoclasts adhered to C-HA (97 +/- 20/slice, surface energy 9 +/- 5 mJ/m(2)) than to HA (234 +/- 16/slice, surface energy 44 +/- 2 mJ/m(2)) or to C (268 +/- 37/slice, surface energy 58 +/- 0.5 mJ/m(2)). Actin rings, which are the cytoskeletal structure essential for re-sorption, developed on all three materials. The area of the actin ring, which is resorbed by local acidification, and the osteoclast area, which reflects osteoclast spreading, were both greater in osteoclasts cultured on IIA and C-HA than in those cultured on C. C was resorbed, hut HA and C-HA were not. Thus, we surface energy plays an Essential role in osteoclast adhesion, whereas osteoclast spreading may depend on the surface chemistry, especially on protein adsorption and/or on newly formed apatite layers. Resorption may be limited to the solubility of the biomaterial.

The materials characterization, enzymatic degradability and peptide (insulin) release from solutions of the copolymers were examined. Distribution of bioactive peptides within the polymer chain is well-known for combinations of PEG and polysaccharides as aqueous polymer two-phase systems. Insulin was preferentially partitioned into the PEG phase in a PEG/HA solution system. Enzymatic degradation of the copolymers was strongly dependent on the PEG content. Thermal analysis revealed that PEG-g-HA exhibited a variation in phase-separated structures depending on the PEG content. The solution of PEG-g-HA enabled insulin to remain in the PEG moieties dispersed in the HA matrix. Leakage of insulin from the copolymers was dependent upon the PEG content. Leakage rate of insulin from copolymer containing between 7 and 39% by weight of PEG were similar. A dramatic increase in leakage rate occurred when the PEG content was increased to greater than 39% by weight. It is considered that the loaded insulin was partitioned into the PEG moieties and became entangled with the PEG chains. The conformational change of insulin was effectively prevented in PEG-g-HA solutions, although insulin was denatured in storage of both phosphate buffered solution and HA solution. Such a heterogeneous-structured polymeric solution may be advantageous as an injectable therapeutic formulation for ophthalmic or arthritis treatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

This requires collaboration within the bioengineering and cardiothoracic surgery fields. From reviewing results of recent and past investigations, and our own preliminary study with diamond-like carbon coating (DLC) and plasma or glow discharge treatment (GDT) of MHV, we identify and discuss several potentially beneficial effects that may reduce the extent of valve-related thrombogenesis by surface modification. DLC and GDT may affect the surfaces of MHV in many ways, including cleaning of organic and inorganic debris, generating reactive and functional groups on the surface layers without affecting their bulk properties, and making the surfaces more adherent to endothelial cells and albumin and less adherent to platelets. These different effects of surface modification, separately or in combination, may transform the surfaces of MHV to be more thromboresistant in the vascular system.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Div Surg Res, Dept Surg, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch,Cooper Hlth Syst, Camden, NJ USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Div Ophthalmol Surg, Dept Surg, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch,Cooper Hlth Syst, Camden, NJ USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Div Cardiothorac Surg, Dept Surg, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch,Cooper Hlth Syst, Camden, NJ USA","Hewitt, CW (reprint author), Cooper Univ Hosp, 3 Cooper Plaza,Suite 411, Camden, NJ 08103 USA.",chewitt@umdnj.edu,,,,,,50,64,70,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1939,1521-0553,,J INVEST SURG,J.

Previous experimental work was extended by the use of MQP-B(TM) 1.4-mu m-radius particles, which have extremely high coercivity and remanent magnetic field, and in which rotation of magnetic domains within the particle does not occur. The microrheometer was tested with a series of Newtonian viscosity standards (100-10 000 poise) and found to accurately predict viscosity (error range 3%-9%). The effects of shape, size distribution, sedimentation, particle-particle magnetic interactions, and agglomeration were investigated and found to be either negligible or easily determined. This microrheometer can be used to determine the rheological properties of minute quantities of viscous fluids and may be applicable to the measurement of zero-shear-rate viscosity of viscoelastic fluids.

The aim of this study was to compare the behavior of two types of biomaterial widely used in clinical practice, polypropylene (PL) and polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), after a second laparotomy involving the implant, The behavior, in terms of tensile resistance and integration with tissues, of intact prostheses was compared to that of prostheses subjected to opening and repair. Methods: A defect (7 x 5 cm) involving all tissue layers was created in the anterior abdominal wall of 24 male New Zealand rabbits. These defects were repaired with a reticular, macroporous PL mesh (Marlex, Bard Card., Madrid, Spain) or a laminar, micro/macroporous ePTFE prosthesis (Mycro Mesh, W.L, Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) of similar size to the defect. Four study groups were established: Intact PL/Intact ePTFE (n=6 each): animals implanted with a PL or ePTFE prosthesis and sacrificed 90 days after implant; Repaired PL/Repaired ePTFE (n=6 each): animals implanted with a PL or ePTFE prosthesis subjected to midlongitudinal relaparotomy through the center of the prosthesis 90 days postimplant, followed by repair with continuous polypropylene 4/0 suture. Animals in repaired groups were sacrificed 90 days after the second intervention. Specimens comprised of prosthesis and neoformed tissue were subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, 2 cm-wide strips, consisting of the prosthesis and anchorage tissue, were subjected to biomechanical analysis using an Instron tensiometer (Instron, Canton, MA). The results obtained were statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: The intact PL implants were fully infiltrated by dense,disorganized, well-vascularized scar tissue with fibers concentric to the mesh monofilaments. The appearance of the repaired FL prostheses was similar, with establishment of neoformed tissue in repaired areas of the prosthesis such that both cut edges of the prosthesis were joined together. In contrast, intact ePTFE prostheses were encapsulated by organized tissue with fibers running parallel to the surface of the biomaterial. Repaired ePTFE prostheses including sutured areas were similarly encapsulated. But the edges of the sutured middle area did not fuse. Tensile resistance values of intact and repaired PL prostheses were similar (intact, mean, 34.78 Newtons; repaired, mean, 34.74N, p > 0.001). Tensile resistance values of intact ePTFE implants were significantly different to those of the repaired ePTFE prostheses (intact, mean, 22.64N; repaired, mean, 17.21N, p < 0.001), Breakage of both types of PL specimen strips was restricted to recipient tissue while breakage of intact ePTFE specimens occurred in the areas of anchorage to the abdominal wall. Rupture of repaired ePTFE specimens took place in the sutured central areas of the prostheses. Conclusions: We conclude that relaparotomy through an existing PL prosthesis previously integrated with the abdominal wall does not affect the tissue integration process or the tensile resistance of the implant. When the relaparotomy involves an ePTFE prosthesis, however, although the repair process itself is unaffected, significant loss in tensile strength is incurred. In addition, relaparotomy through both types of biomaterial is likely to result in the neoformation of adhesions in the areas of the prosthesis subjected to opening and repair but, in general, the number of adhesions formed in the presence of intact or repaired polypropylene implants was larger than that observed with the use of ePTFE.

These articles were coordinated by Dominique Muster (Universite' Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg) and Franz Burny (Hopital Erasme, Brussels). The following is the second of these two articles.","Univ Nottingham, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; State Univ Ghent, Dept Organ Chem, Polymer Mat Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium; Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim Organ & Ind, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Garnett, MC (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Stolnik, Snjezana/E-3531-2016; Garnett, Martin/K-3265-2012","Stolnik, Snjezana/0000-0002-2345-5062; Garnett, Martin/0000-0002-4365-4499; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,9,7,7,0,6,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DR, WARRENDALE, PA 15086 USA",0883-7694,,,MRS BULL,MRS Bull.,MAY,1999.0,24,5,,,,,49,56,,,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Materials Science; Physics,197JE,WOS:000080361000016,,,,,2019-02-25

Modern biomaterials could be composed of various components, e.g. metals, ceramics, natural tissues, polymers. In this last group, the hydrogels, hydrophilic polymeric gels with requested biocompatibility and designed interaction with living surrounding seem to be one of the most promising group of biomaterials. Especially, if they are formed by means of ionizing radiation. In early 1950s, the pioneers of the radiation chemistry of polymers began some experiments with radiation crosslinking of hydrophilic polymers. However, hydrogels were analyzed mainly from the point of view of the phenomenon associated with radiation synthesis, with topology of network and relation between radiation parameters of the processes. Fundamental monographs on radiation polymer physics and chemistry written by A. Charlesby (Atomic Radition and polymers, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1960) and A. Chapiro (Radiation Chemistry of Polymeric Systems, Interscience, New York, 1962) proceed from this time. The noticeable interest in the application of radiation techniques to obtain hydrogels for biomedical purposes began in the late sixties as a result of the papers and patents invented by Japanese and American scientists, headed by Kaetsu in Japan and Hoffman in USA. Immobilization of biologically active species in hydrogel matrices, their use as drug delivery systems and enzyme traps as well as the modification of material surfaces to improve biocompatibility and their ability to bond antigens and antibodies had been the main subjects of these investigations. In this article a brief summary of investigations on mechanism and kinetics of radiation formation of hydrogels as well as some examples of commercialized hydrogel biomaterials have been presented.

That means that the phenomena which seats at the interface between the implant and the host tissues does not induce neither any deleterious effect, such as chronic inflammatory response, nor the formation of unusual tissues. Thus it is of paramount importance to design biomaterials, used for the fabrication of implants, with the best appropriate surface properties. At the same time these biomaterials must feature bulk properties which meet other requirements, especially mechanical properties, deriving from the intended function of the implant in which they are involved. As it is quite impossible to design biomaterials which fulfil at the same time both types of requirements, it is commonly agreed that the solution to this issue goes through the selection or the design of biomaterials with adequate bulk properties, and a further treatment of the surface which would improve the properties of the latter. In this respect ionizing radiations and plasma based treatments, offer a wide panel of possibilities; as an example we describe here how the surface of expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) samples can be activated using cold plasma, in order to open a way to chemical modifications of such a surface. Subsequently, Radio Frequency Glow Discharge (RFGD) containing oligopeptides, known for their role in mediating the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, were bound to the modified surface, and the affinity of endothelial cells for the latter was investigated.

In order to reduce their thrombogenicity which remains the major obstacle, polymeric materials endowed with a specific affinity for Antithrombin III (ATIII) and thus able to catalyse the inhibition of thrombin by ATIII, as heparin does, were devised. Sulfonate and sulfonamide groups were introduced on phenyl rings belonging to styrene residues which were radiation grafted (swift heavy ions and gamma radiation) onto poly(vinylene difluoride) (PVDF) and poly(hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride) (P(VDF-HFP)). Contrary to gamma radiation grafting, with swift heavy ions grafting, only small regions are modified; thus, the properties of the initial substrate are preserved. A characterization of surface topography was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy. The efficacy of the surface modification was monitored with respect to the total amount of bound ""heparin-like"" molecules measured by a toluidine blue assay, and the anticoagulant potential estimated by the thrombin time test.

To facilitate the fabrication of complex biomaterial surfaces, we have previously described the synthesis and application of a poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) block copolymer (PLA-PEG) with the biotinylated PEG end groups (final polymer termed PLA-PEG-biotin). This polymer is biodegradable and resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, and the biotin moiety allows surface chemical engineering to be achieved using avidin-biotin interactions. Here, we describe a detailed surface analysis of this polymer using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. This analysis has revealed that the avidin-biotin surface engineering strategy is a rapid method of immobilizing biomolecules at biomaterial surfaces under aqueous conditions. The surface engineering generates a specific and high-density change in surface structure. The effect of PLA segment molecular weight and the influence of the surfactant on the nature of the surface engineering has been determined with the objective of proving that the extent of specific ligand immobilization is controllable and resilient to surface stabilization by surfactants.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009","Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,24,74,76,0,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,APR 27,1999.0,15,9,,,,,3157,3161,,10.1021/la9803575,,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,192YG,WOS:000080106900023,,,,,2019-02-25

We used optical reflectometry to measure the extent and kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption to smooth spin-cast films prepared from two poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) samples that have different end-groups, one being a hydrophilic carboxylic end group and the other a hydrophobic ester end group. One of us has previously shown that these end-groups influence microsphere degradation (Tracy et al., 1998, Factors affecting the degradation rate of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres in vivo and in vitro. Biomaterials: submitted for publication.). Both films were moderately hydrophobic, and their wettability was independent of the type of end-group. BSA adsorbed readily to both native PLG films, attaining as much as 50% surface coverage by area and was insensitive to the type of end-group. Aging the films in water for 24 h prior to BSA exposure decreased the hydrophobicity of the films and this in turn correlated with a significant decrease in the initial BSA adsorption rate. This was consistent with the often-observed trend that surface hydrophobicity favors protein adsorption. In spite of the lower adsorption affinity revealed by this decreased initial adsorption rate, the final adsorbed amounts on the aged films exceeded those attained on native films, presumably due to the increase in total surface area produced by partial PLG erosion.

We use radio-frequency glow-discharge plasma deposition to form polymeric thin films(16) around proteins coated with disaccharide molecules. The disaccharides become covalently attached to the polymer film, creating polysaccharide-like cavities that exhibit highly selective recognition for a variety of template proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, ribonuclease and streptavidin, Direct imaging of template recognition is achieved by patterning a surface at the micrometre scale with imprinted regions.","Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ratner, BD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Box 351720, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Tsai, Wei-Bor/B-7953-2011",,,,,31,522,563,6,225,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,APR 15,1999.0,398,6728,,,,,593,597,,,,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,186WX,WOS:000079754700050,10217142.0,,,,2019-02-25

Consideration of this phenotype suggested to us that the foreign body reaction (FBR) might be altered in thrombospondin 2 (TSP2)-null mice. To investigate the participation of TSP2 in the FBR, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and oxidized PDMS (ox-PDMS) disks were implanted in TSP2-null and control mice. Growth of TSP2-null and control skin fibroblasts in vitro also was evaluated on both types of disks. Normal fibroblasts grew as a monolayer on both surfaces, but attachment of the cells to ox-PDMS was weak and sensitive to movement. TSP2-null fibroblasts grew as aggregates on both surfaces, and their attachment was further compromised on ox-PDMS. After a 4-week implantation period, both types of PDMS elicited a similar FBR with a collagenous capsule in both TSP2-null and control mice, However, strikingly, the collagenous capsule that formed in TSP2-null mice was highly vascularized and thicker than that formed in normal mice. In addition, abnormally shaped collagen fibers were observed in capsules from mutant mice. These observations indicate that the presence or absence of an extracellular matrix component, TSP2, can influence the nature of the FBR, in particular its vascularity. The expression of TSP2 therefore could represent a molecular target for local inhibitory measures when vascularization of the tissue surrounding an implanted device is desired.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bornstein, P (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Box 357350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE08229]; NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL018645, HL18645]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296]",,,37,116,117,0,1,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

One approach that is used to decrease contamination of manufactured devices by microorganisms is using materials that easily slough off accumulated material (i.e., fouling release surfaces). The compounds currently used for this purpose rely on low surface energy to inhibit strong attachment of organisms. In this study, we examined the possible use of environmentally responsive (or ""smart"") polymers as a new class of fouling release agents; a surface-grafted thermally responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM), was used as a model compound. PNIPAAM is known to have a lower critical solubility temperature of similar to 32 degrees C (i.e., it is insoluble in water at temperatures above 32 degrees C acid is soluble at temperatures below 32 degrees C), Under experimental conditions, >90% of cultured microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Halomonas marina) and naturally occurring marine microorganisms that attached to grafted PNIPAAM surfaces during 2-, 18-, 36-, and 72-h incubations were removed when the hydration stale of the polymer was changed from a wettability that was favorable for attachment to a wettability that was less favorable, Of particular significance is the observation that an organism known to attach in the greatest numbers to hydrophobic substrata (i.e., H. marina) was removed when transition of PNIPAAM to a more hydrated state occurred, whereas an organism that attaches in the greatest numbers to hydrophilic substrata (i.e., S. epidermidis) was removed when the opposite transition occurred. Neither solvated nor desolvated PNIPAAM exhibited intrinsic fouling release properties, indicating that the phase transition was the important factor in removal of organisms. Based on our observations of the behavior of this model system, we suggest that environmentally responsive polymers represent a new approach for controlling biofouling release.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Chem & Nucl Engn, Farris Engn Ctr 209, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Lopez, GP (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Chem & Nucl Engn, Farris Engn Ctr 209, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",gplopez@unm.edu,"Ista, Linnea/A-5029-2016","Ista, Linnea/0000-0002-8747-9987",NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,34,119,120,0,30,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171 USA",0099-2240,,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

An adsorbed layer of calcium-phosphate was spontaneously formed on the titanium oxide surface and its thickness as well as the Ca/P ratio was found to increase with immersion time. After 71 days of immersion, the Ca/P ratio corresponded to that of brushite or monetite and after 6 months it was close to the value of hydroxyapatite. A higher Ca/P ratio was found for adsorption from solutions where the pH had been increased. After adsorption, the grains of the evaporated titanium substrate appeared slightly smoother because they were covered by a thin layer of calcium phosphate. A comparison between immersion in a Hanks' solution and solutions containing only phosphates or only calcium ions, showed that the presence of phosphates is necessary for the adsorption of Ca-ions.

The use of biomaterials in the form of microscope slides as walls in the chamber makes it possible to analyse both the biomaterial surface with regard to protein and cell binding, as well as the molecular events taking place in the fluid. Incubation of blood in the chamber, for 60 min at 37 degrees C resulted in the rapid binding of complement and coagulation proteins and of leukocytes and platelets to polyvinylchloride (PVC) slides. The cells formed a layer which more or less covered the underlying surface. Unlike complement activation, as reflected by soluble C3a and C5b-9, the thrombin-antithrombin formation was completely nullified in cell-depleted plasma Despite the fact that thrombin-antithrombin generation was also negligible in platelet-rich plasma, inhibition of platelet aggregation on the material surface with aspirin resulted in suppressed generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes. Taken together, the coagulation activation in the chamber was dependent on the presence of blood cells which suggests that bound/aggregated platelets initiate a sequence of events involving leukocytes that results in coagulation activation.

The consecutive increase of pores size as well as the use of multifilaments led to a pronounced increase of flexibility. To improve the handling during operation the initial stiffness of this low-weight large pores mesh was increased by strengthening with different amounts of absorbable polyglactin (combination of glycolide and lactide) in various forms: by coating (mesh B), adding multifilament polyglactin filaments (mesh C, Vypro(R)) or both (mesh D), respectively. To test the consequences of the different supplementary techniques all mesh Variants are implanted in a rat model. Over implantation intervals of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days we measured the tensile strength, the resulting stiffness and surveyed the tissue response, particularly in regard to the extent of inflammation and to the induced fibrosis. The results proved a sufficient mechanical stability of the material reduced and pure polypropylene mesh A without restriction of the mobility of the abdominal wall compared with a group that had simple laparotomy and closure. The histological analysis of the interface showed a minor inflammatory reaction and a dense vascularisation. The addition of polyglactin multifilaments (mesh C) reduces the number of macrophages and granulocytes as indicators for acute inflammation, showing generally a scar formation limited merely to the perifilamentary region. The abdominal wall compliance remained unchanged compared with mesh A. The coating of the polypropylene with polyglactin (mesh B and D) appeared to change the tissue reaction remarkably, favouring the formation of a connective tissue capsule around the whole mesh. The mechanical testing revealed an apparent protrusion with an increase of curvature of the artificial abdominal wall at rising intraabdominal pressures. The entire coating of the polypropylene surface with polyglactin induces an all embedding scar plate, filling out the pores and forming a tissue capsule. The complex interaction of tissue and implanted biomaterials with their distinct alterations of the tissue response confirms the necessity of in vivo experiments even after 'minor' modifications. Whereas the addition of polyglactin filaments appears to be favourable, the coating of polypropylene with polyglactin seems to hinder the incorporation of the mesh. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the control group, the defect was closed primarily. In the extraperitoneal group, polypropylene mesh was sutured over the abdominal wall after primary closure of the peritoneum and in the intraperitoneal group, polypropylene mesh was sutured to close the created defect so that it was in contact with the intestines. Main outcome measures: Bacterial translocation at 4, 24 and 48 hours. Results: Insertion of mesh in contact with the peritoneum led to increased bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes at 4 (p = 0.02) and 48 (p = 0.03) hours compared with insertion without contact. Conclusion: Contact between a foreign body and the peritoneum is required to induce bacterial translocation.","Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Ankara, Turkey; Ankara Numune Hosp, Dept Surg 6, Ankara, Turkey","Sayek, I (reprint author), Sedat Simavi Sokak 19-11, TR-06450 Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,,18,3,4,0,0,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

We have previously shown that these materials activate neutrophils by contact, leading to production of oxygen free radicals accompanied by release of granule products. Such activation further results in depletion of local host defenses, including the capacity of biomaterial-activated neutrophils to kill bacteria. Among the granule products released from neutrophils are small cationic antibacterial peptides (human neutrophil peptides [HNP]) known as defensins. Here we tested the hypothesis that defensins, released from activated neutrophils onto the surface of biomaterials, might play a role in the deactivation of subsequent neutrophil populations. Incubation of neutrophils with purified HNP resulted in a dose-related impairment of stimulus-induced oxygen radical production and of phagocytic killing. Furthermore, fresh neutrophils added to biomaterial-associated neutrophils exhibited impaired phagocytic killing. This impairment could be abrogated by antibody to HNP but not by an irrelevant antibody Taken together, these observations support the idea that neutrophils activated at a material surface can create, by means of HNP release, an environment hostile to their microbicidal function and that of their infiltrating brethren.","Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Magee Womens Res Inst, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Kaplan, SS (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Room 5930 MT CHP,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM-41734],,,79,25,26,1,5,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171 USA",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

Internal pressure gradients arise from internal heating and vaporization and significantly enhance the transport. Even a moderate internal pressure gradient in a low moisture material can cause more moisture to move to the surface than can be removed from the surface, leading to a soggy surface. A strong internal pressure gradient in a high moisture material can fully saturate the surface, leading to a very high moisture loss by liquid outflow at the surface. Addition of hot air and/or infrared heating of the surface to increase evaporation is suggested as a way to reduce surface moisture build-up. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The structural, physicochemical and mechanical parameters of these two preparations were investigated, and two different macroporous BCP1 (MBCP1) and BCP2 (MBCP2) implants were manufactured and implanted in rabbit bone for in vivo bioactivity studies. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed that MBCP1 implants had a significantly higher degradation rate (P<0.0001) than MBCP2 implants. This was probably caused by the presence of calcium oxide impurities in BCP1 and the more intimate mixture and stable ultrastructure of BCP2. No significant difference about the newly formed bone rate in these two BCP preparations was observed. Very slight variations in sintering conditions appeared to influence the biodegradation behavior of the two MBCP implants despite their identical HA/beta-TCP ratios and similar porosity.

This experimental study evaluated the osteoconductive properties of an injectable bone substitute (IBS) composed of a polymeric carrier and a calcium phosphate mineral phase, used to fill mandibular and maxillary canine extraction sockets. Methods: The polymer was a cellulose derivative (methyl-hydroxy-propyl-cellulose, MHPC), and the mineral phase consisted of granules of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics 200 to 500 mu m in diameter, Mandibular and maxillary premolars extracted from 3 dogs (a total of 60 extraction sites) were immediately treated with the IBS or left unfilled as control sites. Animals were sacrificed 3 months after implantation and all extraction sockets were prepared for histological evaluation. Results: Qualitative histological studies showed that the IBS was able to support the extensive apposition of well-mineralized newly formed lamellar bone over the entire socket surface and appeared to prevent alveolar ridge bone loss in treated extraction sites. Quantitative evaluation showed that the amount of newly formed bone was significantly higher in mandibular than maxillary extraction sockets for both treated and control sites. Conclusions: An injectable bone substitute composed of a polymeric carrier and calcium phosphate was effective in enhancing the bone fill of extraction sockets. This approach may prove promising for periodontal lesions. The material expressed osteoconductive capacities, and the biological properties of the mineral phase were conserved.","Ecole Natl Vet, Lab Chirurg, F-44307 Nantes 3, France; Fac Chirurg Dent, Equipe INSERM, Lab Rech Mat Interet Biol, Nantes, France","Gauthier, O (reprint author), Ecole Natl Vet, Lab Chirurg, Route Gachet,BP 40706, F-44307 Nantes 3, France.",,"Gauthier, Olivier/A-4639-2015; Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014; Weiss, Pierre/P-1372-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446; Weiss, Pierre/0000-0002-6159-8590; BOULER, Jean-Michel/0000-0001-9784-5584",,,,44,72,80,0,12,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690 USA",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Depending on their overall composition, these compounds are endowed with heparin-like properties such as anticoagulant activity. Indeed, some CMDBS with high CIM and S contents delay blood coagulation, whilst some derivatized dextrans without significant anticoagulant capacity are potent antiproliferative agents for rat smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro as well as heparin. The growth inhibition is dose dependent, reversible and nontoxic. This result is of prime interest for medical use because proliferation of vascular SMCs is postulated to be a key step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis or restenosis after vascular surgery such as angioplasty. By varying the overall composition in the different substituents, we have also prepared CMDBS exhibiting a stimulatory effect on the in vitro growth of human endothelial cells (EC). Heparin, under similar experimental conditions, slightly inhibited EC growth. The data indicate a synergistic role of all substituents grafted onto the dextran backbone without considering that any can be responsible alone for this effect. We conclude that a suitable distribution of CM, B and S groups on dextran can mimic heparin activity in terms of anticoagulant activity and antiproliferative capacity on SMC growth. Moreover, some CMDBS are also endowed with a stimulatory effect on EC growth. These properties confer great interest to these synthetic polysaccharides for vascular therapy.

The degree of cross-linking was evaluated by assaying the released amount of hydroxyproline (Hyp) from the matrix, and comparing it with the positive controls of valves treated by glutaraldehyde (GA) solution (0.625 wt%) and the negative controls of non-treated fresh valves. The undigested weight ratio of the specimens increased Ly increasing the UV irradiation time. The undigested weight of the leaflets, tunica interna and tunica externa of the fresh, GA-treated and UV-irradiated specimens after collagenase digestion was compared. As UV irradiation increased, the amount of released hydroxyproline was gradually decreased until 8 hours of irradiation, alter which the released hydroxyproline-reduction occurred slightly until 24 hours of irradiation time in this system. A total 47.68% of the hydroxyproline in the valve was cross-linked by UV irradiation after 24 hours, while 73.74% of the hydroxyproline in the positive control was crossed-linked. Light microscopic observation revealed that the typical crimp pattern of collagen fibers decreased and was rearranged into a dense flattened pattern as the UV irradiation induced interfibrilar cross-linking. GA-treated valves demonstrated a denser matrix pattern than the UV-irradiated specimens. Cross-linked collagenous tissue prepared by UV irradiation would be useful for improving durability and reducing the disadvantages related to using a chemical cross-linking agent.","Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, Seoul 120752, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, Seoul 120752, South Korea","Suh, H (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Engn, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",hwal@yumc.yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,36,11,11,0,1,YONSEI UNIV COLL MEDICINE,SEOUL,"50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL 120-752, SOUTH KOREA",0513-5796,1976-2437,,YONSEI MED J,Yonsei Med.

They are generally associated with clinical infections predominantly of prothetic hip joints, heart valves and catheters. Sessile microorganisms may be intimately associated with each other and to solid substratum through binding to and inclusion into exopolymer matrices an biofilms. The establishment of functional colonies within the exopolymeric matrices generate physico-chemical gradients within biofilms, that modify the metabolism and cell-wall properties of the microorganism. A consequence of biofilm growth is enhanced microbial resistance to chemical antimicrobial agents and antibiotics. Investigations on the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics, antiseptics and antimicrobial heavy ions, however, gave controversial results. No single antimicrobial substance has been developed for the efficient eradication of adherent bacteria. This review elucidates the mechanisms of microbial resistance in biofilms and strategies for the prevention of biofilm development. Pharmacokinetical and pharmacodynamical issues for the screening of biofilm-active drugs are presented. Combinations of antistaphylococcal antibiotics with rifampin may be advantageous for preventing and curing biomaterial infections.","Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Clin Orthoped, Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Clin Prothet Dent, D-50935 Cologne, Germany","Schierholz, JM (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, Goldenfelsstr 19-21, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",,,,,,,60,28,30,1,3,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0934-8840,,,ZBL BAKT-INT J MED M,Zent.bl.

At the air-water interface, the nominal equilibrium spreading area of copolymers that have the same PPO content, or ""core"", increases with increasing PEO content by an amount equivalent to the area of the hydrated ethylene ether subunits. With compression, a PEG-dependent transition from an expanded to a more condensed monolayer occurs at similar to 10 dyn.cm(-1), presumably because of condensation of PEO segments onto the core and out of the plane of the surface. Consistent with these results and interpretation, the thickness of adsorbed films of copolymers from series that have fixed cores increases approximately linearly with ethylene oxide content. At collapse of copolymer films, the nominal area per molecule-regardless of the number of ether functions in the PEO segment-is that of the hydrated PPO core. On the basis of these data, we propose models for the structure and ordering of triblock copolymers in condensed films, and we relate these models to the gradation in protein resistance observed for such films.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA","Retzinger, GS (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",,"Gehrke, Stevin/A-5265-2014",,,,,42,29,29,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,MAR 30,1999.0,15,7,,,,,2580,2585,,10.1021/la9811113,,,,6,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,183EL,WOS:000079541000050,,,,,2019-02-25

Such tissue engineering requires application of biomaterials that selectively control the attachment, morphology, and proliferation of muscle progenitor (""satellite"") cells. This study examined the initial attachment, morphological characteristics, and proliferative behavior of murine C2C12 myoblasts on glass substrata derivatized with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the organosiloxanes N-(2-aminoethyl)(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (EDA) and tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-dimethylchlorosilane (13F). The fraction of myoblasts resisting detachment upon rinsing was greater on EDA than on 13F. Application of a quantitative moments-based analysis of cell morphology demonstrated that projected area and two size-invariant metrics of shape (extension and dispersion) for these cells were greater for EDA than for 13F. Myoblasts also proliferated faster on EDA than on 13F. These data indicate that EDA-derivatized glass provides a superior substratum for myoblast culture compared to 13F-derivatized glass. Understanding myoblast behavior on these biomaterials that promotes contrasting cellular responses is the first step toward using patterned SAMs to control myotube alignment for tissue engineering skeletal muscle.

The exudate formed inside cylindrical tubes subcutaneously implanted in the dorsal region of rats was collected over a 1-week period. A rapid and simple staining procedure based on the spectral properties of the bisbenzemide Hoechst 33342 was used to identify apoptotic PMN cells. Quantification of permeabilized PMN cells stained by propidium iodide was possible in the same unfixed specimens. The percentages of apoptotic and permeabilized PMN cells in peripheral rat blood were low (1.8 +/- 0.5% and 1.7 +/- 0.7%, respectively), similar to results found in humans. In exudates generated by polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the percentages of apoptotic and permeabilized PMN cells were higher than in the blood. The percentage of PMN cells undergoing apoptosis progressively increased with time and reached a maximum at day 2 (27% +/- 6%). The percentage of permeabilized cells progressively increased with time and was much higher than the percentage of apoptotic cells on days 4 and 8. Apoptosis and necrosis of PMN cells at day 2 were inhibited when tubes were filled with 10% serum. Selective inhibition of apoptosis with a caspase inhibitor in vivo indicated that apoptosis and necrosis are two separate pathways leading to the death of PMN cells in the exudate. At day 2, polyurethane (PU) was associated with a lower rate of apoptosis than PVC or a random copolymer of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and epsilon caprolactone (ECL). Apoptosis was interpreted as an organized cell removal process that limits inflammation. Apoptosis was the natural route of PMN cell death at the early stage of inflammation.

These polymers consist of a core-shell structure that resembles conventional micellar structures but with significant thermodynamic stability in aqueous media. The core of the polymers provide a hydrophobic environment for drug encapsulation via hydrophobic interactions, whereas the shell provides excellent water solubility. The polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and mass spectroscopies, as well as gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric and elemental analyses. Encapsulation ability was measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography to monitor Lidocaine, a hydrophobic molecule. Encapsulation capabilities increased as lipophilicity of the core increased. To verify that encapsulation was caused by individual unimolecular micelles, surface tension and dynamic light scattering measurements were performed. The results indicated that these unimolecular micelles have great potential as drug carriers.

Several studies suggest, however, that the conformation or orientation of immobilized fibrinogen rather than the total amount adsorbed plays an important role in determining the blood compatibility of biomaterials. The purpose of this study was to investigate time-dependent functional changes in fibrinogen adsorbed to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene (PE), and silicone rubber (SR). Fibrinogen was adsorbed to these materials for 1 min and then allowed to ""reside"" on the surfaces for up to 2 h prior to assessing its biological activity. Changes in fibrinogen reactivity were determined by measuring the adhesion of Cr-51-labeled platelets, the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against an important functional region of the fibrinogen molecule (the gamma-chain dodecapeptide sequence 400-411), and the ability of blood plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion differed among the polymeric materials studied, and PTFE and PE samples exhibited a small decrease in adhesion with increasing fibrinogen residence time. Platelet adhesion to SR was the least among all materials studied and showed no variation with residence time. When using PTFE and SR as substrates, mAb recognition of adsorbed fibrinogen did not change with residence time whereas that on PE decreased slightly. The mAb binding was least to fibrinogen adsorbed to SR, which is in agreement with the platelet adhesion results. Finally, the ability of plasma to displace previously adsorbed fibrinogen decreased dramatically with increasing residence time on all materials. These in vitro studies support the hypothesis that fibrinogen undergoes biologically significant conformational changes upon adsorption to polymeric biomaterials, a phenomenon that may contribute to the hemocompatibility of the materials following implantation in the body.

Segments of different types of suture with adherent bacteria were implanted subcutaneously into mice. The infection risk with Staphylococcus aureus was greater than with Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A or Candida albicans. The infection risk with the implantation of multifilament sutures was significantly greater than with monofilament sutures. When <10 colony forming units (cfu) of S. aureus were present on monofilament suture material, the infection rate was 3%. When <10 cfu of S. aureus were present on multifilament suture material, the infection rate was 7%. An infection rate of 15% occurred with <10 cfu of S. aureus on multifilament nylon sutures. When >10 but <20 cfu of S. aureus were present, the infection rates were 4 and 51%, respectively. These data confirm that the infection rate with multifilament sutures (or porous materials) is greater than with monofilament sutures (or solid materials) when the organisms are encountered at implantation (acute model) and indicate that a significant risk of infection may occur when only a few organisms are on a device at implantation.

We had hypothesized that material-induced neutrophil activation was an important parameter associated with material failure. All materials tested [cellophane, an acrylonitrile copolymer (AN69), Pellethane(TM) nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, low density polyethylene, and polydimethylsiloxane] activated isolated human neutrophils, which were resuspended in plasma or serum, to similar extents based on L-selectin shedding, CD11b upregulation, and stimulation of the oxidative burst after 30-min exposure. Inhibition of complement activation by sCR1 unexpectedly had Little effect if any on nonadherent neutrophils. However, neutrophil adhesion, but not the level of activation of the adherent cells, was strongly dependent on complement activation. Pretreatment with albumin did not inhibit adhesion or reduce neutrophil activation, but plasma pretreatment resulted in increased activation for nonadherent and adherent cells. More adhesion and a higher level of activation of adherent cells was observed following pretreatment with fibrinogen, a ligand of CD11b. Taken together these results suggest that upon contact with a material, neutrophil activation may occur though mechanisms that are not mediated by complement. For example, the presence of plasma proteins such as fibrinogen at the interface may trigger activation and the release of other activating agents. Although the material differences are small, the extent of activation may be significant and warrant further study of the mechanism and consequences of that activation.

In a recent study we found impaired fibronectin receptor function on hydrophobic substrata (G. Altankov et al. J Biomater Sci Polym Edn 1997;8:712-740). Here, we have studied the distribution and function of the vitronectin receptor (alpha(v) integrin) in fibroblasts adhering on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyl glass (ODS). The morphology of fibroblasts and the organization of actin cytoskeleton were studied and found to be altered on ODS, where the cells did not spread and possessed condensed actin. Pretreatment of the surfaces with serum or pure vitronectin improved cell morphology on both substrata, resulting in the development of longitudinal actin stress fibers. It was found with biotinylated vitronectin that comparable quantities of vitronectin were adsorbed from single vitronectin solutions or serum on glass and on hydrophobic ODS. The organization of the vitronectin receptors on the ventral cell surface was investigated in permeabilized cells showing normal focal adhesions in fibroblasts plated on glass but none of these structures on ODS. The distribution of alpha(v) integrin on the dorsal cell surface was studied on nonpermeabilized living cells after antibody tagging. While fibroblasts adhering on plain or serum-treated glass developed a Linear organization of alpha(v) integrin, cells on plain and serum-treated ODS were not able to reorganize the vitronectin receptor. Studies on signal transduction with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed co-localization of alpha(v) integrin and phosphotyrosine in focal adhesions on glass and serum-treated glass. However, signaling was almost absent on plain ODS and weak on serum-treated ODS. It was concluded that alterations in vitronectin receptor function on the ventral cell surface caused by the hydrophobic material surface inhibit signal transfer and subsequent intracellular events that are important for the organization and function of integrins.

To decrease the complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass, novel biomaterials have been introduced that may be less thrombogenic than standard synthetic surfaces. Methods. Thirty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to bypass using either a control circuit or a circuit prepared ""tip-to-tip"" with a triblock-copolymer (polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone). Results. There was a progressive increase in thrombin generation in the control group during bypass, which was not seen in the test group. The test surface decreased the release of tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complex formation (p < 0.005). There was also an increased platelet count and a decreased platelet activation in the test group, as detected by GMP-140 expression and beta-thromboglobulin release (p = 0.017). There was also significantly more debris that accumulated on the arterial filter in the control group, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Conclusions. This clinical trial has demonstrated a significant difference in the hematologic effects of the test circuits, with evidence of platelet preservation, decreased fibrinolysis, and decreased thrombin generation. A larger trial would be necessary to establish the clinical relevance of these differences.

Factors that govern bone cell, ie osteoblast, adhesion and ECM elaboration significantly influence its re-modeling into mature bone, and ultimately its ability to integrate with biomaterials used for orthopedic prostheses. Ln this study we have investigated how treatment with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that promotes ectopic bone formation, modulates the organization and expression of osteoblastic cell proteins. Specifically, we analyzed how BMP-2 treatment affects cytoskeletal components, ECM, and alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin receptor subunits in osteoblastic cells plated on Ti6Al4V, a titanium alloy widely used for orthopedic implants that interacts with bone cells in vitro and in vivo. Osteoblastic cells were pre-treated with BMP-2 for 12 h prior to plating; BMP-2 treatment stimulated adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells and this adhesive advantage was reflected in enhanced long-term matrix mineralization in the BMP-2 pretreated cultures. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis of BMP-2 treated cells showed that enhanced cytoskeletal organization and focal contact formation occurred. These changes were accompanied by a concomitant increase in the spatial organization of fibronectin, whereas vitronectin, collagen type I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin showed little change. The changes in ECM organization correlated with increased fibronectin, alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin subunit, and focal adhesion kinase (p125(FAK)) expression, as well as increased p125(FAK) phosphorylation. By confocal microscopy, the alpha 5 integrin subunit was more concentrated in lamellipodia after BMP-2 treatment. These results demonstrate that BMP-2 significantly altered osteoblastic cytoskeletal and ECM organization and enhanced expression of fibronectin and of specific integrin receptor subunits, with concomitant changes in the levels and phosphorylation of p125(FAK). These effects may contribute to downstream cellular responses important for bone cell function, and growth.

A water uptake ability test, in vitro drug release and collagenase degradation tests, and an in vivo animal test were employed to confirm the applicability of this gelatin-alginate sponge as a wound dressing material. As the alginate content in the sponge increased, the porosity increased, resulting in an enhanced water uptake ability. Sponges loaded with silver sulfadiazine or gentamicin sulfate slowly released drugs for up to four days. The crosslinked sponge resisted in vitro collagenase digestion for up to three days.

The present study was aimed at reconstruction of abdominal wall muscle using processed dermal sheep collagen (DSC) and myoblast seeding. Myoblasts were harvested from foetal quadriceps muscle of an inbred rat strain, cultured, seeded as non-differentiated cells into DSC-discs and incubated in vitro for 2 h. The discs were implanted in the abdominal wall defects in adult rats. Non-seeded discs functioned as control. Implantation periods till week 6 were chosen. At day 1 and 2 after implantation infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages was clearly more intense in the seeded discs than in the controls. Relatively large numbers of mast cells infiltrated from the side of the adhering omentum. In central areas of the discs, seeded cells were easily recognized till day 5, since non-seeded control discs did not contain such cells. Ingrowth of host cells and tissue at the margins proceeded faster with the seeded discs. Lymphocyte accumulations were observed in the 3 week seeded specimen. At week 3 and week 6, in the seeded discs muscle tissue was not present, in contrast to very large giant-like cells. It is concluded that the chosen method of myoblast seeding did not result in the regeneration of muscle during this observation period. Unfavorable circumstances such as humoral factors, direct cellular interactions (phagocytosis), indirect cellular interactions (cytokines), or initial absence of vascularization, may play a role.

The aim of this work was to study the in vitro toxicity of solutions of these radio-opacifiers using two cell culture models. Primary-cultures of human urothelial cells (HUC) arising from normal adult urinary tract and permanent urothelial cell line were used. Solutions at different dilutions were placed into the wells containing monolayers of confluent cells. After 24 h incubation period, the solutions were removed and cell viability and cell metabolic activity tests were performed (Neutral Red assay and MTT assay). At a concentration lower than 1 mg 1(-1) the different radio-opacifiers used showed no toxicity. From 1 to 3 mg 1(-1) one can note a significant dose-dependent decrease of cell metabolic activity of solely HUC for barium chloride. At 3 mg 1(-1) one can note a significant deleterious effect on HUC metabolic activity, with bismuth and tantale. For tungsten, there is no deleterious effect, but on the contrary a significant increase in HUC metabolic activity at a 0.5 mg 1(-1) concentration. None of the solutions did provoke alterations in HUC viability for concentrations less than 3 mg 1(-1). Interestingly, for permanent cell line one can note a solely significant decrease of cell viability at 3 mg 1(-1) for tantale. All the other tested salts on permanent cell line were not significantly different from controls for cell viability as well as cell metabolic activity. HUC culture model may be of relevance for the screening of radio-opacifiers intended for ureteral endoprostheses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A number of cross-linking methods have been tested in biological tissues composed mainly of collagen. The basis for most of them is the use of glutaraldehyde (GA), which acts on the Lys or Hyl residues. We have studied the effects of alternative chemical treatments: diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) and ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDAC). Their mechanism of action is based on the activation of the carboxyl groups, which then permits their cross-linking to amino groups. As a control, we employed conventional treatment with GA, applying it to bovine pericardium and collagen membranes removed from bovine pericardium. The analysis of the Lys and Hyl residues showed that DPPA and EDAC produced 50% of the chemical change provoked by GA. This value was even lower in the trials with collagen. In terms of the resistance to collagenase degradation, chemical cross-linking with GA provided much greater protection in both materials (3.81 +/- 3.47 nmol of amino acid/mg dry tissue for pericardium and 4.41 +/- 1.13 nmol of amino acid/mg dry tissue for collagen). Treatment with DPPA also protected pericardium (13.11 +/- 6.57 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue) although the values for collagen was lower (50.0 +/- 32.4 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue).Treatment with EDAC was much less protective than the other two chemical reagents (43.28 +/- 17.4 and 55.85 +/- 14.57 nmol amino acid/mg dry tissue for pericardium and collagen, respectively). The degree of tissue calcification after implantation of the chemically treated materials into young rats was considerably greater for GA and DPPA (32.9 +/- 18.8 and 36.3 +/- 13.3 mg g(-1) dry tissue, respectively) than with EDAC (18.0 +/- 7.2 mg g(-1) dry tissue; P < 0.001). After 60 days of implantation, the values for GA and EDAC were higher (124.1 +/- 31.3 and 124.6 +/- 21.0 mg g(-1) dry tissue, respectively) versus 34.6 +/- 19.2 mg g(-1) dry tissue for DPPA. There were no significant differences in collagen levels in samples treated with GA or EDAC after 30 days of implantation, although both groups showed significant differences when compared with DPPA-treated samples (P < 0.001). After 60 days of implantation, there were no significant differences among these three treatments in terms of the calcium accumulated on samples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is well established that after implantation that proteins will be adsorbed on to the surface of biomaterials and may then influence the development of surface mineralised layers. Hydroxyapatite was synthesised by wet method and electrophoretically deposited over 316L stainless steel at optimised coating parameters. The corrosion behaviour of the coated materials was evaluated under physiological conditions using 0.9% saline solution with addition of 10% bovine serum by cyclic polarisation studies.

The polymers coated are silicone and polyethylene, and the effect on the friction coefficient is studied. Film adhesion is found to depend on the DLC film refractive index (n), whereas the friction is largely independent of kn in the range studied. Films were deposited from a He/C2H2 mixture at 20 Pa (0.15 Torr) on to the polymer substrates placed on a 10-cm-diameter electrode driven at 13.56 MHz. Film growth was monitored by in-situ ellipsometry (at 675 nm), which was performed on a glass slide placed near the polymer substrate. Friction measurements were obtained using a pin-on-disk tribometer, and measurements were carried out using a stainless-steel pin at a linear speed of 6 cm s(-1) Film adhesion was evaluated using a pull-adhesion tester. It was found that DLC coatings adhere well to the polymer substrates and can significantly reduce the friction coefficient of polymers such as silicone. Higher refractive index films (which are harder and have a higher mechanical strength) were found to have a poorer adhesion and provide a slightly increased friction on the polymer surface when compared to lower-index films. This study indicates that DLC may be used to enhance the tribological properties of polymers with potential applications in the biomaterials and light-engineering industries.

Since the nature of bone cell responses in vitro is influenced by the properties of HA ceramics, this study was divided into 2 components: a chemical and crystallographic characterization of the HA ceramics, and an in vitro cell culture study. Sintered HA samples were observed to have the highest crystallite size, compared to as-received HA and calcined HA samples. No differences in surface roughness and chemical composition were observed between the sintered, calcined, and as-received HA surfaces. In concurrence with the x-ray diffraction, high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Ca 2p also indicated a higher crystallinity on sintered HA samples compared to calcined and as-received HA samples. Protein production by osteoblast cells was not statistically different on the 3 HA surfaces in the absence of TGF-beta. However, there was a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta-stimulated protein produc tion on the 3 different HA surfaces. As indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, as well as 1,25 (OH2) vitamin D-3-stimulated osteocalcin production, a more differentiated osteoblastlike phenotype was observed on the sintered HA surfaces compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA surfaces. An increased osteoblast-like cell activity on sintered HA surfaces in the presence of different TGF-beta dosage suggested that sintering of HA surfaces may play an important role in governing cellular response.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Biomat, Dept Restorat Mat, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Endodont, San Antonio, TX USA; CeraMed Corp, Lakewood, CO USA","Ong, JL (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Biomat, Dept Restorat Mat, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA.",,,,,,,45,15,17,0,3,QUINTESSENCE PUBLISHING CO INC,HANOVER PARK,"4350 CHANDLER DRIVE, HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 USA",0882-2786,1942-4434,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

In vitro adhesion of platelets on the PE was evaluated. The exposure of animals to stress induced a dramatic change in platelet morphology and functions on the PE: a higher degree of platelet adhesion, increased platelet spreading, and the appearance of pseudopodia, In the unstressed subjects there were no modifications of the platelets on the PE with respect to the baseline. The present experiment emphasizes for the first time the possible problems involved with the varying physiological conditions of patients before and after any biomaterial application surgery and of subjects who supply the blood for hemocompatibility tests performed on biomaterials.

However, there is a possibility that these materials are responsible for an unwanted inflammatory response during wound healing. Since TCP is soluble in the body, the instability of this material may contribute to this inflammatory response. Using composite ceramics of TCP and HAP that possessed Ca/P molar ratios of 1.50, 1.55, 1.60, 1.64, and 1.67, the effect of surface instability on fibroblast L-929 cells was investigated. The time-dependent variation of the initial anchoring ratio, cell density, and cell viability were measured. In general, the cells were severely damaged and ruptured on the highly soluble thin surface layer of the TCP-HAP ceramics. The initial anchoring ratio for TCP-HAP ceramics was as high as that for the polystyrene dish (Lux, control). However, viability at 6 h decreased to less than 50% of the initial cell density on ceramics with a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.64 (20% TCP-80% MAP), while 85% of the cells were viable on Lux. The viability on 100% TCP, whose surface is the most highly soluble among the TCP-HAP ceramics used in this study, was reduced to 20%. Morphological observation showed that the anchored cells were ruptured when grown in culture medium on the 100% TCP. Although the high solubility of the thin surface layer on the TCP-HAP ceramics of the carrier was found to be the dominant factor in the decreasing cell viability, the initial viability was enhanced by the stabilization of the surface of the TCP-HAP ceramics by pre-incubating the scaffolds in a culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 d.","Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Chiba 2788510, Japan; Natl Ind Res Inst Nagoya, Bioceram Lab, Nagoya 4628510, Japan","Suzuki, T (reprint author), Sci Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, 2641 Yamazaki, Chiba 2788510, Japan.",,"nagata, fukue/M-8449-2018; Nishizawa, Kaori/F-8655-2011","nagata, fukue/0000-0002-5284-9626; Nishizawa, Kaori/0000-0002-3143-1298",,,,41,30,30,0,2,SOC BIOSCIENCE BIOENGINEERING JAPAN,OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA, 565-0871, JAPAN",1389-1723,,,J BIOSCI BIOENG,J.

It describes how death, ageing, degeneration, pathology and individual variability influence the properties of natural tissues. Experimental problems arise from degradation and testing conditions; these are illustrated by the properties of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. Replacement of natural tissues by graft materials and the products of tissue engineering is then described. Synthetic replacement materials should be biocompatible, i.e. they should not cause adverse reactions in the human body. However, polymers which hydrolyse in the body fluids may be useful for implants which are intended to have a limited life or for controlled release of drugs. Synthetic implant materials may attempt to mimic natural tissues but there may be a problem of attaching them to the surrounding tissue, Artificial ligaments provide an example of implants of this kind. Total hip replacement is used to illustrate the successful use of conventional engineering materials, Finally, safety issues are described; an implant material must be biocompatible, have the required mechanical strength, be sterile and should be incorporated into a device so that its performance in the living patient can be monitored.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Aberdeen, Scotland","Hukins, DWL (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Aberdeen, Scotland.",d.hukins@biomed.abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,46,36,36,1,12,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0959-9428,1364-5501,,J MATER CHEM,J.

This in vivo implantation technique is used to test new materials as putative delivery vehicles in skeletal tissue-engineering models. HYAFF 11 and ACP sponges, two biomaterials based on hyaluronic acid modified by esterification of the carboxyl groups of the glucuronic acid, were tested as osteogenic or chondrogenic delivery vehicles for rabbit mesenchymal progenitor cells and compared with a well characterized porous calcium phosphate ceramic delivery vehicle. The implant materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy for differences in pore structure or cellular interactions, were quantified for their ability to bind and retain mesenchymal progenitor cells, and were examined histologically for their ability to support osteogene sis and chondrogenesis after subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. The ACP sponge bound the same number of cells as fibronectin-coated ceramic, whereas the HYAFF 11 sponge bound 90% more. When coated with fibronectin, ACP and HYAFF 11 bound, respectively, 100 and 130% more cells than the coated ceramics. HYAFF 11 sponge composites retained their integrity after the 3 or B-week incubation period in the animals and were processed for histomorphometric analysis. As a result of rapid degradation or resorption in vivo, ACP sponges could not be recovered after implantation and could not be analyzed. HYAFF 11 sponges presented more area available for cell attachment and more available volume for newly formed tissue. Following loading with mesenchymal progenitor cells and implantation, the pores of the sponges contained more bone and cartilage than the pores of ceramic cubes at either time point. Thus, relative to ceramic, HYAFF 11 sponges allow incorporation of twice as many cells and produce a 30% increase in the relative amount of bone and cartilage per unit area. Hence, the hyaluronic acid-based delivery vehicles are superior to porous calcium phosphate ceramic with respect to the number of cells loaded per unit volume of implant, and HYAFF 11 sponges are superior to the ceramics with regard to the amount of bone and cartilage formed. Additionally, hyaluronic acid-based vehicles have the advantage of degradation/resorption characteristics that allow complete replacement of the implant with newly formed tissue.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Caplan, AI (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Skeletal Res Ctr, 2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,"Sano, Michael/E-1715-2011","Caplan, Arnold/0000-0002-8677-6621",,,,35,298,310,2,65,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192 USA",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Three kinds of surface conditions of amorphous alloys were prepared: as-received (by single roller melt spinning method), polished and just-polished (within 300 s after polishing). Polished crystalline alloys were also polarized as controls. I-corr (corrosion current density) and I-crit (critical passive current density) of the as-received amorphous alloys and the polished crystalline alloys decreased with increasing chromium content. Corrosion resistance of these alloys was improved by the addition of chromium. I-corr, I-crit and I-ps (passivation current density) of the polished amorphous alloys were lower than those of the polished crystalline alloys and these values of the former alloys were independent of chromium content. This indicates that corrosion resistance of the polished amorphous alloys is higher in the artificial body fluid than that of the polished crystalline alloys. To determine the cathodic reactant on the as-received amorphous alloys in deaerated PBS(-), one of the alloys was polarized in deaerated 2.5 kmol%H2SO4. The cathodic Tafel slope in PBS(-) was the same as that in H2SO4, indicating that the cathodic reactant in PBS(-) was identified as hydrogen ion. Ln addition, polarization curves of pure palladium, pure copper and pure chromium were examined to determine the anodic reaction. E-corr (corrosion potential) of the pure palladium was similar to those of the alloys, suggesting that palladium ion is preferentially released from the alloys under the immersion in deaerated PBS(-). I-corr, and I-crit of the polished amorphous alloys were lower than those of the as-received amorphous alloys. To discuss the improvement in corrosion resistance by polishing, just-polished alloys were also polarized. The curves of the as-received and the just-polished alloys contained negative loop except the polished alloys. I-corr and I-crit of the just-polished alloys were slightly larger than those of the polished alloys. These results indicate that the surface morphology of the amorphous alloys changed during the exposure to air, causing the increase in corrosion resistance.","Natl Res Inst Met, Sci & Technol Agcy, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hiromoto, S (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Met, Sci & Technol Agcy, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan.",,"BAI, JIE/D-7448-2016; HIROMOTO, Sachiko/H-2686-2011",,,,,9,9,9,0,0,JAPAN INST METALS,SENDAI,"1-14-32, ICHIBANCHO, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, 980-8544, JAPAN",0021-4876,1880-6880,,J JPN I MET,J.

A single wheat grain with a known amount of moisture was placed on the MRR at two different orientations (0 degrees and 90 degrees) with respect to the feedline. The resonance frequency (f(r)), bandwidth (B) and quality factor (Q(r)) of the MRR were calibrated against the moisture content. The measurements were made with a scalar network analyser. The sensor was studied in the normal useful moisture range of 11-32% (on a wet-weight basis), the actual moisture values being obtained by an oven-drying method. The 0 degrees orientation was more sensitive to moisture than was the 90 degrees orientation. The total changes in f(r) for a 21% change in moisture content for 0 degrees and 90 degrees orientations were 235 and 150 MHz, respectively. The errors in moisture estimation with f(r) for 0 degrees and 90 degrees were +/-2.06% and +/-2.09%, respectively. The corresponding values with B and Q(r) for 90 degrees orientation were +/-2.14% and +/-2.19%, respectively. The proposed sensor is more sensitive than a reported waveguide resonator and is easy to operate, for the microstrip offers an open structure, thereby facilitating easy loading and unloading of the samples.","Univ Pune, Dept Phys, RCMF Transducer Lab, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Abegaonkar, MP (reprint author), Univ Pune, Dept Phys, RCMF Transducer Lab, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",rca@physics.unipune.ernet.in,,,,,,18,27,29,0,7,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0957-0233,1361-6501,,MEAS SCI TECHNOL,Meas.

The goal of the reported studies was to investigate the effect of fluid flow on the morphology, phagocytic function and stress response induction in adherent immune cells. Shear approximating arterial, venous and intermediate levels were applied onto glass-adherent IC21 macrophages in a temperature-controlled parallel plate flow system. The results indicate that fluid flow induces a shear-dependent physiological stress response in adherent macrophages and that significant morphological changes accompany macrophage responses to shear stress. In addition, arterial flow conditions induce not only significant cell polarisation, but also enhanced phagocytic ingestion in glass-adherent IC21 macrophages. These findings suggest that blood flow induced shear stress may not only be consequent to adherent leukocyte activation, but may also be integral to the regulation of adherent leukocyte behaviour in vivo.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Moghe, PV (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",,,,,,,45,7,7,0,5,PETER PEREGRINUS LTD,HERTS,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE, SIX HILLS WAY, STEVANAGE, HERTS SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",0140-0118,,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

The resulting replica is removed from the methacrylate cast. Results indicate the highest level of spatial resolution is obtained using a modified Murakami resin for the negative cast and polystyrene for the positive replica. The 29-nm-wide repeat banding structure present on collagen fibrils could be clearly identified in both the methacrylate cast and in the polystyrene positive replica of the methacrylate cast.

Bubble collapse in liquids results in an enormous concentration of energy from the conversion of the kinetic energy of liquid motion into heating of the contents of the bubble. The high local temperatures and pressures, combined with extraordinarily rapid cooling, provide a unique means for driving chemical reactions under extreme conditions. A diverse set of applications of ultrasound to enhance chemical reactivity has been explored, with important applications in mixed-phase synthesis, materials chemistry, and biomedical uses. For example, the sonochemical decomposition of volatile organometallic precursors in low-volatility solvents produces nanostructured materials in various forms with high catalytic activities. Nanostructured metals, alloys, carbides and sulphides, nanometre colloids, and nanostructured supported catalysts can all be prepared by this general route. Another important application of sonochemistry to materials chemistry has been the preparation of biomaterials, most notably protein microspheres. Such microspheres have a wide range of biomedical applications, including their use as echo contrast agents for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, and oxygen or drug delivery.","Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,"Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011; Hyeon, Taeghwan/J-5315-2012","Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701; Lee, Junyoung/0000-0001-6689-2759",,,,64,402,406,3,88,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Water-soluble synthetic polymers have also been crosslinked with molecules of biological origin, such as oligopeptides(13) and oligodeoxyribonudeotides(14), or with intact native proteins(15). Very often there are several factors influencing the relationship between structure and properties in these systems, making it difficult to engineer hydrogels with specified responses to particular stimuli. Here we report a hybrid hydrogel system assembled from water-soluble synthetic polymers and a well-defined protein-folding motif, the coiled coil. These hydrogels undergo temperature-induced collapse owing to the cooperative conformational transition of the coiled-coil protein domain.

A second objective was to consider what approaches NSF could use to optimize, through research and education, the development of interdisciplinary MMSE. In the fall of 1996 Andrew Lovinger approached Prof. S.I. Stupp to chair the workshop and form an organizing committee. The first step was to solicit opinions from the community at. large on what directions were perceived to be important and exciting. Based on input from the community, five discussion groups for the workshop covering the following themes: novel macromolecular structures : synthesis and function; control of properties through innovative processing; solving environmental problems with macromolecular science and engineering; macromolecular science connections between the physical and biological sciences; and translating macromolecular discoveries into technologies. The selection of these particular topics for the workshop was nor meant to exclude the vast number of other areas in macromolecular science and engineering that are scientifically and technically important. The topics of the workshop were selected because they were identified as exciting areas of opportunity with a high interdisciplinary content. The content of recommendations made by each discussion group varies; some emphasized research directions and others educational issues or funding procedures. These differences reflect the nature of each topic and also the specific concerns of individuals in the discussion group.","Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SOC FRANCAISE CHIMIE,PARIS,"250 RUE SAINT-JACQUES, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE",0151-9093,,,ACTUAL CHIMIQUE,Actual Chim.,FEB,1999.0,,2,,,,,3,5,,,,,,3,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,176WK,WOS:000079174900002,,,,,2019-02-25

Methods: Similar-sized endplates made of 3 different biomaterials were sutured to the sclera in the superotemporal quadrant of the rabbit eye. Thirty eyes of 15 albino New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to the 3 groups. Conjunctival vascular hyperemia was graded in a masked fashion among groups. At the end of 3 weeks, the enucleated eyes were examined histologically and using scanning electron microscopy. Results: Polypropylene and Vivathane were associated with significantly more inflammation in clinical observations and based on histological grading. Silicone was associated with the least amount of inflammation. Three polypropylene and 1 Vivathane plate were extruded between the second and third week. Conclusions: Silicone is the most inert of the 3 materials tested. Inflammation associated with biomaterials may contribute to the failure of the glaucoma drainage devices. Clinical Relevance: Bleb inflammation may be related to the biomaterial being used as the endplate. Endplates should be handled carefully during surgery to avoid creating rough spots.","Watson Clin, Dept Ophthalmol, Lakeland, FL USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Surg, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Ophthalmol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Pathol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Ayyala, RS (reprint author), 12901 Bruce B Downs Blvd,MDC 21, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",,,"Haller, Edward/0000-0002-8535-2181",,,,10,68,71,1,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0003-9950,,,ARCH OPHTHALMOL-CHIC,Arch.

Subcutaneous sites lack adequate vascularization to nutritionally support transplanted hepatocytes. We recently reported that matrix-immobilized angiogenic growth factors, e.g., endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), can induce a high degree of neovascularization. Using this technique, we explored the possibility of transplanting isolated fetal porcine hepatocytes to create liver tissue organoids at a specific subcutaneous site. We evaluated chitosan as a scaffold biomaterial because of its structural similarity to glycosaminoglycans; glycosaminoglycans play a critical role in cell attachment, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Freshly isolated fetal porcine hepatocytes (FPH) (viability greater than 97%) were cultured on modified chitosan scaffolds and transplanted into rat groin fat pads with or without ECGF-induced neovascularization. Cell density and attachment kinetics on chitosan were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified using a flavianic acid binding assay. Hepatocyte viability and liver organoid formation were examined immunohistochemically. FPH transplanted without prior neovascularization died within 1 day posttransplantation. When transplanted after ECGF-induced neovascularization, FPH thrived for at least 2 weeks and formed liver tissue like structures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of hepatocyte-specific cytokeratin staining as well as the presence of alpha-fetoprotein. Light microscopy and SEM revealed that FPH did not change their morphology after attachment to the chitosan surfaces. Thus, chitosan-based biomaterial surfaces have good hepatocyte attachment properties, However, extensive neovascularization is essential for hepatocyte survival and organoid formation. In the future, chitosan-based biomaterials may be useful as scaffolds for creating liver tissue organoids.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Liver Biosupport & Hepatitis Res Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Ankara Univ, Dept Chem, Ankara, Turkey","Dixit, V (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Liver Biosupport & Hepatitis Res Lab, 675 Circle Dr S,MRL Room 1240, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,"Elcin, Yasar Murat/0000-0003-1037-0825",,,,25,49,58,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Saos-2 cells were plated on Tivanium (Tiv, Ti-6Al-4V), Zimaloy (Zim, Co-Cr-Mo) and glass disks. The cells were cultured in a-TviEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg ml( )(-1) ascorbic acid. The cultures were analyzed for calcification and for mRNA expression for ECM proteins after 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Calcium content was significantly higher in cells on Tiv, less on Zim and least on glass disks. With the addition of 3 mM b-glycerophosphate (b-GP), the cell layer was more calcified on Zim than on Tiv and all substrates had three times more calcium than cultures without b-GP. All subsequent experiments were performed without b-GP. Phalloidin immunofluorescence microscopy of the actin-based cytoskeleton at 2 weeks demonstrated nodules composed of multilayered, cobblestone-appearing osteoblasts overlying calcified matrix which was stained with calcein. On Tiv, calcified nodules were connected in a trabecular-like pattern while on Zim, calcification was dispersed throughout the cell layer. Northern blots for alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and al(I) procollagen mRNAs were performed at different time points. The amount and pattern of calcification as well as the expression of ECM-mRNAs differed on each implant material. The results indicate that Tiv stimulates the production of more ECM proteins and mineralized matrix than Zim or glass in this osteoblast-like cell/implant culture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Antibiotic bonding was obtained by soaking the meshes for 15 min in a solution containing 20 mg ml(-1) rifampicin or 10 mg ml(-1) of vancomycin or gentamicin. A polymer mesh was implanted in a subcutaneous pouch in 16 rabbits: four received a rifampicin-soaked mesh, four received a vancomycin-soaked mesh, four received a gentamicin-soaked mesh, and four received an untreated mesh (control group). At the time of implantation, all the meshes were contaminated locally with 10(8) colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. Meshes were harvested one week later and submitted to bacterial counts. At the time of explantation, none of the antibiotic-soaked meshes were infected, whereas all the untreated meshes were infected. These results show that antibiotic soaking evidently prevents perioperative infection of gelatin-coated knitted polymer meshes in this model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The resulting polymers were random copolymers with weight average molecular weights from 40 000 to 200 000 dalton. Chemical structure and purity were confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectral analysis. General structure-property correlations were established. The glass transition temperature decreased with increasing PEG content and increasing pendent chain length. When higher molecular weight PEG blocks were used, the glass transition temperature increased relative to identical polymers having shorter PEG blocks. The tensile modulus increased with decreasing PEG content, decreasing pendent chain length, and when longer PEG blocks were used. Water uptake and the rate of backbone degradation increased with increasing PEG content. Microspheres could be prepared by solvent evaporation techniques from copolymers with low PEG content. Release rate of pNA and FITC-dextran from the microspheres increased with increasing PEG content. While tyrosine-derived polycarbonates were excellent substrates for cell attachment and growth, the presence of only 5 mol% of PEG(1000),, led to low or no cell attachment in short-term cell culture with both rat lung fibroblasts and osteoblasts. The polymers were non-cytotoxic. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Poly(DTE co 70%PEG(1000)( )carbonate) was chosen as an example to study this special phase transition behavior of the polymers. The observed transition temperature varied slightly depending on the technique used, e.g. CD always gave a lower temperature than UV/Vis. CD and UV/Vis studies indicated that the transition temperature was both heating rate and concentration dependent. Thermodynamic parameters of the transition (enthalpy, entropy, and free energy) were determined by DSC. The molecularity of the transition was 2.6, as calculated from UV and DSC data. The transition temperature could be varied from 18 to 58?C by changing the polymer structure.

Our study targeted the spreading behavior of human PMN adherent to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), pretreated with various plasma proteins, in response to the chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). To this end, a novel imaging configuration was developed to allow in situ reconstructive analysis of PMN 3-D morphology on opaque ePTFE surfaces, using optical sectioning confocal microscopy. Following fMLP stimulation, PMN morphological polarity was enhanced on all substrates studied except fibrinogen treated ePTFE. 3-D PMN morphometry revealed that in the absence of fMLP, overall cell spreading was minimized on albumin-treated ePTFE and maximized on fibrinogen and immunoglobulin-G-treated ePTFE. Following fMLP stimulation, overall PMN spreading increased markedly on untreated and albumin-coated ePTFE, while it stayed invariant on IgG and plasma treated ePTFE, and decreased on fibrinogen similar to treated ePTFE. Spatial analysis of PMN spreading following fMLP stimulation revealed enhanced PMN attachment on untreated and albumin treated ePTFE and diminished attachment on fibrinogen and plasma treated ePTFE. Thus, chemoattractant stimulation altered a wide range of PMN spreading attributes on ePTFE, including morphological polarity, substrate attachment, and 3-D membrane spreading, in a substrate dependent manner. These chemoattractant-induced spreading responses may also have important consequences for PMN phagocytosis. We report that fMLP stimulation led to enhanced unopsonized particulate phagocytosis on untreated and albumin treated ePTFE, but caused no discernible change in phagocytosis on other protein substrates. Thus, chemoattractant modulation of PMN spreading on ePTFE is highly substrate-regulated, and manifests in concerted effects on PMN phagocytosis. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We evaluated and compared the in vitro biocompatibility of silicone-based rubbers and propose them as an alternative to conventional products. We used the MTT colorimetric test to assess cell viability and flow cytometry to evaluate cell proliferation. Tests were conducted at 24 and 72 h. Changes in cell morphology were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Positive (polyurethane) and negative (polystyrene) toxicity controls were included. The number of viable cells was significantly higher on polystyrene than on polyurethane. A decrease in the total number of cells from 24 to 72 h compared to the negative control was correlated with a lower percentage of S-phase cells. The differences in cell viability noted between the samples and the polystyrene control mainly resulted from an initial lack of adhesion, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The biocompatibility of the three silicone rubbers was comparable to the best of the three products currently being used. These results, combined with those of the previous study, indicate that silicone rubber could be considered for the manufacture of mouth guards. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, both STM and AFM require physical contact to the specimen. In the case of STM, the specimen needs to be conducting as well. Here we introduce a new method for imaging biological materials through air or a suitable liquid using decaying or evanescent fields at the tip of a properly designed microwave resonator. This novel method involves the use of an evanescent microwave probe (EMP) and is capable of imaging a variety of non-uniformities in biological materials including conductivity, permittivity, and density variations. EMP is a non-contact and non-destructive sensor and it does not require conducting specimens. Its spatial resolution is currently around 0.4 mu m m at 1 GHz. We have used this probe to map non-uniformities in a variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and biological and botanical samples.

Each polypeptide chain of collagen is composed of repeats of the sequence: Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are often L-proline (Pro) and 4(R)-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) residues, respectively. These chains are wound into tight triple helices of great stability, The hydroxyl group of Hyp residues contributes much to this conformational stability. The existing paradigm is that this stability arises from interstrand hydrogen bonds mediated by bridging water molecules, This model was tested using chemical synthesis to replace Hyp residues with 4(R)-fluoro-L-proline (Flp) residues. The fluorine atom in Flp residues does not form hydrogen bonds but does elicit strong inductive effects, Results: Replacing the Hyp residues in collagen with Flp residues greatly increases triple-helical stability. The free energy contributed by the fluorine atom in Flp residues is twice that of the hydroxyl group in Hyp residues. The stability of the Flp-containing triple helix far exceeds that of any untemplated collagen mimic of similar size. Conclusions: Bridging water molecules contribute little to collagen stability. Rather, collagen stability relies on previously unappreciated inductive effects. Collagen mimics containing fluorine or other appropriate electron-withdrawing substituents could be the basis of new biomaterials for restorative therapies.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raines, RT (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Raines, Ronald/A-5009-2013","Raines, Ronald/0000-0001-7164-1719",NIAMS NIH HHS [AR44276],,,71,197,200,3,23,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",1074-5521,,,CHEM BIOL,Chem.

In this work we evaluated new bone regeneration in 10 patients using only a blood clot protected with titanium grids and non-resorbable membranes, without any filling material. A manual measurement of the size of the bone defect, using a plastic probe, was performed at 2 surgical steps. After 5 months of treatment, a biopsy was taken from each patient, fixed and embedded in PMMA, examined microradiographically and morphologically to evaluate the newly-formed bone. Our results showed a good repair of the defects by bone regeneration (about 85% overall), high mineral density of new bone around the implants after 5 months, and steady state deposition processes. These results in GBR, without filling material, appear very promising for implantology and reconstructive odontostomatology practice.","Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Umana & Ereditaria, Sez Anat Patol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; Studio Odontol Associato, Milan, Italy; Univ Modena, Dipartimento Sci Morfol & Med Legali, Sez Anat Umana, I-41100 Modena, Italy","Botticelli, AR (reprint author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Umana & Ereditaria, Sez Anat Patol, Via Forlanini 14, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",,"Zaffe, Davide/G-1181-2016","Zaffe, Davide/0000-0003-1241-385X",,,,28,17,18,0,1,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0905-7161,,,CLIN ORAL IMPLAN RES,Clin.

Design: Animal study. Setting: School of medicine, Spain. Material: 48 New Zealand white rabbits divided into 4 groups of 12 each. Interventions: Full thickness defects 50 x 70 mm were created in the abdominal wall and repaired with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Soft Tissue Patch(R)), one of two polypropylene patches (Marlex(R) and Prolene(R)), or lyophylised dura mater (LyoDura(R)). 3 animals from each group were killed at 14, 30, 60 and 90 days and specimens examined by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and immune histochemistry by labelling of macrophages with RAM-11, a specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Main outcome measures: Infection, healing, development of adhesions, and histological appearance of the interface. Results: Tissues responded similarly to materials of similar structures. Layered prostheses (PTFE and Lyo-Dura(R)) caused formation of a well organised neoperitoneum with few adhesions to the abdominal viscera (loose adhesions in. animals in each group), whereas the mesh prostheses generated a disorganised neoperitoneum with many adhesions (Marlex(R) loose adhesions 3, firm 8, and integrated 1; Prolene(R) loose adhesions 2, firm 8, and integrated 2). Lyo-Dura(R) was associated with the formation of areas of calcification. Labelling of macrophages with the MoAb showed that they were in direct contact with all materials studied. Conclusions: Layered biomaterials with Little or no porosity (PTFE and Lyo-Dura(R)) are the most suitable of the four for implantation in sites where the prosthesis is in contact with the visceral peritoneum, because they induce minimal adhesions.","Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Madrid 28871, Spain","Bellon, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Med, Dept Morphol Sci & Surg, Crta Madrid Barcelona,Km 33600, Madrid 28871, Spain.",,,"PASCUAL, GEMMA/0000-0002-1623-4384; BELLON, JUAN M./0000-0002-6071-5011; bujan, Julia/0000-0003-2419-2476",,,,19,31,33,0,2,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",1102-4151,,,EUR J SURG,Eur.

Analysis was carried out using on-line flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and off-line flash (vacuum) pyrolysis followed by GC/MS. Standard samples of hexoses, pentoses, deoxyhexoses, lactose, cellulose and starch were treated with 25% aqueous TMAH (100 times excess by weight). Approximately 50 mu g (for on-line analysis) or 250 mu g (for off-line analysis) of the carbohydrate/TMAH mixture was heated to 700 degrees C (10 s) using a quartz holder and a CDS pyroprobe, From electron and chemical impact mass spectral data, and, from literature on alkaline decomposition of carbohydrates, tentative structures of unique products and the mechanisms of their formation are proposed. A series of permethylated deoxy aldonic acids are tentatively identified as key products. It is postulated that these 'saccharinic acids' are initially formed from the action of alkali on reducing sugars which are then subsequently methylated. In addition, thermochemolytic analysis of lactose, cellulose and starch afforded their own unique permethylated deoxy aldonic acids as well producing methoxy benzene products, i.e. 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, 2,4-dimethoxyphenol. It is believed that glycosidically-linked saccharides initially degrade under alkaline conditions similar to the so-called 'peeling reaction' observed for cellulose under alkaline pulping conditions and then are finally methylated. An algal sample has been analyzed for its carbohydrate composition. The observation of hexose, pentose and polysaccharide thermochemolysis products illustrate the potential of the method to characterize the saccharide composition of more complex biomaterials.

Flow cell studies of the interaction between bacteria and surfaces do not generally allow direct comparison of different materials using the same bacterial suspension. The use of a modified Robbins Device (MRD) to compare the adhesion to different surfaces of Staph. epidermidis RP62A grown in continuous culture was investigated. Adhesion to glass was compared with siliconized glass, plasma-conditioned glass, titanium, stainless steel and Teflon. Attachment to siliconized glass was also compared with glass under differing ionic strength, and divalent cation concentrations. Both the differences in numbers adhering and changes in adhesion (slope) through the MRD were compared. There was a trend towards higher numbers adhering to the discs at the in-flow end of the MRD than at the outflow end, probably reflecting depletion of adherent bacteria in the interacting stream. Adhesion of Staph. epidermidis RP62A to siliconized glass and Teflon was reduced when compared to glass with increasing flow rates. Adhesion to stainless steel nias not affected by flow rate and titanium gave a different slope of adhesion through the MRD when compared with glass, suggesting an interaction with different sub-populations within the interacting stream. Differences between siliconized glass and glass at flow rates of 300 mi h(-1) were abolished by the addition of calcium or EDTA and reduced by the addition of magnesium. Increasing ionic strength reduced the statistical significance of the differences between glass and siliconized glass, Pre-conditioning of glass with pooled human plasma reduced adhesion compared with untreated glass and again gave a different slope to glass. The MRD linked to a chemostat call be used to compare directly bacterial adhesion to potential biomaterials. Variable depiction of the interacting stream should be taken into account in the interpretation of results. Divalent cation concentration, substrate properties and flow rate were important determinants of the comparative adhesion of Staph. epidermidiss RP62A to surfaces.","Univ Bristol, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England; Univ Bristol, Dept Paediat Epidemiol, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England","Millar, MR (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Royal Infirm, Dept Pathol & Microbiol, Level 8,Marlborough St, Bristol BS2 8HW, Avon, England.",,,"sherriff, andrea/0000-0002-1016-037X",,,,33,15,15,0,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-5072,,,J APPL MICROBIOL,J.

Microfabrication techniques have enabled the production of precisely controlled surface topographies that have been used as substrata for cells in culture and on devices implanted in vivo. This article reviews aspects of cell behavior involved in tissue response to implants with an emphasis on the effects of topography. Microfabricated grooved surfaces produce orientation and directed locomotion of epithelial cells in vitro and can inhibit epithelial downgrowth on implants. The effects depend on the groove dimensions and they are modified by epithelial cell-cell interactions. Fibroblasts similarly exhibit contact guidance on grooved surfaces, but fibroblast shape in vitro differs markedly from that found in vivo. Surface topography is important in establishing tissue organization adjacent to implants, with smooth surfaces generally being associated with fibrous tissue encapsulation. Grooved topographies appear to have promise in reducing encapsulation ii in the short term, but additional studies employing three-dimensional reconstruction and diverse topographies are needed to understand better the process of connective-tissue organization adjacent to implants. Microfabricated surfaces can increase the frequency of mineralized bone-like tissue nodules adjacent to subcutaneously implanted surfaces in rats. Orientation of these nodules with grooves occurs both in culture and on implants. Detailed comparisons of cell behavior on micromachined substrata in vitro and in vivo are difficult because of the number and complexity of factors, such as population density and micromotion, that cart differ between these conditions.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Med Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Brunette, DM (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Biol & Med Sci, 2199 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",,,,,,,62,250,251,5,46,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

In the present work, we have electrochemically synthesized composites comprising heparin and the electrically conducting polymer polypyrrole. The incorporation and exposure of heparin were controlled by varying key conditions of polymer synthesis (i.e., applied current and synthesis time). The resulting composite polymers were electroactive after synthesis and the amount of heparin exposed in the polymer could be increased (up to threefold) by switching the polymers from their oxidized to reduced states. Polymer reduction was achieved by either application of negative potentials (-0.4 to -0.7 V for 90 s) or exposure to aqueous reductant (0.1M sodium dithionite for 30 min). Heparin-polypyrrole composites remained stable after autoclaving, displaying no significant loss of electroactivity, and had a shelf life of at least 2 years postautoclaving. Finally, the composites were found to be excellent substrates for the growth of human endothelial cells.

Polystyrene was used as a model hydrophobic polymer; i.e., we expected that the role of fibrinogen in platelet adhesion to polystyrene would be representative of other hydrophobic polymers. Platelet adhesion was compared to both the amount and conformation of adsorbed fibrinogen. The strategy was to compare platelet adhesion to surfaces preadsorbed with normal, afibrinogenemic, and fibrinogen-replenished afibrinogenemic plasmas. Platelet adhesion was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) method, which was found to be closely correlated with adhesion of In-111-labeled platelets. Fibrinogen adsorption from afibrinogenemic plasma to polystyrene (Immulon I(R)) was low and <10 ng/cm(2). Platelet adhesion was absent on surfaces preadsorbed with afibrinogenemic plasma when the residual fibrinogen was low enough (<60 mu g/mL). Platelet adhesion was restored on polystyrene preadsorbed with fibrinogen-replenished afibrinogenemic plasma. Addition of even small, subnormal concentrations of fibrinogen to afibrinogenemic plasma greatly increased platelet adhesion. In addition, surface-bound fibrinogen's ability to mediate platelet adhesion was different, depending on the plasma concentration from which fibrinogen was adsorbed. These differences correlated with changes in the binding of a monoclonal antibody that binds to the A alpha chain RGDS (572-575), suggesting alteration in the conformation or orientation of the adsorbed fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion to polystyrene preadsorbed with blood plasma thus appears to be a strongly bivariate function of adsorbed fibrinogen, responsive to both low amounts and altered states of the adsorbed molecule.

To explore the in vitro effects of surface immobilized PEO on the human inflammatory cells, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), we developed a diisocyanate-based method for coupling PEG to amine-modified glass, a surface previously shown to enhance macrophage adhesion and FBGC formation. Contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of PEG molecules bound to the surface and revealed that PEG molecular weight significantly influenced the efficiency of PEO coupling. We used a 10-day human monocyte culture protocol to demonstrate that the presence of surface coupled PEG molecules does not significantly decrease initial monocyte density or monocyte-derived macrophage density after 3 days. However, PEG-coupled surfaces significantly reduced long-term monocyte-derived macrophage density and virtually eliminated interleukin-4-induced FBGC formation observed at day 10. The cellular response to these PEG-coupled surfaces was related to the molecular weight of the PEG chains, which was varied between 200 Da and 18.5 kDa. These results suggest that an optimized PEG surface treatment may be effective in reducing inflammatory cell adhesion and possible degradation during the inflammatory response to an implanted biomedical device.

The PLLA composite with modulus of elasticity of >5 GPa similar to that of natural bone was found to be prepared when the fiber content was over 35 wt. %, The bending test of the composites showed that very high energy is consumed for their fracture and that the fracture proceeds step by step, even beyond the maximum stress.","Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan","Kasuga, T (reprint author), Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan.",,,,,,,20,18,20,0,4,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DR, WARRENDALE, PA 15086 USA",0884-2914,,,J MATER RES,J.

The KTA-based template induces a significant gain in free energy and reduces the critical chain length for triple helix formation over the acyl terminated single chain structures. Our approach also includes the incorporation of the peptoid residue N-isobutylglycine into the design for novel collagen-like sequences. We have synthesized and characterized acetylated single chain and template-assembled analogs composed of Gly-Pro-Nleu and GIy-Nleu-Pro sequences. The achiral trimeric unit Gly-Nleu-Nleu was included as a guest sequence in a host structure such as Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-NleuNleu)(3)-(GIy-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 which retains triple helicity. A series of guest-host collagen mimetics composed of Gly-Nleu-Pro sequences as the host were synthesized and assessed for triple helicity. Guest sequences include Gly-Nleu-Nleu and Gly-Nx-Pro units, where Nx is the guest peptoid residue with alkyl and aralkyl side chains. We have continued to investigate functionalized template motifs and sequence variations.

Ion-beam-based processes, such as ion implantation and ion-beam assisted deposition (IBAD) can provide beneficial surface layers with desirable properties without detrimentally affecting the bulk properties. Ion implantation has been successful in biomaterials modification, such as in improving the wear resistance of artificial joint components, in improving wettability, anticoagulability, anticalcific behavior of biomedical polymers, and in minimizing biofouling of medical devices, etc. IBAD has been used to prepare hydroxyapatite coatings with high adhesive strength on substrates of several implant materials. Biocompatible diamond-like carbon coatings and C-N films, antibacterial coatings and sealant coatings have also been produced by this technique. This paper reviews the present status of applications of the ion-beam process in modifying the surface of biomaterials, as well as the effects induced by ion-beam irradiation to crop seeds, cells and microbes.

Biofilm formation and subsequent deterioration of the silicone material of the prosthesis often limit the mean life of the device to an average of 3-5 months. Although device replacement can be considered an easy outpatient procedure. frequent replacements are inconvenient for the patient and may lead to malfunction of the tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Further understanding of the process of development and inhibition of the colonization of these polymer surfaces requires several comprehensive clinical studies. How ever, iii vivo research of the biomaterials of the voice prostheses is difficult and time consuming. In order to simulate the natural process of biofilm development under dynamic nutrient conditions, an artificial throat was developed. Biofilm developed on Groningen(R) button voice prostheses iii vitro a could not be distinguished from that formed over several months in,vitro.

For example, the freezing of an aqueous solution within a hydrophobic liquid gives a basic model for the freezing of biomaterials. Furthermore, the melting of an ice layer has close relations to cold thermal storage using ice. In the present study, both perfluolocarbon (PFC) and silicon oil were adopted as the testing liquids. The ambient liquid temperatures ranged from 5 to 40 degrees C. The inclination angle of the ice plate was varied from 0 to 180 degrees at 30 degrees steps. The experimental results revealed that the inclination angle of the ice layer has a vital effect on the melting heat-transfer characteristics of the ice.","Hokkaido Univ, Div Mech Sci, Grad Sch Engn, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan","Yamada, M (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Div Mech Sci, Grad Sch Engn, N13-W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan.",,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0075-8450,,3-540-66333-9,LECT NOTES PHYS,,,1999.0,533,,,,,,159,168,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Mechanical; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Physics,BQ13R,WOS:000087263600014,,,,,2019-02-25

Previous studies from our laboratory have reported the tumorigenic potentials of these PUs in vivo and in vitro. PU-components had inhibited the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in cultures of mouse Balb/c (A31-1-1) and chinese hamster V79 fibroblasts. Since GJIC is crucial for normal differentiation of a cell population, this perturbed gap junction is most likely to play the major role in the PU-induced tumorigenesis. Gap junctions are composed of a multigene family of proteins called connexins. Various tumor promoters have been shown to inhibit GJIC by phosphorylation modification of connexin proteins. Mutations in connexin genes have also been found to lead abnormally regulated cell-cell communication. We are interested to elucidate the mecahnism of tumorigenesis induced by biomaterials including PUs. Ln the present study, we choose three PU-induced tumor clones, namely clone-2, 5 and 6, isolated from A31-1-1 cells, for investigation of mutation in their cx43 gene, the major gap junction protein of this cell line. The connexin43 (cx43) gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The entire coding region located in the exon 2 of ex 43 gene was sequenced directly from the PCR amplified product. None of the clones showed a difference in their cx43 sequences with the published sequence for mouse cx43 sequence. Thus, probably a post-translational modification or a defect in gene expression, but, not a mutation in the coding sequence of cx43, is involved in the polyurethane-induced inhibition of GJIC during the tumorigenesis in vitro.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Devices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1588501, Japan.",,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-5805-8,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,181,185,,,,,,5,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Cell Biology,BP18F,WOS:000084339700033,,,,,2019-02-25

Current treatments, although fairly successful, do not provide the optimum therapy. These treatments typically rely on donor tissues obtained either from the patient or from another source. The former raises the issue of supply, whereas the latter poses the risk of rejection and disease transfer. This has prompted orthopedic surgeons and scientists to look for viable alternatives. In recent years, tissue engineering has gained increasing support as a method to treat orthopedic disorders. Because it uses principles of engineering, biology, and chemistry, tissue engineering may provide a more effective approach to the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders than traditional methods. This chapter presents a review of current methods and new tissue-engineering techniques for the treatment of disorders affecting bone, ligament, and cartilage.","Drexel Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Adv Biomat & Tissue Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Laurencin, CT (reprint author), Drexel Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Adv Biomat & Tissue Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",Laurencin@drexel.edu,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771",NIAMS NIH HHS [AR46117]; NIGMS NIH HHS [5 F31 GM18905-02],,,96,540,560,4,109,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1523-9829,1545-4274,,ANNU REV BIOMED ENG,Annu.

Bubble collapse in liquids results in an enormous concentration of energy from the conversion of the kinetic energy of the liquid motion into heating of the contents of the bubble. The high local temperatures and pressures, combined with extraordinarily rapid cooling, provide a unique means for driving chemical reactions under extreme conditions. A diverse set of applications of ultrasound to enhance chemical reactivity has been explored with important uses in synthetic materials chemistry. For example, the sonochemical decomposition of volatile organometallic precursors in low-volatility solvents produces nanostructured materials in various forms with high catalytic activities. Nanostructured metals, alloys, oxides, carbides and sulfides, nanometer colloids, and nanostructured supported catalysts can all be prepared by this general route. Another important application of sonochemistry in materials chemistry has been the preparation of biomaterials, most notably protein microspheres. Such microspheres have a wide range of biomedical applications, including their use in echo contrast agents for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, contrast enhancement, and oxygen or drug delivery. Other applications include the modification of polymers and polymer surfaces.","Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Bath, Dept Chem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ksuslick@uiuc.edu; chsgjp@bath.ac.uk,"Price, Gareth/B-5293-2011; Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011","Price, Gareth/0000-0003-4983-5722; Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701",,,,143,1103,1133,31,461,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0084-6600,,,ANNU REV MATER SCI,Annu.

To this end, type I collagen coatings containing a model biomolecule, lysozyme, were deposited on Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V. Two deposition methods were examined. In the first, lysozyme was deposited concurrently with collagen, while in the second, protein was impregnated into previously deposited collagen coatings. The amount of collagen and the amount of lysozyme loaded into collagen were varied to provide different amounts of weakly and strongly bound protein. Release and retention of lysozyme were monitored over a 7 d period of incubation in physiological saline. For both methods, larger amounts of collagen in the coatings allowed incorporation of more lysozyme. Additionally, loading collagen coatings with greater amounts of lysozyme resulted in release of more protein. During the first 24-96 h of incubation, loosely bound protein was eluted, resulting in release of 2 mu g to 55 mg (5-75% of the amount available) of enzymatically active lysozyme. This left 25-95% of the protein bound to the collagen-coated biomaterials and, thus, available for later release during degradation of the collagen.","Univ Kentucky, Ctr Biomed Engn, Wenner Gren Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Puleo, DA (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Ctr Biomed Engn, Wenner Gren Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",,,,,,,9,9,10,0,2,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",1073-1199,,,ARTIF CELL BLOOD SUB,Artif.

Human bone marrow cell culture has certain advantages over other cell culture models, as its results show a greater conformity with animal experimental results and clinical studies. Primary cell adherence, cell number, cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix, cell viability and cell differentiation were used as indicative parameters of biocompatibility. After 2 weeks in culture, differences could be observed between the biomaterials with respect to these parameters. Cell numbers were greatest on the hydroxyapatite ceramic specimens, but were decreased on the titanium alloy specimens. Extracellular matrix hydroxyapatite production was high for ceramics, but reduced for titanium specimens. The polymers allowed only a few cells to adhere, and there were no signs of extracellular matrix production. The influence of biomaterials on differentiation of large numbers of cells was analysed by using flow cytophotometry. There were similar populations of T cells and monocytes on all specimens.

Our studies have established that heterogeneous mimetic peptide surfaces (MPS) containing both the -RGD- (cell-binding) and FHRRIKA- (putative heparin-binding) peptides, unique to BSP, in the ratio of 75:25 (MPS II) or 50:50 (RIPS LII) proved to be more biologically relevant and specific for RCO cell function. The initial response of human osteoblast-like cells to these surfaces was mediated by the collagen (alpha(2)beta(1)) and vitronectin receptors (alpha(v)beta(3)), whereas the vitronectin receptor alone dominated longer-term events (> 30 min). MPS II and III surfaces enhanced cell spreading and longterm events such as mineralization of the extracellular matrix compared to homogenous peptide surfaces and controls. Furthermore, extensive mineralization of the ECM deposited by RCOs occurred when the peptide was coupled to an interfacial interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) that resisted protein deposition (i.e., non-specific adsorption) and fouling, Work on thermo-reversible P(NIPAAm-co-AAc) hydrogels demonstrated the ability to create materials that can be delivered to the body in a minimally invasive manner and support tissue regeneration. These hydrogels can be modified to incorporate biofunctional components such as the biomimetic peptides, theoretically enhancing their ability to foster tissue regeneration. These results suggest that biomaterials can be engineered to mimic ECM components of bone (e.g., various organs) by grafting peptides in the appropriate ratios of the cell and heparin-binding domains, and ultimately modulate the expression of the osteoblast cell phenotype, Approaches similar to the one presented in this work can be used to design materials for hybrid artificial organs and other tissues.","Northwestern Univ, Div Biol Mat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; Robert R McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60201 USA","Healy, KE (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Div Biol Mat, 311 E Chicago Ave,Ward Bldg 10-116, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR43187]; NIDCR NIH HHS [T32 DE07042],,,31,130,141,1,29,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-194-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,1999.0,875,,,,,,24,35,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08491.x,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Transplantation",Engineering; Materials Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Transplantation,BN31W,WOS:000081586000003,10415555.0,,,,2019-02-25

The research on the use of zirconia ceramics as biomaterials started about twenty years ago, and now zirconia (Y-YZP) is in clinical use in THR, but developments are in progress for application in other medical devices. Recent developments have concentrated on the chemistry of precursors, in forming and sintering processes, and on surface finish of components. Today's main applications of zirconia ceramics is in THR ball heads. This review takes into account the main results achieved up to now, and is focused on the role that microstructural characteristics play on the TZP ceramics behaviour in ball heads, namely mechanical properties and their stability, wear of the UHMWPE paired to TZP, and their influence on biocompatibility.

Alginates possess many favorable properties required in biomaterials, but are unable to specifically interact with mammalian cells. We have therefore covalently modified alginate polysaccharides with RGD-containing cell adhesion ligands utilizing aqueous carbodiimide chemistry. The chemistry has been optimized and quantified with reaction efficiencies reaching 80% or greater. The concentration of peptide available for reaction was then varied to create hydrogels with a range of ligand densities. Mouse skeletal myoblasts were cultured on alginate hydrogel surfaces coupled with GRGDY peptides to illustrate achievement of cellular interaction with the otherwise non-adhesive hydrogel substrate. Myoblasts adhere to GRGDY-modified alginate surfaces, proliferate, fuse into multinucleated myofibrils, and express heavy-chain myosin which is a differentiation marker for skeletal muscle. Myoblast adhesion and spreading on these GRGDY-modified hydrogels was inhibited with soluble ligand added to the seeding medium, illustrating the specificity of adhesion to these materials. Alginate may prove to be an ideal material with which to confer specific cellular interactive properties, potentially allowing for the control of long-term gene expression of cells within these matrices.

Polyethylene-glycol-diisocyanate (PEG-diisocyanate, 3400 MW) may potentially react with protein amines to form molecular barriers on adsorbed proteins on biomaterials, thereby masking adhesive ligands and preventing acute surface thrombosis. To test this notion, PE, PTFE, and glass microconduits were pre-adsorbed with fibrinogen and treated with PEG-diisocyanate, non-reactive PEG-dihydroxyl, or remained untreated. Following perfusion of In-111-labeled platelets in whole human blood for 1 min (wall shear rate = 312 s(-1)), PEG-diisocyanate treated surfaces experienced 96% (PE), 97% (PTFE) and 94% (glass) less platelet deposition than untreated surfaces. Similar reductions were seen for PEG-diisocyanate versus PEG-dihydroxyl treatment. Low shear perfusions of plasma for one hour prior to blood contact did not reduce the inhibitory effect of PEG-diisocyanate. Platelet adhesion onto collagen coated glass coverslips and platelet deposition onto preclotted Dacron was also reduced by treatment with PEG-diisocyanate (93 and 91 %, respectively). Protein-reactive PEG may thus have utility in forming molecular barriers on surface associated proteins to inhibit acute thrombosis on cardiovascular biomaterials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Crosslinking of cruciate samples was carried out with: (i) no applied load, (ii) an initial 25 g (similar to 30 kPa) equibiaxial load, or (iii) an initial 200 g (similar to 250 kPa) equibiaxial load. All loading during crosslinking was done under a defined initial equibiaxial load and subsequently fixed biaxial strain. Load changes during crosslinking were monitored. Mechanical testing and constraint during crosslinking were carried out in a custom-built biaxial servo-hydraulic testing system incorporating four actuators with phase-controlled waveform synthesis, high frame-rate video dimension analysis, and computer-interfaced data acquisition The paired biaxial stress-strain responses under equibiaxial loading at 1 Hz (before and after treatment) were evaluated for changes in anisotropic extensibility by calculation of an anisotropy index. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on freeze-fractured samples to relate collagen crimp morphology to constraint during crosslinking. Fresh tissue was markedly anisotropic with the base-to-apex direction of the pericardium being less extensible and stiffer than the circumferential direction. After unconstrained crosslinking, the extensibility in the circumferential direction, the stiffness in the base-to-apex direction, and the tissue's anisotropy were all reduced. Anisotropy was preserved in the tissue treated with an applied 25 g load; however, tissue treated with an applied 200 g load became extremely stiff and nearly isotropic. SEM micrographs correlated well with observed extensibility in that the collagen fibre morphology changed from very crimped (unconstrained crosslinking), to straight (200 g applied load). Biaxial stress-fixation may allow engineering of bioprosthetic materials for specific medical applications. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The improvement in the interface compatibility of polymers selected for implantation by directed surface modification is an important contribution to biomaterial development. Different polymer properties are adjusted and characterized independently of the carrier polymer by means of introduction of modern surface analytical methods and surface techniques. In addition, the interactions between the modified polymer surface and the biological system are measured. In this way, the hydrophilization of a polyurethane (Tecolex(TM)) and a poly(ether sulfone) by plasma induced graftcopolymerization of hydrogels like poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) leads to improved blood compatibility. Functionalization by means of SO2 plasma treatment of medical grade poly(vinyl chloride) increases the adsorption of the basal membrane protein fibronectin, which correlates with an improvement in cell growth. A suitable interface for an improved cell growth of hum an vascular endothelial cells as well as for cornea endothelial cells has been created by immobilization of the cell adhesion mediator fibronectin using bifunctional spacer molecules at several carrier polymer surfaces like smooth poly(vinyl chloride), modified polyurethane, Tecoflex(TM) and poly(dimethyl siloxane).","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Text Chem & Macromol Chem, D-52062 Aachen, Germany","Klee, D (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Text Chem & Macromol Chem, Veltmanpl 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",klee@dwi.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,153,111,113,2,59,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-3195,,3-540-65933-1,ADV POLYM SCI,Adv.

The binding of thrombin to immobilized fibrinogen was mostly reversible, the bound thrombin could be inhibited by milimolar concentration of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF). at least three sets of different thrombin binding sites were found. There was a residual fraction of thrombin bound to washed fibrin(ogen) (to about a five to ten percent of fibrin monomer units) suggesting that a known naturally occurring fibrinogen variant differing in the gamma chain was the target. Surface bound fibrinogen was converted by thrombin to fibrin monomer that interacted with fibrinogen in solution.

Starting with surface-bound fibrinogen and alternating addition of thrombin and fibrinogen a fibrin network of predetermined composition, size, and arrangement could be formed.","Inst Hematol & Blood Transfus, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic","Dyr, JE (reprint author), Inst Hematol & Blood Transfus, U Nemocnice 1, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",,"Dyr, Jan/G-5580-2017; Homola, Jiri/F-3683-2014; Slavik, Radan/G-3164-2012; Slavik, Radan/A-4300-2015","Dyr, Jan/0000-0002-7970-5868; Homola, Jiri/0000-0001-6258-015X; ",,,,17,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3032-3,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3570,,,,,,176,183,,10.1117/12.336928,,,,8,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical; Microbiology; Optics",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Microbiology; Optics,BM45P,WOS:000078785700022,,,,,2019-02-25

In this paper, we will expand on the use of wheat gluten films as active layers, i.e. when the film contribute by itself to the food preservation. Some potential uses of these biomaterials (e.g. modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables, slow release of food preservatives) are described with examples. The development of biopackaging or edible films with selective gas permeability is very promising for controlling respiratory exchange and improving the conservation of fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. Wheat gluten films appear to have suitable O-2 barrier properties while remaining relatively permeable to CO2. The gas permeability's of gluten based films were measured at various temperatures and relative humidites. O-2/CO2 selectivity increased from 3 (at 4 degrees C and low RH) to more than 45 (at 40 degrees c and 95%RH). Some selective gluten-based films have been shown to lead to the creation of very original atmospheres when used to wrap fresh mushrooms. The modified atmosphere rise to an equilibrium composition of 2-3% CO2 and 2-3% O-2 which is favourable to the mushroom overall quality. The diffusion of sorbic acid in various wheat gluten film was studied and the release from the film to a model food was measured and modelled, The anti-microbial effect of various edible gluten I sorbic acid based films was evaluated against Penicillium notatum. Simple gluten-based films had no own fungicidal effect but the gluten I lipid based films showed a strong sorbic acid retention and a marked own fungicidal effect, either at 30 degrees C or 4 degrees C, delaying the Penicillium notatum growth for more then 21 days.","INRA, ENSAM, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France","Guilbert, S (reprint author), INRA, ENSAM, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INST NATL RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE,PARIS,"147 RUE DE L'UNIVERSITE, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0293-1915,,2-7380-0874-7,COLLOQ INRA,,,1999.0,,91,,,,,315,320,,,,,,6,"Agronomy; Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology",Agriculture; Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,BN59S,WOS:000082330400041,,,,,2019-02-25

The fact that these diseases have an increased incidence in uremia, and particularly in dialysis patients, suggests an increased exposure to oxidative stress in this condition. In haemodialysis (HD), the absence of a complete correction of the uremic toxicity together with the untoward effects of the dialysis, malnutrition and the progressive worsening of the clinical condition, can lead to a high susceptibility to oxidative stress by an abnormal production of oxidants - including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and uremic toxins with prooxidant function - and defective antioxidant protection. One of the most investigated biological effects of the oxidative stress in the HD patients is lipid peroxidation in plasma and blood cell membranes. Moreover, we have recently described how abnormal apoptosis in peripheral blood leukocytes is associated with cell oxidative stress (intracellular thiol depletion). Vitamin E, in both in vitro and in vivo conditions, has been proposed to partially correct these effects. in this review we evaluated some features of two new dialysis strategies using an antioxidant approach to the protection against the oxidant stress in HD. Their rationale is based on the emerging role of vitamin E in counteracting some biological effects associated with oxidant stress namely lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. These techniques use: 1) the recirculation of the dialysate through a suspension of vitamin E-enriched liposomes combined with the supplementation by the dialysate with ascorbic acid, this method has been called hemolipodialysis; 2) the coating of the dialysis membrane with vitamin E (vitamin E-modified dialysis membranes). These unconventional approaches to the antioxidant therapy in HD open a widely unexplored and promising field in the evolution of the biomaterials and dialysis quality.","Univ Urbino, G Fornaini Inst Biol Chem, I-61029 Urbino, PS, Italy","Galli, F (reprint author), Univ Urbino, G Fornaini Inst Biol Chem, Via Saffi 2, I-61029 Urbino, PS, Italy.",,"Galli, Francesco/K-5048-2016","Galli, Francesco/0000-0003-3626-051X",,,,71,54,55,0,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0253-5068,,,BLOOD PURIFICAT,Blood Purif.,,1999.0,17,2-3,,,,,79,94,,10.1159/000014379,,,,16,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,229RQ,WOS:000082208700004,10449865.0,,,,2019-02-25

From the original description of continuous arterio-venous haemofiltration, new techniques such as continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration and high flux dialysis have been developed and clinically utilised. A parallel improvement in efficiency has been achieved with urea daily clearances as high as 50 litres or more. The use of special highly permeable dialysers has also permitted to increase the clearances of larger solutes thus leading to significant removals of chemical substances involved in the acute inflammation and sepsis. In this field, recent observations have suggested to use haemofiltration with high volumes of fluid exchange. The hardware and software of the newer continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) are certainly the key point in achieving these results and in safely performing such challenging techniques.","St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy","Ronco, C (reprint author), St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,31,11,11,1,2,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0253-5068,,,BLOOD PURIFICAT,Blood Purif.,,1999.0,17,2-3,,,,,166,172,,10.1159/000014389,,,,7,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,Hematology; Urology & Nephrology,229RQ,WOS:000082208700014,10449875.0,,,,2019-02-25

Images of internal strain or displacement may provide valuable information about pathological processes such as edema and fibrosis which are known to alter the mechanical properties of tissue. In this study we developed experimental methods for measuring internal deformation in highly scattering tissue with OCT and applied them to tissue phantoms and living tissue. Piezoelectric actuators were configured to compress the samples in steps of 5-10 mu m as images were captured synchronously using either a frame or a line-by-line acquisition mode. The displacements of structures inside the samples were quantified using speckle-tracking algorithms based on cross correlation or optical flow of selected features. Displacements as small as a few micrometers were measurable in heterogeneous gelatin phantoms containing scattering particles and living skin. The results suggest that the composition of tissues layers whose elasticities differ greatly (e.g., fat and muscle) can be deduced visually from image sequences without the need for complicated image processing. However, better models are needed to transform the displacement images into quantitative maps of subtle regional variations of the elastic modulus.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Schmitt, JM (reprint author), Nellcor Puritan Bennett Corp, 4280 Hacienda Dr, Pleasanton, CA 94588 USA.",,,,,,,8,5,5,1,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3068-4,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3598,,,,,,47,55,,10.1117/12.347506,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics",Engineering; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics,BN09M,WOS:000080656800006,,,,,2019-02-25

Sucrose systems showed, by far, the fastest colour development, particularly in the presence of lysine and glycine as sources of amino groups. The results confirm the extraordinary stability of trehalose.

Results were related with conventional blood compatibility measurements: albumin adsorption, fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. While contact angle measurements with water are material-related but constant in time, contact angle measurements with plasma changed over time owing to protein adsorption on the solid-liquid interface. The contact medium plasma did not influence the initial contact angle. Contact angles on PDMS decreased most in time (41 degrees) and demonstrated highest levels of conventionally measured albumin and fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. PTFE, with the lowest contact angle decrease over a 500 minutes period (19 degrees), showed low fibrinogen and albumin adsorption as well as low platelet adhesion. PU and HDPE demonstrated almost similar initial contact angles with plasma and contact angle decreases (26 and 27 degrees), intermediate protein adsorption, and platelet adhesion. We conclude that biocompatibility properties of the tested materials may be more related to the behaviour of their contact angles in time, than to the initial hydrophobic or hydrophilic state.","Univ Groningen, Inst Biomed Mat Sci & Applicatio, Div Artificial Organs, Groningen, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Dept Cardiol & Thorac Surg, Groningen, Netherlands","Rakhorst, G (reprint author), Fac Med, BMSA, Div Artificial Organs, Bloemsingel 10, NL-9712 KZ Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,11,5,5,2,21,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The quality and quantity of the coating is sensitive to application techniques, metal substrate, and manufacturing controls-all important in creating a clinically successful coating. Bioactive coatings other than hydroxyapatite have had mixed success and are generally not available for clinical use at this time. Clinical experience with hydroxyapatite-coated hip implants have focused on the femoral component, where results approach the standard of cemented components. Acetabular components have been less impressive when hydroxyapatite is the primary source of fixation without macrostructured substrate or augmentation with screws. Analysis of sequential follow-up radiographs in patients with hydroxyapatite-coated hips consistently reveals the changes associated with prompt and tenacious biologic fixation of the femoral component. These changes are apparent at 6 months and persist beyond 8 years. While the optimal design of the components, the surface structure of the metal substrate, and the ideal application method are still evolving. the use of hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses for hip arthroplasty has been proven safe and successful for clinical use where biologically fixed components are indicated.","NYU, Med Ctr, Hosp Joint Dis Orthopaed Inst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, New York, NY 10003 USA","Jaffe, WL (reprint author), NYU, Med Ctr, Hosp Joint Dis Orthopaed Inst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 301 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,203,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,4-431-70241-5,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,159,187,,,,,,29,"Materials Science, Biomaterials; Orthopedics; Surgery",Materials Science; Orthopedics; Surgery,BP76Y,WOS:000086113200016,,,,,2019-02-25

These consisted of unfunctionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blended with small percentages of either ethylene oxide (EO)- or phosphorylcholine (PC) ester-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes to increase surface hydrophilicity. The latter was formed by the hydrosilation of a dimethylsilane-terminated polydimethylsiloxane with omega-vinylphosphorylcholine ester. The ester was synthesized from 9-hydroxy-1-decene and 2-chlorotrimethylamine incorporating the phosphoryl functionality. The blends were cast from a dilute solution of chloroform onto low-density polyethylene (LDPE). A comparison of methods to implement the underwater captive bubble (UWCB) technique, the curved UWCB technique or the modified UWCB technique, a convenient method for determining theta(AW) on curved surfaces, demonstrated that both methods were accurate and precise. As the percentage of functionalized polydimethylsiloxane in a family of blends increased, theta(AW) decreased. The theta(AW) value on the EO-siloxane blends was nonetheless typically 30 degrees less than that on the PC-siloxane blends. The values of theta(AW) on blends determined with the modified UWCB technique demonstrated that too little functionalized polydimethylsiloxane was present to produce a hydrophilic surface promising hemocompatibility.","Howard Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA; Howard Univ, Dept Chem, Washington, DC 20059 USA","Collins, WE (reprint author), Howard Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",,,,,,,27,1,1,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0169-4243,,,J ADHES SCI TECHNOL,J.

We now report the polymerization of a phospholipid monolayer assembly onto an alkylated hydrogel substrate with significant alteration in both surface chemistry and mass transport properties at the hydrogel-water interface. A general platform is thereby created for enhancing the control of either the local delivery of specific macromolecules or the immunoisolation barrier for many cell based therapies.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Lab Biomol Mat Res, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Atlanta, GA 30320 USA","Chaikof, EL (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Lab Biomol Mat Res, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",echaikof@surgery.eushc.org,,"Marra, Kacey/0000-0002-8437-4864",NHLBI NIH HHS [HL56819],,,38,12,12,0,4,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Polymer networks were synthesised from the PFPE macromonomers of increasing chain length and the adhesion and proliferation of corneal, vascular and bone cells was evaluated on these polymers. The polymer surfaces were quite hydrophobic, having sessile air-water contact angles ranging between 96 and 125 degrees. However, these polymers supported the attachment and growth of bovine corneal epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts at 60-100% of the rate of cell growth on the culture substratum, TCPS. Furthermore, the PFPE polymers supported the attachment and growth of vascular endothelial cells (from human umbilical artery) and human bone-derived cells over a 7 day period at an equal level to TCPS. The relationship between the macromonomer chain length (n = 1 to 4) and the ability of the resulting PFPE homopolymer to support the overgrowth of corneal epithelial tissue was also evaluated. The PFPE-containing polymers supported corneal epithelial tissue overgrowth, with the most effective having a performance equivalent to that of TCPS. Tn addition to these homopolymers, copolymers comprising of PFPE and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) were also synthesised. Surprisingly, the addition of DMAEMA to the PFPE polymer network lead to a reduction in the growth and attachment of corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts. These results indicate that PFPE-based materials show a potential for use in the development of biomaterials in the ocular, vascular and orthopaedic areas.","Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; CSIRO, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; CSIRO, Clayton S MDC, Vic 3169, Australia","Steele, JG (reprint author), Cooperat Res Ctr Eye Res & Technol, POB 184, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia.",jack.steele@riverside.molsci.csiro.au,,"Laycock, Bronwyn/0000-0002-0251-844X",,,,31,15,15,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

After eight weeks the implants and surrounding tissue were removed for histological evaluation. In all scoring categories (i.e. collagen thickness, fibrous tissue orientation, collagen deposition in muscle tissue, lymphocyte infiltration, angiogenesis) the PIB/PDMS bicomponent network implants elicited either less or similar tissue and cellular response than polyethylene. To determine which implant elicited the least tissue and cellular response overall, a weighted score including collagen thickness, lymphocyte infiltration, and angiogenesis was calculated for each implant. According to these preliminary investigations.

However the tissue response associated with this and other polymer implants continues to limit any long-term function. One of the major approaches currently being investigated to improve biocompatibility involves surface modification of the base polymer. In this report, we attempted to alter the healing characteristics of ePTFE by denucleation, a process which removes air trapped within the interstices of the material. Additionally, adsorption of extracellular proteins on the denucleated polymer was also tested. After 5 weeks implanted in subcutaneous and epididymal fat sites of rats, the material was explanted and the healing around the implant evaluated histologically. We found that in skin implants, denucleation alone resulted in a substantial reduction in the fibrous capsule which has been previously reported for untreated ePTFE, and an increase in blood vessel development around and within the polymer. Absorption of extracellular matrix proteins prior to implantation resulted in a reduced vascularity of the implants compared with denucleation-only implants. Implants in fat tissue, regardless of treatment, showed very little tissue reaction, either in the number of inflammatory cells, development of a fibrous capsule or neovascularization. These results suggest that the presence of air nuclei within porous material may contribute to the inappropriate healing response associated with these polymers. In addition, they confirm earlier reports that healing around implanted polymers is tissue-specific.","Arizona Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Surg Res, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA","Boswell, CA (reprint author), Arizona Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Surg Res, POB 245084, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",,,,,,,18,11,11,0,1,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

According to two-dimensional NMR, the backbone structure of this polymer was as expected and contained no byproducts formed by acid catalyzed addition across the fumarate double bond. Kinetic studies of the transesterification showed that the molecular weight reached a final M-n of 4900 (+/-700) and M-w of 9100 (+/-1300) after 16 h, while the polydispersity index remained below 1.8 throughout the reaction.

PHO-cast films were sterilized by either ethylene oxide (EO) gas at 38 degrees C or gamma radiation (2.5 Mrad) in air at room temperature. The physical characteristics of the EO and gamma-sterilized PHO were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile strength analyses. In addition, various analytical methods were used to detect modifications in the chemical and morphological structure of PHO, namely, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The results show that EO sterilization did not modify the chemical and physical characteristics of PHO, however, significant modifications in both the structural and tensile properties were observed with gamma-sterilized PHO. These changes accounted for decreases in both the weight average, number average and melting temperature, and increases in the heat of fusion and tensile strength. No residual EO was detected following sterilization as revealed by head-space chromatography. The physical and structural properties of PHO were shown to be well preserved following EO sterilization, whereas gamma radiation caused random chain scission and physical cross-linking, a frequent phenomenon observed with organic polymers.","Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Montpellier I, Fac Pharm, CRBA, CNRS,URA 1465, Montpellier, France; CHUQ, Ctr Rech, Biomat Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Zhang, Ze/A-7902-2008","Zhang, Ze/0000-0003-4331-2058",,,,28,9,9,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Solution-cast PHO films were incubated in a citrate buffer solution with and without acid phosphatase and in an acetate buffer with and without beta-glucuronidase for periods ranging from 7 to GO days. The physical characterization of the PHO films was analyzed by SEM and tensile strength studies. In addition. various analytical methods were used to detect modifications in the chemical and morphological structure of the PHO, namely, ESCA, FTIR, DSC, X-ray diffraction, and SEC. The results indicate that the enzymatic conditions selected in the present study induced no significant surface morphological or chemical modifications, and no significant weight loss was observed after 60 days of incubation. However, as revealed by weight average molecular weight (M) over bar(w) and number average molecular weight (M) over bar(n) decreases, changes in the bulk structure of the PHO were observed with acid phosphatase at 28 and 60 days, in contrast to smaller (M) over bar(w) and (M) over bar(n) decreases recorded in both the buffers and the beta-glucuronidase. The tensile properties had decreased following incubation, yet showed no difference under all of the selected conditions. With no weight loss or surface changes, the PHO films incubated in acid phosphatase showed only a chemical hydrolytic process characterized by (M) over bar(w) and (M) over bar(n) decreases with time of incubation. The present study demonstrated that the degradation of PHO films is one of slow, chemical hydrolysis only, perhaps requiring several months of incubation. The hydrophobic nature of the long alkyl pendent chain in PHO may be responsible for this slow process. The inability of enzymes to degrade PHO may be attributed to the latter's poor adsorption capacity, due to its hydrophobic nature, and to a lack of specificity in the catalytic activity of these enzymes.","Univ Laval, Quebec Biomat Inst, Ctr Rech, CHUQ,Dept Surg,Lab Expt Surg, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; Univ Montpellier I, Fac Pharm, CRBA, CNRS,URA 1465, Montpellier, France; Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Guidoin, R (reprint author), Univ Laval, Expt Surg Lab, Room 1701,Serv Bldg, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,,,,28,16,16,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Albumin, fibrinogen, and dimyrstoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were used as model components. The amount of DMPC adsorbed on the MAPC polymers increased with an increase in the MAPC unit composition of the polymer. The methylene chain length of the MAPC unit was another factor influencing the DMPC adsorption when the MAPC unit composition of the MAPC polymer was low. The state of albumin and DMPC liposome adsorbed on the 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer was determined by dynamic contact angle (DCA) measurement. The adsorption strength of albumin on the MPC polymer was weaker than that on the poly[n-butyl methacrylate (BMA)], that is: the albumin was detached from the MPC polymer during the rinsing process. On the poly(BMA) surface, no difference in the shape of the DCA loops before and after contact with the DMPC liposomal suspension was observed. Fibrinogen adsorption on the MAPC polymer was detected by gold-colloid labeled immunoassay. The amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on every MAPC polymer surface was reduced by addition of the DMPC liposome in the fibrinogen solution. The number of platelets adhered on the MAPC polymer was also decreased when the DMPC liposome was present in the fibrinogen solution during pretreatment. We concluded that phospholipids were preferentially adsorbed on the MAPC polymer surface compared with plasma protein and that the adsorbed phospholipids played an important role in showing an excellent blood compatibility on the MAPC polymer.","Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Med & Dent Engn, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; Nihon Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Chem, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018308, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Iwasaki, Y (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Med & Dent Engn, Chiyoda Ku, 2-3-10 Kanda-surugadai, Tokyo 1010062, Japan.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,35,16,16,0,5,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Localized perturbations in the chemical potential of water as by, for example, contacting with a solid surface, induces compensating changes in water structure that can be sensed tens of nanometers from the point of origin using the surface force apparatus (SFA) and ancillary techniques. These instruments reveal attractive or repulsive forces between opposing surfaces immersed in water, over-and-above that anticipated by continuum theory (DLVO), that are attributed to a variable density (partial molar volume) of a more-or-less ordered water structure, depending on the water wettability (surface energy) of the water-contacting surfaces. Water structure at surfaces is thus found to be a manifestation of hydrophobicity and, while mechanistic/theoretical interpretation of experimental results remains the subject of some debate in the literature, convergence of experimental observations permit a quantitative definition of the heretofore relative terms 'hydrophobic' and 'hydrophilic'. In particular, long-range attractive forces (< 100 nm) are detected only between surfaces exhibiting a water contact angle theta > 65 deg (defined as hydrophobic surfaces with pure water adhesion tension tau(0) = gamma(0)cos theta < 30 dyn cm(-1) where gamma(0) is water interfacial tension = 72.8 dyn cm(-1)). Short range repulsive forces (< 5 nm) are detected between surfaces exhibiting theta < 65 deg (hydrophilic surfaces, tau(0) > 30 dyn cm(-1)). These findings together with other lines of chemical evidence suggest at least two distinct kinds of water structure and reactivity: a relatively less-dense water region against hydrophobic surfaces with an open hydrogen-bonded network and a relatively more-dense water region against hydrophilic surfaces with a collapsed hydrogen-bonded network. Solvent properties of interfacial water profoundly influence the biological response to materials in a surprisingly straightforward manner when key measures of biological activity sensitive to interfacial phenomenon are scaled against water adhesion tension tau(0) of contacting surfaces. Protein adsorption, activation of blood coagulation, and bioadhesion are offered as examples in point, illustrating that the hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrast in the biological response to materials, often disputed in biomaterials science, is very clear when viewed from the perspective of water structure and reactivity at surfaces.","Becton Dickinson Res Ctr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Vogler, EA (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Steidle Hall, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,95,165,167,1,41,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Surface analysis by dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that the mobility of the polymer chain on the PET substrate depended on the MPC unit composition, but there was no significant difference between the PMBs with 3-10 mol% MPC units and poly(HEMA). Fibronectin adsorption on the polymer surface from a cell culture medium was determined by immunoassay. The adsorbed fibronection was evenly distrubuted in every polymer, however, the amount was reduced with an increase in the MPC unit composition in the PMB. This result suggested that the MPC unit could weaken the interaction between the polymer surface and proteins. When fibroblast L-929 cells, were cultured on the polymers, the cells adhered and the number of cells increased on not only the hydrophobic poly(BMA) but also on the hydrophilic poly(HEMA). However, the number of cells that adhered on the PMB surface decreased with an increase in the MPC unit composition. This was a result of the fibronectin adsorption behavior. Thus, it could be concluded that since the PMB could suppress cell adhesion proteins e.g. fibronectin, the PMB showed excellent cell adhesive resistance properties.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Biomat & Bioengn, Div Organ Mat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010062, Japan","Ishihara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",,"Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/D-6870-2011","Iwasaki, Yasuhiko/0000-0003-1603-6174",,,,39,125,127,0,35,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

We have used PEO-polybutadiene-PEO triblock copolymer to graft PEG to biomaterials by gamma-irradiation for a total radiation dose of 1 Mrad. The molecular weight of PEG in the block copolymer was 5000. In vitro study showed that fibrinogen adsorption to Silastic(R) polyethylene, and glass was reduced by 70 similar to 95% by PEO grafting. On the other hand, the reduction of fibrinogen adsorption was only 30% on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE). III vitro platelet adhesion study showed that almost no platelets could adhere to PEG-coated Silastic(R), polyethylene, and glass, while numerous platelet aggregates were found on the ePTFE. The platelet adhesion in vitro corresponded to the fibrinogen adsorption. When the PEG-grafted surfaces were tested ex vivo using a series shunt in a canine model, the effect of the grafted PEG was not noticeable. Platelet deposition on ePTFE was reduced by PEO grafting from 8170 +/- 1030 to 5100 +/- 460 platelets 10(-3) mu m(2), but numerous thrombi were still present on the PEG-grafted surface. The numbers of platelets cumulated on Silastic(R), polyethylene, and glass were 100 +/- 80, 169 +/- 35, and 24 +/- 22 platelets 10(-3) mu m(2) respectively. This is about 35% reduction in platelet deposition by PEO grafting. While the numbers of deposited platelets were small, the decreases were not as large as those expected from the in vitro study. This may be due to a number of reasons which have to be clarified in future studies, but it appears that in vitro platelet adhesion and fibrinogen adsorption studies may not be a valuable predictor for the in vitro or ex vivo behavior of the PEG-grafted surfaces.","Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Park, K (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 39081],,,51,40,40,0,6,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Whereas most S. aureus clinical isolates elaborate a wide repertoire of bacterial surface 'receptors' called adhesins, exhibiting specific binding of individual host proteins, S. epidermidis is lacking most of such protein adhesins. To document the interactions between, S. epidermidis and various surface-adsorbed proteins, we first compared promotion of bacterial attachment by seven purified human proteins immobilized onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) coverslips. Only two of them, namely fibronectin and fibrinogen, exhibited adhesion-promoting activities. In the presence of native heparin or two functionalized dextrans (CMDBS for Carboxy Methyl, Benzylamide sulfonate/sulfate), a dose-dependent inhibition of S. epidermidis adhesion to fibronectin-coated, but not to fibrinogen-coated surfaces was observed. The inhibitory effects of each CMDBS were much stronger than that of native heparin. In contrast, a control highly negatively charged dextran exclusively substituted with carboxy methyl groups exerted no inhibition on S. epidermidis adhesion. To evaluate how CMDBS could interfere with S. epidermidis attachment to coverslips coated in vivo with extracellular matrix components, we also tested PMMA surfaces retrieved from tissue cages subcutaneously implanted in guinea pigs. Each CMDBS, but not heparin, strongly inhibited S. epidermidis adhesion to explanted coverslips, even in the presence of tissue cage fluid. In conclusion, fibronectin plays an important role in promoting S. epidermidis attachment to implanted biomaterials. Furthermore, S. epidermidis adhesion to fibronectin-coated or implanted biomaterials can be efficiently blocked in vitro by CMDBS.","Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland; Univ Paris 13, Lab Rech Macromol, CNRS UMR 7540, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Francois, P (reprint author), Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland.",,"Didier, letourneur/H-5268-2012","Didier, letourneur/0000-0003-2197-9468",,,,62,12,12,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Methods: a series of aluminium step-wedges were obtained from academic and industrial research laboratories. These were analysed by energy dispersive X-ray procedures. The set of step-wedges were independently characterised for radiopacity at two University dental schools. Results: the percentage of aluminium together with the percentages of minor alloying elements (magnesium, manganese, iron and silicon) have been determined as mass percentages. For each centre, the optical density versus step-height for all wedges was judged to fall on a common curve, with the main exception of one step-wedge that was found to contain 4% copper, by mass. A suitable calculation procedure was described explicitly. Conclusion: of the examined representative step-wedges, all but the aluminium-4% copper material were satisfactory and gave results comparable with wedges of high purity. Limits should therefore be revised for composition of aluminium radiopacity step-wedges or test blocks to a more realistic level of purity. Alloys with more than 0.05% copper or 1.0% iron should be excluded and the aluminium content should be at least 98% by mass. In the calculations deployed for deriving radiopacity as 'equivalent aluminium thicknesses', an appropriate linear regression procedure should be employed and considerable care taken in the evaluation of materials of low or borderline radiopacity, relative to specification limits. The method described is principally suitable for materials with radiopacity greater than 1 mm. For materials with radiopacity less than 1 mm aluminium, thicker specimens (2 mm) should be used.

Total joint replacement of the hip or knee joint has become common treatment; at the same time, an increasing number of fractures are treated with osteosynthesis. The original Charnley low-friction arthroplasty of the hip is still widely used and gives in large series excellent results. Aseptic loosening of this arthroplasty has been thought to be due to wear debris of the methylmethacrylate used for fixation of the implants, or to debris generated from wear of the polyethylene socket. To date, many different materials have been tried in order to reduce wear and generation of macrophage irritating submicron sized particles, or to provide more biocompatible components. However, trials to improve the methylmethacrylate cement or to invent better polyethylenes have often failed. Diamond coating of the metallic components seems promising: there is less wear and diamond is very biocompatible in bulk and small particulate form. Biodegradable implants have also been found useful in treating fractures. Bioactive bioabsorbable materials may also make possible a tissue engineering approach and can be used as carriers for selected drugs and cytokines. Because many promising materials and designs have failed in clinical use, extensive theoretical and experimental testing is mandatory before introducing new materials and implants in a clinical setting.","Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland; Yamagata Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Yamagata 990, Japan; Hosp Nuestra Senora de Gracia, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Zaragoza, Spain; Univ Helsinki, Dept Anat, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland; Natl Agcy Med, Helsinki, Finland","Santavirta, S (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Topeliuksenkatu 5, FIN-00260 Helsinki, Finland.",Seppo.Santavirta@huch.fi,"GOMEZ-BARRENA, ENRIQUE/A-2799-2008","GOMEZ-BARRENA, ENRIQUE/0000-0003-1065-6137",,,,31,36,36,0,9,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

Using this method, it is possible to fix poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels on polymer surfaces, e.g. on catheters, which drastically reduces the friction of these materials. Similarly, other biological relevant properties, especially reduced protein or bacteria adsorption can be achieved by choosing appropriate monomers. The substrate was first homogeneously dip-coated with e.g. the water-insoluble macroinitiator poly(octadecene-co-maleic anhydride), partially reacted to the tert.-butyl perester. Homogeneity, thickness, and reactivity of the macroinitiator layer was characterized in detail. After a temper step, surface homo- and copolymerizations of ionic monomers were carried out in water directly from the modified surface. The consistency of the hydrogel coating could be well controlled by the reaction conditions and the monomer composition. The correlation between the experimental parameters, the composition of the surface coating, and the friction properties was established.

Currently used methods, e.g. bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, show serious disadvantages concerning either sensitivity, specificity or handling. A new enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for the quantification of cell proliferation based on detection of the Ki-67 protein is described. This protein has turned out to be strictly correlated with the active parts of the cell cycle but to be absent in G(0). The measurement of Ki-67 expression by different human cell types, e.g. endothelial cells and HeLa cells, was evaluated in order to answer the question of whether the data obtained using the Ki-67 ELISA method correlate with the proliferation measured with flow cytometrical DNA analysis and microscopical evaluation. Methods currently used for the evaluation of cell proliferation were compared to the new Ki-67 ELISA method. In addition, the functionality of adherent endothelial cells, and the viability and morphology of the cells were investigated. Cells were treated with standard culture medium with or without the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, or growth factors, e.g. endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), and were exposed to metal ion standard solutions. These solutions were in a cytotoxic-non-cytotoxic range. Ki-67 ELISA was found to be a reliable quantitative method to assess proliferation of cultured human cells in vitro. It has advantages over methods that are currently being used. It is easy to perform and corresponds to the requirements for a test to be selected for biomaterial testing according to ISO standard 10 993.

In the present work we have studied the utility of a heparin-polypyrrole composite as a substrate for human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) growth. We found that the polymer composites were well suited to support cell attachment and growth; displaying low surface hydrophobicity (water contact angle of approximately 20 degrees) and roughness, R-q, of approximately 10-12 nm. Doubling times for HUVEC on heparin-polypyrrole were greater than observed for gelatin-coated tissue culture polystyrene (44 and 36 h, respectively), however, the cells did proliferate to cover the polymer in an even monolayer. The initial mechanism of attachment and subsequent proliferation of HUVEC on heparin-polypyrrole was critically dependent on the presence of the serum adhesion glycoprotein vitronectin. Polymers that were composed of polypyrrole and sodium nitrate were more hydrophobic than heparin-polypyrrole and they did not support HUVEC growth. Given the relative ease with which these polymer composites can be electrochemically synthesized, the diverse range of cellular ""signal agents"", e.g. growth factors, that can be incorporated within them, and the high degree of control that can be achieved in the release-surface exposure of these agents, we suggest that polypyrrole composites could serve a useful role as ""smart"" biomaterials in the near future.

To demonstrate the utility of this system, cell lines were developed which expressed human growth hormone (hGH) at levels exceeding 1 microgram per million cells per day. These were loaded into devices which were then implanted into juvenile nude rats. Significant levels of hGH of up to 2.5 ng/ml were detected in plasma throughout the six month duration of the study. In contrast, animals implanted with free cells showed peak plasma levels of 0.5 to 1.2 ng four days after implantation with no detectable hGH beyond 10 days. Histological examination of explanted devices showed they were vascularized and contained cells that were viable and morphologically healthy. After removal of the implants, no hGH could be detected which confirmed that the source of hGH was from cells contained within the device.

Design: Laboratory investigation using a polyvinylchloride pipe periarticular tibia fracture model. Setting: Simulated periarticular tibia fractures were created in a tibia model. Instrumented specimens were tested in a biomaterials resting system. Intervention: Groups of simulated periarticular tibia fractures were stabilized with one of nine different external fixation constructs with components from one manufacturer. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness was measured for each specimen in compression, torsion, flexion bending, extension bending, and varus and valgus bending. Results: The four-ring Ilizarov fixator was the stiffest in all modes of testing. There was a trend toward increasing stiffness with an increasing number of rings. Fixators constructed with multiple levels of fixation in the periarticular fragment were stiffer in all modes of testing, The additional spacing between wires gained by the use of a single thick carbon ring or the use of a drop wire three centimeters from a single ring did not increase stiffness in this model. Frame modifications intended to augment the bar-to-ring connection did not increase stiffness. The use of rings mounted with half-pins instead of a unilateral bar mounted with half-pins for diaphyseal fixation increased the stiffness of the frame only in torsional testing. Conclusions: Although the ideal stiffness of an external fixator is unknown, our results show that the addition of more than one level of fixation in the periarticular fragment increases the stiffness of hybrid external fixators in this periarticular tibia fracture model. Augmentation of the ring-to-bar connection did not significantly affect the stiffness of the Frame.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, Lexington, KY 40536 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Nashville, TN USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Rehabil, Nashville, TN USA","Pugh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, 740 S Limestone, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",,,,,,,22,27,29,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0890-5339,,,J ORTHOP TRAUMA,J.

The copolymers are polyester-polyamino acid hybrids, composed of a poly(L-lactic acid-co-L-lysine) (PLAL) backbone, and poly(L-lysine), poly(D,L-alanine) or poly(L-aspartic acid) side chains extending from the lysine residues of PLAL. The microparticles have been characterized with regard to their surface properties, morphology, and size. Thus, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis data and results of Zeta potential measurements suggest that the polyamino acid side chains tend to concentrate at the surface of the particles. Also, analyses by environmental scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy indicate that particles carrying poly(lysine) chains have an unusual porous structure, most probably due to the combined effects of the amphiphilic, polyelectrolyte, and chemical nature of the composing copolymer, as well as of the particular preparation technique employed. The capabilities of the microparticles to serve as carriers in controlled drug release and delivery devices were demonstrated by encapsulation and release of rhodamine B, a low molecular weight drug model.","MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Parma, Dipartimento Farmaceut, I-43100 Parma, Italy; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Langer, R (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, E25-342, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rlanger@mit.edu,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014; colombo, Paolo/I-3063-2012","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771; ",NIGMS NIH HHS [GM 26698],,,26,31,38,3,28,AMER PHARMACEUTICAL ASSN,WASHINGTON,"2215 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037 USA",0022-3549,,,J PHARM SCI,J.

Study Design/Materials and Methods: A film solder consisted of a white layer (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and distilled water) and a black layer (BSA, carbon black (CB), and distilled water). This two-layer solder was used with a diode laser to weld sections of dog small intestine (lambda = 810 nm, power = 200 +/- 20 mW, radiation dose = 18 +/- 1 J/mg). Sections of intestine were welded only with one-layer black solders as control group. The temperature difference between the external solder surface and the tissue-solder interface was evaluated during welding. Results: The two-layer solder performed welds as strong as the one-layer solder (similar to 0.12 N) but with less laser intensity on the black layer. The temperature difference between the external surface of the solder and the solder-tissue interface was significantly less for the two-layer solder than for the one-layer solder (similar to 6 degrees C and similar to 15 degrees C, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The two-layer solder appeared to be more efficient at soldering biomaterials than the one-layer solder. Furthermore, the heat diffusion from the black midplane of the two-layer solder decreased the difference in temperature recorded on the solder external surface and on the solder-tissue interface.

The specific variation of the material composition represents one option to affect the surface properties and to investigate their influence at biocompatibility. In the present study such a synthesis variation of ceramic biomaterials within the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 was examined since by varying the material composition the surface energy can be varied and thus adapted to the requirements of the biosystem respectively the test cells. That's why for the planned in-vitro investigations ceramics on the basis of the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 with variable composition and sufficient densities were developed by means of soi-gel techniques. It could be demonstrated that the surface energy respectively the surface enthalpy can be affected by a variable material composition. In this context the silicon oxide seems to be of special importance. Thus it could be shown that if the concentration of silicon oxide increases surface tension and polarity of the examined material surface increases too. Although the realized in-vitro tests confirm a good biocompatibility of the involved ceramics concerning cell proliferation and metabolic activity a significant correlation between surface properties and the observed cellular response could not be detected. Probably this result is ascribable only to the comparatively small parameter variations which were achieved by varying the material composition. A direct correlation between the cell behavior and the composition of the investigated materials based on the interface energy concept could not be proved for the ternary system Al2O3 - SiO2 - TiO2 in the present study.,"Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, FB Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heiligenstadt, Germany; Univ Jena, Tech Inst, Lehrstuhl Mat Wissensch, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Frant, M (reprint author), Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, FB Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0933-5137,,,MATERIALWISS WERKST,Materialwiss.

Articular cartilage chondrocytes from adult rabbit knees and from bovine calf metacarpophalangeal joints were isolated by enzymatic digestion and cultured in a monolayer system to amplify cell count. After amplification the cells were seeded on different biocompatible materials. We investigated two types of bioresorbable polymer fleece matrices (a composite fleece of polydioxanon and polyglactin and a resorbable poly-L-lactic acid fleece) and lyophilized dura as a biological carrier. On all three types of transport media the phenotypic and morphological appearance of cultured chondrocytes could be observed. The production of glycosaminoglycans was revealed by Alcian blue staining and immunohistochemical detection of Chondroitin-4 and 6-sulfate in the created constructs. The material properties of the carriers allow for transplantation of the artificial cartilage-like products into full thickness articular cartilage defects and could therefore improve the min or intrinsic healing capacity of cartilage tissue.

The Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu17.5 amorphous alloy showed as high polarization resistance as crystalline titanium in deaerated electrolyte with pH 7.5. With the small amount of chloride ion, this alloy did not show pitting corrosion on the polarization curve. Open-circuit potential which was always lower than pitting potential was ennobled with the decrease of pH The pitting potential was considerably ennobled by the dissolved oxygen because of the decrease of hydroxide ion and phosphate ion in the surface oxide. On the other hand, the extra oxygen retained nickel oxide in the surface film, causing the slight decrease of pitting potential. When titanium, niobium, indium, and tungsten were employed as M, the pitting potential of the Zr60M5Al7.5Cu27.5 amorphous alloys largely increased with the dissolved oxygen. The thermodynamic stability of oxide-state of these alloying elements was high.

For example, speckles generated by illuminating soft biological tissue with laser light are subject to rapid decorrelation due to the Brownian movement of water and scattering particles in the tissues and to cellular motions. In addition, the penetration of the laser beam into the tissue or translucent biomaterial results in multiple scattering and a complete depolarization of the speckle field. This may complicate the evaluation of the strain field when a force is applied to the material because the speckle pattern shift is providing information from the surface of the material as well as from the bulk sample, where the strains may or may not be the same as on the surface. This paper presents a variation of a speckle processing scheme originally called the 'Transform Method' for evaluating both surface and bulk strain rates and total strains in biological tissues and translucent biomaterials. The method is not a correlation based technique, but instead relies upon two-dimensional frequency transforms of time series of one-dimensional speckle pattern records stacked into two dimensional arrays. The method is insensitive to speckle field depolarization and, compared to correlation-based techniques, is relatively insensitive to speckle decorrelation. Strain rates and total in-plane strains were measured in both hard (cortical bone) and soft (artery segments) biological tissues and in translucent biomaterials (dental ceramics), Potential applications to medical diagnostics and biomaterials science are also discussed.","Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Biomat & Biomech, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3200-8,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3726,,,,,,504,511,,10.1117/12.341432,,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics",Materials Science; Mechanics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Optics,BM94U,WOS:000080215700063,,,,,2019-02-25

The high lateral resolution is the result of a sudden increase in reflectivity when the tip goes close to the surface at about 50 % vibration damping. This technique has been tested for samples of practical importance in the field of organic colourants and for Raman spectroscopy. In the first example the radial distributions of different disperse dyes within polyester fibers have been studied. SNOM measurements on cross-sections of coloured fibers allow separating the fluorescence signal of the dyes out of the total internal reflection signal with appropriate filters. The fluorescence SNOM images allow to quantify the penetration (diffusion) of the dye into the fibers. Ring-dyed and uniformly dyed fibers can easily be distinguished. Local photobleaching of fluorescence is demonstrated. Topographic and optical images correspond precisely both in mu m scale and in nm scale scans. In the second example fluorescent nanoparticles (100 - 200 nm diameter) embedded in thin films of polyvidone were studied by SNOM and AFM. The optical images provide single spherical particles (of correct size) as well as larger aggregates. The emerging topographies are 10 nm wider than the fluorescence SNOM images which allows to estimate a 5 nm coverage of the resin. In the third example local Raman SNOM spectra of scratched Si and its SiO2 cover, as well as of GaN were measured with an optoacoustic single photon counting spectrometer at 488 nm excitation in collection times of 10 min.

These biocompatible protective layers have been deposited on various metallic (stainless steel, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys) and polymeric (polyethylene) substrates. Residual stress in deposited materials may lead to distortion of the crystal lattice, cracks in the film, or delamination of the film. Residual stresses consist of thermal stresses, which are induced at temperatures other than the deposition temperature if the coating and substrate have different thermal expansion coefficients, lattice-misfit stresses, which occur during epitaxial growth due to lattice parameter misfit, and surface-tension stresses, which arise when force fields are created by the surface tension between islands of deposits grown from substrate sites favorable for precipitation. Adhesion, fretting, adhesive wear, and hence abrasive (third-body) wear of diamond and diamondlike carbon films can be minimized by reducing local stress levels and increasing atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region. This review discusses schemes to reduce local film stress levels and increase atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region for diamond and diamondlike carbon coatings on metallic substrates and diamondlike carbon coatings on polyethylene. The hardness of diamondlike carbon films has been continuously varied by doping these films with silver and titanium. We have also created diamond/titanium carbide and diamond/aluminum nitride composites, in which the amount of sp(3)-bonded carbon increases with film thickness. We have also created enhanced film adhesion and wear via these functionally graded firms. Thus, by reducing local stress levels and increasing atom-atom bonding within the interfacial region, we can improve adhesion and wear of diamondlike carbon and diamond coatings for biomaterials.","Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Narayan, RJ (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",,"Narayan, Roger/J-2789-2013; Narayan, Jagdish/D-1874-2009","Narayan, Roger/0000-0002-4876-9869; ",,,,10,0,0,0,4,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-427-5,,,,1999.0,,,,,,,355,365,,,,,,11,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Coatings & Films",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM95J,WOS:000080238600032,,,,,2019-02-25

Successful production of BMPs through recombinant DNA technology provides an opportunity to constitute new artificial implants with bone-inducing capacity by combining with synthetic implants. To build these bioactive implants, degradable polymer materials were synthesized, mixed with BMP and screened for their capacity to induce bone in an in vivo system. Implants consisting of polylactic acid (PLA) polymers and its derivative polymers with liquid and plastic properties in combination with rBMP consistently induced new bone in mice within a few weeks after implantation. Our data and the work of others suggest that these reconstituted bone-inducing materials have the potential to substitute bone grafts in the healing of fractures or repair of bone defects. The combination of this hybrid material with porous solid biomaterials could provide a bone-inducing implant with mechanical strength. Further preclinical and clinical work to check the safety of these implants will be necessary before they are adopted for widespread clinical use.","Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Takaoka, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Asahi 3-1-1, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0531-5131,,0-444-50029-4,INT CONGR SER,,,1999.0,1175,,,,,,141,151,,,,,,11,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Materials Science,BN11S,WOS:000080759400015,,,,,2019-02-25

Today the transplantation of these in vitro cultured keratinocytes in different modifications is an established clinical treatment regimen for therapy of extensive wounds. For example, keratinocyte-fibrin-glue-suspensions, mainly consisting of proliferative epidermal basal cells, were used for the treatment of burns in experimental and clinical settings to bypass the disadvantages of conventional sheet grafts. Other approaches in tissue engineering for wound healing aim at the (epi-)dermal repair by the combination of allodermis and biomaterials, i.e. collagen-sponges and microspheres. Due to most recent efforts in keratinocyte culture techniques, developments in tissue engineering, research for novel biomaterials and gene therapy, therapy of chronic wounds may prove to be more efficient.

It is therefore desirable to provide a crosslinking reagent that is of low cytotoxicty and can form stable and biocompatible crosslinked products. To achieve this goal, a naturally occurring crosslinking reagent-genipin-was used by our group to fix biological tissues. Genipin can be obtained from its parent compound geniposide, which can be isolated from the fruits of Gardenia jasminoides ELLIS. In our previous feasibility study, it was found that the cytotoxicity of genipin is significantly lower than both glutaraldehyde and an epoxy compound. Additionally it was shown that genipin can form stable crosslinked products. The present study further investigates the biocompatibility of a genipin-fixed porcine pericardium implanted subcutaneously in a growing rat model. The fresh, glutaraldehyde-, and epoxy-fixed counterparts were used as controls. It was noted that the inflammatory reaction of the genipin-fixed tissue was significantly less than its glutaraldehyde- and epoxy-fixed counterparts. Also, the genipin-fixed tissue has tensile strength and resistance against in vivo degradation comparable to the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue. Additionally, the calcium content of the genipin-fixed tissue measured throughout the entire course of the study was minimal. Nevertheless, further study in calcification for the genipin-fixed tissue should be conducted in a blood-contact environment. The results obtained in this subcutaneous study indicate that genipin is a promising crosslinking reagent for biological tissue fixation. However, further durability testing in vitro and in vivo are needed to determine the relative functional merits of this new crosslinker.

The ability of those activated platelets and platelet-derived microparticles to enhance coagulation reactions leading to thrombin/fibrin formation has not been well studied despite its potential significance. Activated platelets and platelet-derived microparticles are known to dramatically enhance the catalytic efficiencies of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes. In this paper, a modified Russell viper venom coagulation time test is used to quantitate material-induced procoagulant activity due to the generation of activated phospholipid surfaces. In our test system, polyethylene and Silastic(TM) tubes were filled with heparinized whole blood and left to gently flow back and forth at 37 degrees C. After 1 h, the blood within the tubes was gravity drained and the plasma fraction assayed for procoagulant activity. The clotting times were determined by a Coag-A-Mate X2 instrument after the automated addition of Russell viper venom (to activate factors V and X) and calcium ions. Appreciable procoagulant activity was generated during whole blood contact within polyethylene and Silastic(TM) tubes although significantly greater activity was generated by the latter surface. As previously reported, platelet-derived microparticles also were detected by flow cytometry. Filtration of the plasma after material contact through a 0.1 mu m filter led to substantial gains in clotting times and to near complete removal of microparticles, indicating that the material-induced microparticles likely were responsible for the procoagulant activity.

In a previous in vitro study we demonstrated that a collagen sponge constituted of type I collagen fibrils, chondroitin sulfates, and hydroxyapatite crystals induces an earlier and a more abundant synthesis of a new extracellular calcifying matrix than do other biomaterials such as collagen or hydroxyapatite alone. Bone mineral contains various amounts of magnesium ions, either adsorbed at the surface of apatite crystals or incorporated inside the crystal structure. Magnesium is known to reduce the degradation rate of tricalcium phosphate ceramics and to influence the crystallization of mineral substance. Thus we evaluated two sponges modified with different substituted apatites. The substituted low magnesium-containing apatite sample decreased the osteoinductive properties of the sponge whereas the substituted high magnesium-containing apatite sample had a toxic effect on bone cells and prevented the formation of any extracellular matrix. Such a toxic effect can be explained by the presence of large numbers of magnesium ions released into the culture medium even though at physiological level magnesium is able to promote bone mineralization and to control the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals. Thus collagen sponges containing hydroxyapatite remain one of the most appropriately evaluated biomaterials used for the restoration of periodontal pockets and bone defects.

Macrophages are an important component of the host inflammatory response, and we have examined the effect of PMMA and CoCr particles on the murine macrophage cell line J774A.1. Our objective was to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the particle-macrophage interaction, and we examined a number of basic biological responses of the J774A.1 cell line, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytokines secreted into the culture supernatant (TNF alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-6, and IL-12) and mRNA expression of the cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-6, IFN-alpha, M-CSF, and TGF-beta) in response to PMMA and CoCr particles. Our results indicate that the relative contribution of PMMA and CoCr particles in J774A.1 activation is negligible, and we observed a change in metabolic activity of J774A.1 cells only at higher concentrations of CoCr particles.

The relative emission intensity between both components strongly depends on the magnitude of the fluence and so do their velocities of expansion. Spectra as recorded have shown that at low fluences, molecular species predominate over atomic ones, whereas at high fluences, atomic species are the predominant ones. Images obtained with the aid of bandpass filters have revealed that the nature of the faster emissive component in the plume is mainly atomic, whereas emission from the second one mainly arises from excited molecular radicals.

After 3, 8, 12, and 24 weeks of implantation, histological investigation and histomorphometry were performed on undecalcified samples. Our results show that spontaneous bone healing in the empty cavities is significantly different (p < 0.05) between cortical (SBH > 80%) and cancellous bone sites (SBH < 31%) and that no new bone is formed in marrow tissue. For both porous ceramics, the highest osteogenesis was obtained in the cortical site. Osteogenesis was intermediate in the cancellous site and weak in the medullar site. The material biodegradation was the strongest in the medullar site and higher in the cancellous site than in the cortical site. Both activities were better in the beta-TCP than in the HA (p > 0.05). The marrow tissue presents a foreign-body reaction more reliable, sensitive, and durable than other bone tissues. Therefore, the cancellous bone site is a good site for evaluation of the biofunctionality of biomaterials because of the equilibrium of the osteogenesis and the biodegradation activities, but marrow tissue seems to be better for testing material biocompatibility in vivo.

The long-term follow-up (up to 78 weeks) indicated: (1) BCr and COMP induced a foreign-body inflammatory reaction but without fibrous encapsulation Phagocytosis was mediated by mononucleated macrophages (MC) and giant multinucleated cells (GMNC). Phagocytosis was stronger with COMP and required the recruitment of GMNC while it primarily involved MC in the case of BCP. (2) There appeared to be no significant difference between the bone ingrowth in the defects packed with BCP (dBCP) and in those filled with COMP (dCOMP). Bone reconstruction mostly was achieved after 4 weeks in dBCP but took more time to reach the center of dCOMP. High bone remodeling was observed at the last, evaluation times, especially in the case of COMP. (3) Degradation of the materials occurred mainly during the first 4 weeks and was more severe for COMP, which probably was related to the smaller granulometry of its mineral phase. Cell-mediated degradation went on for the 78 weeks and followed two processes: phagocytosis and/or extracellular dissolution of the calcium phosphate particles.

However, processing techniques utilized to fabricate these matrices typically involve organic solvents and/or high temperatures. Here we describe a process for fabricating matrices without the use of organic solvents and/or elevated temperatures. Disks comprised of polymer [e.g., poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)] and NaCl particles were compression molded at room temperature and subsequently allowed to equilibrate with high pressure CO2 gas (800 psi). Creation of a thermodynamic instability led to the nucleation and growth of gas pores in the polymer particles, resulting in the expansion of the polymer particles. The polymer particles fused to form a continuous matrix with entrapped salt particles. The NaCl particles subsequently were leached to yield macropores within the polymer matrix. The overall porosity and level of pore connectivity were regulated by the ratio of polymer/salt particles and the size of salt particles. Both the compressive modulus (159 +/- 130 kPa versus 289 +/- 25 kPa) and the tensile modulus (334 +/- 52 kPa versus 1100 +/- 236 kPa) of the matrices formed with this approach were significantly greater than those formed with a standard solvent casting/particulate leaching process. The utility of these matrices was demonstrated by engineering smooth muscle tissue in vitro with them. This novel process, a combination of high pressure gas foaming and particulate leaching techniques, allows one to fabricate matrices with a well controlled porosity and pore structure. This process avoids the potential negatives associated with the use of high temperatures and/or organic solvents in biomaterials processing.

Hydrolysis of PGA in 1N NaOH transformed ester groups on the surface of PGA fibers to carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups. After hydrolysis, the polymer scaffold retained its original gross appearance and dimensions while the fiber diameter decreased. A plot of fiber diameter versus the hydrolysis time showed a linear relationship, with a rate of decrease in fiber diameter of 0.65 mu m/min. The molecular weight and thermal properties of the polymer did not change significantly following surface hydrolysis. In cell seeding experiments, surface-hydrolyzed mesh was seeded with more than twice as many cells as unmodified PGA mesh. Vascular smooth muscle cells attached to the surface-hydrolyzed PGA mesh both as individual cells and as cell aggregates while only cell aggregates were observed on the unmodified mesh. Control experiments indicated that adsorption of serum proteins onto the surface-hydrolyzed PGA fibers was correlated with the increase in cell seeding density. These results demonstrate that optimization of biomaterial-cell interactions provides a strategy for increasing the initial cell seeding density for the engineering of tissues of high cell density.

When they enter blood vessels some of them are carried by proteins like albumin and can be taken up by endothelial cells lining the vessels. To study their involvement in the inflammatory response we investigated heavy metal ion induced effects in cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). NiCl2 and CoCl2 upregulate, especially in concentrations of 1 mM, the expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1), as well as the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, as shown by enzyme immunoassay and Northern blot analysis. In addition, possible signal transduction mechanisms were elucidated. The HUVECs were treated with various selective inhibitory drugs followed by the incubation of metal ions before measuring the expression of the above-mentioned endothelial factors. Two protein kinase inhibitors (H-7 and H-8) strongly repressed Ni2+ and Co2+ enhanced expression, as did the phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine. Other selective inhibitors of protein kinases C or A, or cGMP-dependent protein kinases, as well as calcium antagonists like 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethan-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzosaure 8-(diethylamino)-octylester and inhibitors of receptor mediated endocytosis (primary amines), had no influence. We showed that NiCl2 and CoCl2 activate the translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B into the cell nucleus and enhance its binding to a NF-kappa B consensus sequence as shown by mobility shift analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the activation of AP-1. Despite the repression of heavy metal induced adhesion molecule synthesis, we did not detect any inhibition of NF-kappa B translocation by H-7 or H-8. Therefore, it must be concluded that heavy metal ions like Ni2+ and Co2+ activate two or more signal transduction pathways in endothelial cells. We clearly showed that there is one pathway in which H-7 and H-8 sensitive protein kinases are involved and a second pathway leading to NF-kappa B activation, which is insensitive to H-7 and H-8. Our results demonstrate that heavy metal ions induce mechanisms of gene activation in endothelial cells as do proinflammatory mediators, indicating that corroding metal ion containing biomaterials can provoke inflammatory reactions by known, as well as by yet unknown, intracellular signaling pathways.

Despite the undisputed advantages of the polypropylene (PP) meshes currently available (Marlex(R), Prolene(R)), reports of complications after implantation are increasing. Although, serious complications such as perforation and fistula formation are rare, minor and local complaints such as seromas, misfeelings and a decreased abdominal wall mobility are observed in about one-half of the patients. In regard to the exaggerated strength of the currently available mesh modifications a reduction of the material should improve the integration of the meshes into the artificial abdominal wall. In the present study, the commercially available basic mesh Prolene(R) has been compared to two newly constructed PP-mesh modifications with reduced amounts of PP. The modifications have gradually been adopted to the physiological requirements of abdominal wall stability and mobility by reducing the amount of PP to 64% (E-BLUE) and 24% (variant A) of the Prolene(R) mesh (developed by ETHICON(R), Norderstedt, Germany). All PP-mesh variants have been implanted in a rat model and studied by 3D-photogrammetry, tensiometry, light- and electron microscopy, as well as morphometry over implantation intervals of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days. The data show that current constructions of PP-meshes are oversized and definitely restrict abdominal wall mobility in the present model. Sufficient stability of the artificial abdominal wall is even guaranteed by PP-mesh modifications with a reduction of PP-quantity to about 25% of the Prolene(R) mesh. The degree of fibrosis directly correlated with abdominal wall restriction, whereas the formation of connective tissue in the interface PP-fibre/host-issue depends on the amount and activity of the inflammatory reaction. The quantity and quality of inflammation, again, directly relies to the amount of PP and to the surface area in contact with the recipient tissues. Altogether, the present study suggests that a modification of the PP-meshes could be helpful to prevent major and minor complications of surgical PP-meshes.

Nevertheless, the behaviour of these materials, and in particular, the mechanisms guiding their interface response in physiological environment is still unknown. This work describes the construction of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate electrodes used to determine the interface potential behaviour of these materials in a simulated body fluid, in a pH range corresponding to the Variation observed in human body injuries, at ambient and physiological temperatures. These measurements are associated with the adsorption/desorption of ions from the materials. The results show that hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate have similar behaviour in that they reach an interface potential equilibrium state faster when the solution pH is decreased and the temperature increased.

The drawn samples have been characterized by mechanical tests, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The Young's modulus, E, and the stress at break, sigma(b), increase linearly with the draw ratio and reach values which are about five times those characteristic of undrawn samples. Furthermore, on stretching the alignment of the gelatin strands along the direction of deformation increases while the thickness of the layers decreases significantly. The renaturation level, that is the fraction of gelatin in a collagen-like structure, has been calculated as the ratio between the melting enthalpy of gelatin samples and that of tendon collagen. The results indicate that the improvement of mechanical properties achieved by drawn gelatin is closely related to the renaturation level. The experimental approach utilized to induce segmental orientation in gelatin films, allows to obtain anisotropic materials with improved mechanical properties in the direction of deformation, and can be usefully applied in the preparation of biomaterials.

This polymer can be classified as an alternating copolymer of succinic acid and desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine hexyl ester (DTH), a diphenolic monomer derived from the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. In this study, the effects of water uptake (hydration) on the secondary relaxations of poly(DTH succinate) were investigated using the technique of thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TDSC). Four relaxation peaks were precisely characterized by means of Gaussian activation energy distributions. Drying and rehydration treatments show that only small amounts of water, at most 0.5% (w/w), are necessary to hydrate two of the four polar moieties in poly(DTH succinate): the pendent chain ester carbonyls and the amide carbonyls in the polymer backbone. Water appeared to be more tightly bound to the amide carbonyl group and more loosely bound to the ester carbonyl group in the pendent chain. Even at a high state of hydration (1.2% w/w), TDSC indicated that no water was associated with the phenyl ester bond in the polymer backbone. This finding may explain the unexpectedly high stability of this polymer toward hydrolysis under physiological conditions. Polymer packing was also affected by hydration. In an intermediate hydration state (water content: 0.5% w/w) polymer packing was less dense than in the wet state (water content: 1.2% w/w). This study represents the first application of the TDSC technique to the study of hydration in a degradable biomedical polymer. The results obtained indicate that the TDSC technique may be useful to assist in the understanding of the mechanisms of hydration and subsequent hydrolytic degradation in degradable biomaterials.

Cell culture polystyrene (PS) was used as a reference, Cell numbers and cell viability were used as parameters of proliferation. Cell differentiation was assessed using alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen I and osteocalcin production. The parameters of proliferation showed earlier maximum values on PS and cpTi, while proliferation was delayed on SS and CrCoMb. The highest values of differentiation were found on cpTi. The development of alkaline phosphatase activity showed tao peaks reflecting apoptosis and redifferentiation. The cell culture system hFOB 1.19 is thus suitable for revealing differences in proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts on standard orthopaedic materials. The results correlate with previous in vivo findings. Using this system, the dynamic effect of the material surface on the differentiation process of osteoblasts can be demonstrated.","Univ Wurzburg, Orthopad Klin, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Expt Zahnheilkunde, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; Univ Wurzburg, Klin Forschergrp Med Poliklin, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Merklein, F (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Orthopad Klin, Konig Ludwig Haus,Brettreichstr 11, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",,,,,,,17,15,15,0,2,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

Materials and methods Collagen sponges were exposed to a continuous flow of urine at pH 5.3 and 6.3 for 1 week, The sponges were examined microscopically for crystal deposition and analysed for their calcium content. Two cell lines, RT112, derived from a well-differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, and UROtsa, an immortalized urothelial cell line, were seeded on the collagen sponges. Cells were cultured for 6, 12 and 21 days. The pattern of growth was analysed by histology and immunostaining with a pan-cytokeratin antibody. Growth was assayed to quantify cell proliferation on the sponges, Results No crystals were evident on any of the collagen sponges. Calcium deposition was negligible at pH 5,3. Although calcium levels were measurable at pH 6,3, the levels were very low, Both cell lines attached and grew in a stratified manner on the collagen sponge, RT112 forming a layer 6-8 cells thick, and UROtsa a layer 4-6 cells thick; cell proliferation was maximal at 5-10 days. The sponge remained easy to handle after 3 weeks in culture, Conclusion These findings show that collagen sponges support the growth and stratification of urothelial cells, and indicate that the collagen sponge is a suitable substrate for developing urothelial autologous grafts.","UCL, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, London W1P 7LD, England; UCL, Inst Urol, London W1P 7LD, England; Inst Biol & Chim & Prot, Lyon, France","Sabbagh, W (reprint author), UCL, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 67-73 Riding House St, London W1P 7LD, England.",,"Masters, John/C-5694-2011",,,,,35,20,20,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0007-1331,,,BRIT J UROL,Br.

A limitation of some proteins is their biologically imposed symmetry, which results in indistinguishable recognition surfaces. Here, we have explored methods for modifying the symmetry of an oligomeric protein that exhibits useful self-assembly properties. Results: Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (GS) contains 24 solvent-exposed histidines on two symmetry-related surfaces. These histidines drive a metal-dependent self-assembly of GS tubes. Immobilization of GS on the affinity resin Ni2+-NTA followed by on-column modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate affords asymmetrically modified GS that self-assembles only to the extent of 'short' dimeric GS tubes, as demonstrated by electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. The utility of Ni2+-NTA as a chemical mask was also demonstrated for asymmetric modification of engineered cysteines adjacent to the natural histidines. Conclusions: Current genetic methods do not provide distinguishable recognition elements on symmetry-related surfaces of biologically assembled proteins. Ni2+-NTA serves as a mask to control chemical modification in vitro of residues within symmetry-related pairs, on proteins containing functional His-tags. This strategy may be extended to modification of a wide range of amino acids with a myriad of reagents.","Univ Washington, Dept Med Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Ctr Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Atkins, WM (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Med Chem, Box 357610, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",winky@u.washington.edu,"Chin, Wei-Chun/A-6068-2008","Chin, Wei-Chun/0000-0003-4881-9085",,,,29,6,6,1,3,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",1074-5521,1879-1301,,CHEM BIOL,Chem.

Several biomaterials are available for the purpose of soft tissue augmentation, but none of them has all the properties of the ideal filler material. The recent development of hyaluronic acid gels for dermal implantation give the physician neu, possibilities of effective treatment in this field. OBJECTIVE. This study provides a clinical and histological evaluation of safety and efficacy of a cross-linked stabilized nonanimal hyaluronic acid gel (Restylane, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) to determine its characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and side-effects. METHODS. 158 patients were treated with facial intradermal implant of hyaluronic acid gel for augmentation therapy of wrinkles and folks, and for lip augmentation and/or recontouring. The results were evaluated in all patients by subjective judgement by the physician aim the patient, and by photographic method at time 0 and after 1, 2, 4 and 8 months from the procedure. In addition, a smaller histological study was carried out in five volunteer patients for a term of 52 weeks to determine the interaction and duration of the material ill human healthy skin. RESULTS. Clinically, both the physicians' and patients' evaluations revealed very satisfactory results, with a global 78.5% and 73.4% respectively of moderate or marked improvement after Eight months, independent of the treated area. The photographic evaluation revealed even better results with a 80.4% of moderate or marked improvement after 8 months. The safety evaluation showed a 12.5% of postoperative immediate adverse events, that were localized and transient. There was no evidence of major systemic sine effects. Histologically, the product was shown to be long-lasting and well tolerated as judged by histological techniques. CONCLUSIONS. Stabilized, non-animal, hyaluronic acid gel is well tolerated and effective in augmentation therapy of soft tissues of the face. This material presents several advantages in comparison to previously used injectable biomaterials and expands the arsenal of therapeutic tools in the field of soft tissue augmentation.

Results show that, before phase change occurs at any location, both radial and circumferential stresses are tensile and keep increasing until phase change begins. The maximum principal tensile stress during phase change increases with a decrease in boundary temperature (faster cooling). This is consistent with experimentally observed fractures at a lower boundary temperature. Large volumetric expansion during water to ice transformation was shown to be the primary contributor to large stress development.

The method simultaneously measures the resonant frequency, f, and the dissipation energy, D, of the oscillating system. The QCM responses are sensitive to very small amounts (a few hundreds) of cells and highly specific to surface chemical properties. The first results from deposition of cells on two polystyrene surfaces of different wettability in serum-containing medium are reported. It has previously been shown that a decrease in fis related to the deg ree of cell spreading.

Large-scale progressive changes in the composition of the resultant polymeric films were observed with sequential changes in the plasma duty cycle employed during polymerization, all other plasma variables held constant. The film compositional changes obtained are in the direction of increased retention of the lactam ring of the monomer in the resultant polymers as the duty cycles employed (i.e., the ratio of plasma on to plasma off times) were decreased. Particularly significant are the relatively linear polymeric structures obtained under the exceptionally low-average power deposition conditions made accessible with the pulsed plasma technique. XPS and FTIR spectroscopic examination of these latter films reveal compositions that are similar to those obtained by conventional(i.e., nonplasma) synthesis of the linear polymer. The film chemistry controllability demonstrated in the present study is achieved while maintaining the many advantages of the plasma polymerization approach for surface modifications. This work provides additional support for use of the pulsed operational mode as an effective means of film chemistry control, in particular extending the plasma polymerization technique to include synthesis of linear polymers, in Lieu of the more highly crosslinked structures typically produced in conventional continuous-wave plasma polymerization processes.

The granules and the titanium alloy were closed, and a reactive layer was formed at the interface between both of them. The implantation process of granules is divided in the following two steps. (I) First, the granules are implanted in the depth which is corresponding to the diameter with small stress. (2) Second, the whole of specimen is composed, and titanium alloy moves to the upper parts of the granules.

Unmodified (control) or aminosugar-containing (glucosamines or N-acetyl-glucosamines) hydrogels were implanted immediately or ten days after the lesions. Six months later, brain sections were processed for cresyl-violet, acetylcholinesterase, and immunocytochemical (glial fibrillary acidic protein, protein S100, neurofilaments, laminin, fibronectin) staining. All hydrogels were well integrated in the brain, constituting a stable bridge between the septum and the hippocampus. Weak gliosis occasionally surrounded the hydrogel in rats from the immediate-implantation group, whereas a more pronounced gliosis was observed in those from the delayed-implantation group. The hydrogels contained blood vessels and were invaded by host cells including astrocytes. Astrocytes formed a loose tissue network filling the porous structure of the hydrogels. Within the hydrogels, laminin-, fibronectin- or neurofilaments-immunopositive networks were also observed. Moreover, numerous acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers penetrated into the hydrogels from the septal, cortical and striatal areas. Fibre penetration was most important in the N-acetylglucosamines-containing hydrogels. Despite these features, the hippocampus failed to show any increase of acetylcholinesterase-staining as compared to that seen in lesion-only rats. These results confirm the regeneration capacity of severed septohippocampal neurons into polymeric substrates used as a bridge inserted in a fimbria-fomix lesion cavity. As such, biomaterials might be of clinical interest not only in the case of spinal cord sections, but also in cases of brain trauma.","Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7521, LN2C, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; Organogel Canada Ltee, Quebec City, PQ G1P 4R7, Canada","Cassel, JC (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7521, LN2C, 12 Rue Goethe, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",jean-christophe.cassel@psycho-ulp.u-strasbg.fr,,,,,,75,22,22,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0922-6028,1878-3627,,RESTOR NEUROL NEUROS,Restor.

Cements were based on four model glasses with varying reactivity and four poly(acrylic acid)s (PAA)s with number average molar masses (M-n) ranging from 3.25 x 10(4) to 1.08 x 10(5). Cement properties were studied at time intervals of one, seven and twenty eight days. Compressive strengths (sigma(c)) of the cements increased with increasing fluorine content of the glass, with increased molar mass of the PAA and with ageing time. The Young's moduli increased with time, but were lower for cements based on the fluorine free glass. Moduii values were independant of PAA molar mass. The un-notched fracture strength (sigma(f)) of the cement increased with the molar mass of the PAA and with ageing time. Glass composition did not appreciably influence the un-notched fracture strength. The fracture toughness (K-IC) increased with the molar mass of the PAA and with ageing time, but reduced with increasing fluorine content of the glass. The toughness (G(IC)) was dependant on molar mass. The influence of molar mass was not as great as predicted by the reptation chain pull-out model for fracture. The molar mass dependence of toughness was greatest with the lower fluorine content glasses. The plastic zone size at the crack tip increased with the molar mass of the PAA. However the plastic zone size decreased with ageing time for all the cements studied and was smaller for the more reactive higher fluorine content glasses.

Commonly, acute, postimplantation thrombocytopenia causes significant bleeding, requiring surgery or blood transfusions. Chronic complications include thromboembolic microevents that can affect central nervous system function. Pumps, explanted during donor organ transplantation, are often found to have an extensive cellular panus associated with the blood-contacting surfaces of the device. This natural cellular lining suggests a possible strategy for improving the blood biocompatibility of the HeartMate. Therefore, seeding of LVADs with cells genetically engineered to enhance their antithrombotic properties before implantation was investigated as a means to improve biocompatibility for long-term use. Methods and Results-Bovine vascular smooth muscle cells genetically engineered to produce nitric oxide were seeded on LVAD biomaterials and exposed to elevated shear stresses to determine cell-adhesive capabilities. Comparative studies were performed with vascular endothelial cells isolated from the same vessel. To assess the thrombogenic potential of the genetically engineered smooth muscle cells, monolayers were exposed to whole blood in parallel plate flow chambers and were platelet-adhesion quantified. This procedure used scanning electron microscopy and computer image-capture software. Endothelial cell monolayers and mock-transduced smooth muscle cells were assayed in a comparative manner. LVADs were seeded with genetically engineered smooth muscle cells and maintained under cell culture conditions for 96 hours. Thereafter, seeded LVADs were incorporated into in vitro flow loops. Cell retention within the pump was determined by sampling the effluent culture medium downstream of the pump and cell counting in a Coulter counter. After 18 hours of in vitro flow, a seeded pump was implanted into the abdominal cavity of a calf and anastomosed to the apex of the heart and to the descending aorta, More genetically engineered smooth muscle cells were retained on the surface of LVAD biomaterials when they were subjected to shear stresses up to 75 dyne/cm than endothelial cells assayed in the identical manner. Adherence of platelets to the surface of smooth muscle cells was significantly reduced after their transduction with nitric oxide synthase with GTP cyclohydrolase genes. Platelet deposition on the genetically modified myocyte layers was similar to that associated with endothelial cell layers. Cell loss from cell-seeded LVADs incorporated into in vitro flow loops remained <5% of the total cell number seeded regardless of the duration of flow. Conclusions-LVADs seeded with smooth muscle cells, transduced with the genes to optimize nitric oxide production, adhered well to the pump surface under in vitro and in vivo flow conditions.","Texas Heart Inst, Vasc Cell Biol Lab, Texas Med Ctr, Houston, TX 77225 USA; Texas Heart Inst, Texas Med Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Pathol, Houston, TX 77225 USA; Texas Heart Inst, Texas Med Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Surg Res, Houston, TX 77225 USA","Scott-Burden, T (reprint author), Texas Heart Inst, Vasc Cell Biol Lab, Texas Med Ctr, POB 20345, Houston, TX 77225 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-53233],,,25,2,2,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,NOV 10,1998.0,98,19,,S,,,II339,II345,,,,,,7,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,136YF,WOS:000076886100088,9852924.0,,,,2019-02-25

A novel NO delivery device has been developed to quantitatively study the effects of NO concentration and flux on the adhesion of platelets to a surface. The slit-flow device is lined with a protein-coated membrane through which NO gas permeates into a perfusing platelet suspension. A model predicting spatial NO concentrations and fluxes within the how slit was validated. At a wall shear rate of 250 s(-1), platelet adhesion was inhibited 87% relative to controls for exposures as low as 0.1 ppm NO. Corresponding model predictions of the aqueous NO concentration and fluxes at the surface were 0.15 nM, and between 0.5 and 1.1 nanomoles cm(-2) s(-1), respectively. Endothelial cells, which release NO to inhibit platelet adhesion in vivo, generate NO at an estimated flux similar to the above values. At a NO exposure of 0.02 ppm, platelet inhibition was only 10%. The delivery device is useful for other studies in which a knowledge of the spatial NO fluxes or concentrations is desired. Knowledge of these fluxes or concentrations is beneficial towards the design of biomaterials incorporating NO to inhibit platelet adhesion. (C) 1998 Biomedical Engineering Society.

Methods to reduce blood activation during prolonged assisted circulation are derived from cardiopulmonary bypass investigations. Improving the biocompatibility of artificial devices can be achieved either by biomaterial surface modifications, by inhibition of biologic cascades leading to blood activation, or by controlling end points of biologic cascades. However, the necessity to respect the integrity of the organism during prolonged assistance precludes most systemic interventions and limits the control of blood activation to the area of the device.

The poly(anhydride-imides) examined were poly[trimellitylimidoglycine-co-1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane] (TMA-gly:CPH) in 10:90, 30:70 and 50:50 molar ratios and poly[pyromellitylimidoalanine-co-1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane] (PMA-ala,CPH) in 10:90 and 30:70 molar ratios. The polymer matrices were compression-molded into circular discs, then implanted in rat subcutaneous tissues for nearly two months. At defined time intervals, the animals were sacrificed and explants analyzed. Proton NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed a complete absence of imide monomer units in PMA-ala:CPH compositions after 28 d and complete removal of imide units at 56 d from TMA-gly matrices. Gross observation of the implants closely correlated to the imide content: with decreasing imide content, the explants darkened and fragmented at a faster rate. The chemical compositions of the poly(anhydride-imide) explants were also monitored using IR spectroscopy. The residual amount of anhydride bonds in the polymer backbone following implantation were calculated from peaks specific to the anhydride bonds relative to the total amount of carbonyl bonds present. Initially, the imide (TMA-gly or PMA-ala) anhydride bonds were rapidly hydrolyzed then solubilized, followed by the slower hydrolysis of the CPH monomer anhydride bonds.

These inflammatory reactions may induce degeneration of implanted biopolymer. Interactions between implanted biomaterial and inflammatory cells are mediated by many cellular events involving cellular adhesion and activation. We studied the inflammatory responses in vivo and in vitro to samples of biopolymers composed of poly(ethylene terephthalate-cn-diethylene glycol terephthalate) plus 0, 5, 25% of polyethylene oxide. We observed that these biopolymers did not induce inflammatory responses when implanted in the peritoneal cavity of mice for 28 days. However we observed deposition of hyaluronic acid at the surface of implanted biomaterial, suggesting that tolerance to biomaterial occurred after surgical implantation. No significant adhesion of inflammatory cells such as mononuclear phagocytes and peripheral leukocytes were observed in vitro, when poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-diethylene glycol terephthalate) blends were used as substratum to cellular adhesion. These results suggest that blends composed of poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-diethylene glycol terephthalate) induce low inflammatory cell adhesion, since no rejection of biopolymer was observed when implanted in experimental animal models.

The biocompatibility of a material is determined by interactions at the interface between implant and biological system. The physicochemical surface properties of the materials used, for example, chemical composition, wettability, surface energy and electrical surface charge, therefore play an important role. Within the framework of the investigations described here, specific modifications of the surfaces properties of titanium are effected using various methods with the aim of achieving a positive influence on cell growth and cell attachment. To characterize the physicochemical surface properties, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used. In addition to the clearly altered chemical composition of the modified material surface, it proved possible to determine significant changes in the thermodynamic properties with the aid of contact angle measurements and the determination of surface energy. On the basis of these results, important information about possible interactions at the interface between implant and tissue can be obtained.","Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, Fachbereich Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany","Liefeith, K (reprint author), Inst Bioprozess & Anal Messtech EV, Fachbereich Biowerkstoffe, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,FACHVERLAG SCHIELE SCHON,BERLIN,"MARKGRAFENSTRASSE 11, D-10969 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,,,BIOMED TECH,Biomed.

The efficacy and safety of the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of hard denial tissue as well as the effects of dental irradiation on the pulp and periodontium have been investigated. Odors resulting from laser irradiation have been reported, but the nature and toxicity of associated decomposition vapors is unknown and the health consequences of their inhalation have not yet been studied. Objectives. The purpose of this in vitro study was to identify vapors emitted during interaction of the Nd:YAG laser with carious human enamel and dentin and sound enamel and dentin coated with organic ink. Methods. Vapor emissions were collected from prepared sections of extracted human teeth receiving laser irradiation of 100 mJ and 10 Hz for a duration of 1, 10, or 60 s. Emissions were collected by means of charcoal absorption tubes, and subsequently analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph equipped with Mass Selective (GC/MS) and Flame Ionization Detectors to identify the chemical constituents of the vapors. Results. No compounds were identified in Nd:YAG laser-treated caries, enamel and dentin. No volatile vapors were identified from samples of tooth material exposed to the laser for 1 or 10 s. Camphor was positively identified in the test sample which consisted of India ink-coated dentin and the reference sample of India ink-coated glass beads, both exposed to the laser for 60 s. 2,5-norbornadiene was tentatively identified in these samples. The Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of camphor is 2 ppm with a Lethal Dose Level (LDLo) of 50 mg/kg (human oral), while the TLV and LDLo of 2,5-norboradiene is unknown. Significance. Occupational and public health safety measures are discussed in this article. Further research is needed to quantify the compounds produced and to determine their toxicity to patients and to dental care providers. (C) 1999 Academy of Dental Materials.

Biomaterial surfaces engineered to present cell adhesion ligands undergo integrin-mediated molecular interactions with cells (1, 4, 5), stimulating cell spreading, and differentiation (6-8). This provides a mechanism for mimicking natural cell-to-matrix interactions. Further sophistication in the control of cell interactions can be achieved by fabricating surfaces on which the spatial distribution of ligands is restricted to micron-scale pattern features (9-14). Patterning technology promises to facilitate spatially controlled tissue engineering with applications in the regeneration of highly organized tissues. These new applications require the formation of ligand patterns on biocompatible and biodegradable templates, which control tissue regeneration processes, before removal by metabolism. We have developed a method of generating micron-scale patterns of any biotinylated ligand on the surface of a biodegradable block copolymer, polylactide-poly(ethylene glycol). The technique achieves control of biomolecule deposition with nanometer precision. Spatial control over cell development has been observed when using these templates to culture bovine aortic endothelial cells and PC12 nerve cells. Furthermore, neurite extension on the biodegradable polymer surface is: directed by pattern features composed of peptides containing the IKVAV sequence (15, 16), suggesting that directional control over nerve regeneration on biodegradable biomaterials can be achieved.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Shakesheff, KM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",kevin.shakesheff@nottingham.ac.uk,"Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009; Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009","Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,51,201,205,2,27,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,NOV,1998.0,12,14,,,,,1447,1454,,,,,,8,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,134NM,WOS:000076749500003,9806753.0,,,,2019-02-25

The BMPs are the only factors known to provoke bone formation heterotopically by making undifferentiated formation heterotopically by making undifferentiated mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts (osteoinduction). Much of our knowledge of osteoinduction derives from studies in rodents of heterotopically implanted demineralised bone which contains various growth factors, including BMPs. This model has been used to examine the effect on osteoinduction of different factors, including the type of host soft tissue, age and species of donor and recipients, demineralisation procedure, storage and sterilisation procedures, experimental diabetes, dietary factors, hormones, growth factors, caffeine, biphosphonates, indomethacin and biomaterials. Demineralised bone enhances bone formation experimentally in various animal models, including cranio-maxillofacial reconstructions, healing of diaphyseal defects, and spinal fusion; demineralised bone has also been used in a limited way clinically. However, sufficient osteoinduction in humans may require a higher concentration of BMPs and other growth factors than those found in demineralised bone.","Univ Bergen, Deaconess Hosp, Sect Orthopaed, N-5009 Bergen, Norway","Solheim, E (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Deaconess Hosp, Sect Orthopaed, Haraldsplass, N-5009 Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,96,26,34,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0341-2695,1432-5195,,INT ORTHOP,Int.

It was found that chondrocytes retained their spherical shape and typical chondrocytic appearance. During the culture time, chondrocytes underwent differentiation, as demonstrated by the alkaline phosphatase-specific activity and rate of proteoglycan synthesis. Morphological data confirmed chondrocyte differentiation with the appearance of hypertrophic chondrocytes scattered in the alginate gel and a dense extracellular matrix containing filamentous structures and matrix resides. In addition, Northern blot analysis performed on day 8 of culture showed that chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads expressed type II collagen mRNA. The alginate bead method also appeared to be suitable for testing biomaterials, and the ready dissolution of the alginate beads by chelating agents provided a simple means for the rapid recovery of encapsulated chondrocytes. Powdered glass-ceramic particles entrapped in the alginate gel were colonized by chondrocytes, which then proliferated and formed a tissue similar to a true calcified cartilaginous structure. These results indicate that the alginate system represents a relevant model for studies of chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification. Furthermore, the encapsulation method could prove useful for studies of tissue-biomaterial interactions in an in vitro environment which more closely mirrors the cartilage matrix than other culture methods.

Osteoblastic response to thin-film coated plates was compared to that of cells grown on Ti alloy disk inserts and uncoated culture plates. The Ti alloy disks were polished, cleaned, and passivated following a commercial protocol for orthopedic implants. Mean surface roughness was 262 nm for the Ti alloy disks and 4.756 nm for the coated culture plates. Osteoblasts isolated from 16-day chick embryo calvariae were cultured on polystyrene, thin films, and disks. At confluence, the cells were cultured an additional 48 h and were evaluated for cell number (DNA content), rate of glycolysis (lactate production), alkaline phosphatase activity (ALPase), and collagenous (H-3-proline hydroxylation) and noncollagenous protein synthesis. Cell morphology was similar for the controls, disks, and thin-film groups. DNA, lactate, cell layer ALPase, H-3-hydroxyproline, and noncollagenous protein were not different (p > 0.05) among the control, thin-film, and disk groups. Medium ALPase was lower (p < 0.05) in the thin-film group compared to the control group. Although aluminum and vanadium percentages varied from nominal in the thin-film groups (11A1-2V as opposed to 6A1-4V), avian osteoblasts responded similarly to the Ti alloy thin films, disks, and uncoated culture plates for the smooth surfaces tested. The thin-film cell culture system used for elemental material studies appears to offer a promising method for the investigation of cellular response to alloyed biomaterials as well. Proper adjustments in alloy percentages before deposition, however, need to be made if thermal evaporation is utilized.

When oxide films are abraded, repassivation and ionic dissolution both occur at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than undisrupted surfaces. The excess electrons generated by these anodic processes must be consumed in corresponding reduction reactions that include the reduction of oxygen. If large enough, these reduction reactions may locally deplete the concentration of solution-dissolved oxygen and, in turn, affect cell behavior in the vicinity of the implant surface. To date, this hypothesis has not been tested. In the present study, a scanning electrochemical microscope was used to measure oxygen concentration profiles in vitro near a planar titanium electrode polarized to different voltages representative of those attainable by titanium undergoing mechanically assisted corrosion. The potentials investigated ranged from 0 mV to -1000 mV (AgCl). The oxygen concentration as a function of distance from the titanium surface was measured using a platinum-iridium microelectrode and an amperometric technique. Also, preliminary experiments were performed to assess the response of rat calvarial osteoblast-rich cells cultured for 2 h on titanium samples polarized to two different potentials (0 mV and -1000 mV versus AgCl). The results of this study indicate that oxygen concentrations near titanium surfaces are affected by sample potentials out to probe-sample distances as great as 500 mu m. Within 2 mu m of the surface, oxygen concentrations decreased by 15 to 25% for sample potentials between -100 and -500 mV. At potentials more negative than -600 mV, the oxygen concentration dropped rapidly to near zero by -900 mV. The cell experiments showed a statistically significant difference in the amount of cell spreading, as measured by projected cell area, between the two groups (p < 0.03), with the cells cultured at -1000 mV undergoing much less spreading. This implies that -1000 mV inhibits normal cell behavior at the titanium surface and that this is most likely due, at least in part, to a diminished oxygen supply.

Initially the S2-glass(R) composites were generally stiffer and stronger than comparably reinforced quartz composites, but within 1 wk the properties of S2-glass(R) composites decreased by 12%-26%. The properties of quartz composites were relatively stable, except for those of composites with the least reinforcement (35 vol%), which decreased by roughly 15%. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that in all composites buckling had occurred at the site of load application. Evidence of good fibre-matrix adhesion was observed for both types of composites under all conditions. Modelling of degradation between 1 wk and 3 mon revealed that: (1) the only temporal change was a slight increase in the stiffness of S2-glass(R) composites; and (2) higher reinforcement levels reduced the retention of strength in S2-glass(R) composites but had the opposite effect ton both properties) for quartz composites (p < 0.05). For the most highly reinforced S2-glass(R) composites, susceptibility to degradation was offset by high initial properties; and after ageing (elastic modulus approximate to 50 GPa, strength approximate to 1.2 GPa), these composites were still, on average, approximately 25% stiffer and 50% stronger than the more hydrostable quartz counterparts.

The experiment was carried out on 25 Wistar rats. After exposing the mandibular ramus bilaterally, 5 mm diameter full-thickness circular bone defects were surgically created. While the defect on one side was covered by the membrane (experimental), the defect on the other side was left uncovered (control) before closure of the overlying soft tissues. The rats were sacrificed in groups of 5 after 7, 15, 30, 90, and 180 days of healing. Although at early stages of healing similar amounts of bone formation were observed in the experimental and control defects, after 1 month of healing, most of the experimental defects were completely closed with new bone, while in the control defects, only limited amounts of new bone were observed at the rims and in the lingual aspect of the lesions. In the 90- and 180-day animals, all experimental defects were completely closed, while in the control defects, no statistically significant increase in bone regeneration was observed. The increase in percentage of bone regeneration in the experimental defects was statistically significant between the 15-day specimens as compared with the 7-day specimens (P < 0.01) and likewise between 30-day and 15-day specimens (P < 0.001). It can be concluded that a DPPA-crosslinked collagen membrane yields biocompatibility, ad hoc mechanical hindrance, and handling characteristics suitable for guided bone regeneration applications in this experimental model.","Univ Liege, Sart Tilman Univ Hosp, Sch Dent, Dept Periodontol & Implantol, Liege, Belgium; Catholic Univ Louvain, Sch Dent Med, Dept Periodontol, Brussels, Belgium; Free Univ Brussels, Brugmann Univ Hosp, Dept Periodontol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Toulouse 3, Fac Odontol, Dept Oral Biol, F-31062 Toulouse, France; Univ Liege, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Liege, Fac Med, Dept Histol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Geneva, Fac Med Dent, Dept Oral Surg & Stomatol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Zahedi, S (reprint author), European Oral Rehabil Ctr, Rue de la Loi 235, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",shahram.zahedi@skynet.be,,,,,,44,46,47,0,2,AMER ACAD PERIODONTOLOGY,CHICAGO,"737 NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE, SUITE 800, CHICAGO, IL 60611-2690 USA",0022-3492,,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Since fibrinogen (FBGN) and immunoglobulin (IgG) coat the implanted biomaterial surface, it is with these immobilized proteins that the neutrophil (PMN) interacts. This study tests the hypothesis that PMN are impaired in their ability to kill bacteria when bound to immobilized IgG or FBGN. Isolated human PMN were bound to FBGN or IgG: and then left untreated or exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 10(-7) M). PMN adhered loosely, but did not spread, onto FBGN. In contrast, PMN spread fully onto IgG, exhibiting polarized pseudopodia. PMA treatment induced spreading of the FBGN bound cells. Suspended and adherent PMN were incubated 1 h with C-14-labeled Staphylococcus aureus; then, phagocytosis was assessed by radioactive uptake or bacterial kill. was determined by plating recovered bacteria and colony counting. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test. We observed that both the phagocytic and the killing ability of FBGN-bound PMN were similar to that of suspended PMN. Conversely, IgG-bound PMN displayed a 62 +/- 6% (P < 0.01) decrease in phagocytosis and 33 +/- 7% (P < 0.05) reduction in bill vs suspended cells. PMA induced a 74 +/- 6% (P < 0.01) reduction in phagocytosis and 68 +/- 5% (P < 0.01) reduction in kill of bacteria for PMN bound to FBGN with no further effect on IgG-bound PMN. Using fluorescent vital dyes and confocal microscopy we determined that 33% fewer PMN were engaged in phagocytosis when bound to IgG vs FBGN. We conclude that Fc receptor ligation by immobilized IgG or PMA treatment of the FBGN-adherent PMN triggers cell spreading and reduced bactericidal activity. These results indicate that excessive cytoskeletal organization may impair the ability of PMN to kill bacteria and result in vascular graft infections.

Methods: These biomaterials were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsum of 11 guinea pigs after contamination with Staphylococcus aureus and examined with scanning electron microscopy after 7 days. Wounds were also inspected for infection and extrusion rates. Results: Results show biofilm formation on titanium, silicone, ion-bombarded silicone, e-PTFE, and PHDPE associated with high rates of extrusion and infection. Implants of e-PTFE with silver/chlorhexidine, on the other hand, appeared resistant to biofilm formation and demonstrated significantly lower rates of extrusion and infection. Conclusions: contamination of bioimplants in vivo leads to formation of bacterial biofilm on the surface of the biomaterial, causing infection, pus formation, and extrusion. The authors hypothesize that the antiseptic agents impregnated in the biomaterial form a protective coat of silver, chlorhexidine, and inflammatory cells that inhibits initial bacterial adhesion to the biomaterial surface.","Univ Maryland, Med Syst, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Biedlingmaier, JF (reprint author), Maryland Gen Hosp, Head Serv, 827 Linden Ave, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",,,,,,,21,22,23,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0023-852X,,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,NOV,1998.0,108,11,1,,,,1733,1738,,10.1097/00005537-199811000-00026,,,,6,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,136NY,WOS:000076867000026,9818835.0,,,,2019-02-25

This behavior is in contrast to the general situation with synthetic composites, where toughness is generally found to decrease with increase in modulus and tensile strength. Preserving toughness is very important in many applications, as very high strength cannot be exploited if a material is sensitive to small amounts of damage. The structures-properties relationships documented in biomaterials may provide guidance for improving the performance of synthetic composites, in a type of biomimicry. This paper identifies some key aspects of such biomimetic designs in natural fibers and composites, and describes some efforts in the recent past to duplicate structures and properties in synthetic composite materials, particularly with regard to toughness.

However, the broader application of ceramics is limited because they are brittle and prone to catastrophic failure. By contrast, naturally produced ceramic organic biocomposites can possess mechanical properties which make them suitable for use as biomaterials. An example would be the mollusc shell, where an inorganic phase grows onto a charged and organised organic template. This natural biomineralization provides a calcium carbonate phase with satisfactory mechanical properties appropriate for surgical implantation. It is reported how Langmuir Blodgett films have been used as organic templates for calcium phosphate crystallization. Three different Langmuir Blodgett Films: omega tricosenoic acid, stearic acid and octadecylamine have been investigated. The Langmuir Blodgett Films produced had methyl (CH3) and calcium carboxylate (CaCOO) as functional groups. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy shows that calcium phosphate crystallization occurs in a similar manner to natural biomineralization. The calcium carboxylate head group appears to have a physical influence on the morphology and distribution of the calcium phosphate crystals. Under the experimental conditions tested, the calcium carboxylate functional head group controls calcium phosphate crystallization by a biomimetic approach. This study strongly suggests that this approach has the potential for producing high performance ceramics comparable with those made by mollusc shells. (C) 1998 IPEM.

During the last few years, much attention has been paid to hydroxyapatite and p-tricalcium phosphate as potential biomaterials for a bone substitute. Good implantation of biomaterials in the skeleton is evidenced by an ability to reach full integration of the non-living implant with living bone. The aim of this study is to correlate hydroxyapatite osseointegration with Young's Modulus. Cylinders (5-6 mm in diameter) of these ceramics were packed into holes made in the femur diaphysis of a mature sheep. At 2, 4. 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after the operation, samples of the bone/implant interface were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate.

At 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after implantation we studied Young's Modulus on a biopsy of the ceramic. Young's Modulus increased with time after implantation and is linked with biomaterials integration into cortical bone. (C) 1999 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since a large number of biomaterials are currently used in neurosurgery, only the biomaterials that have been developed in our laboratories in collaboration with neurosurgeons are briefly presented here. The biomaterials developed include devices used for interventional neurosurgery and bioabsorbable scaffolds for regeneration of dura mater and skull bone. We developed an immediately electrically detachable coil using a poly(vinyl alcohol) junction between the coil and the delivery wire. This is the first detachable coil developed in Japan and is currently under clinical trial. In addition to the coil used for interventional neurosurgery, the development of an embolic liquid is presented, As an alternative to allografts such as Lyodura, we developed a dural substitute from synthetic bioabsorbable polymers which are completely free from potential risk of latent virus infection. Finally, our experience in tissue engineering for skull bone regeneration using growth factors coupled with polymeric carriers is presented to demonstrate the promise of tissue engineering in the future.","Kyoto Univ, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Ikada, Y (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, 53 Kawahara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",,,,,,,7,4,4,0,3,JAPAN NEUROSURGICAL SOC,TOKYO,"C/O AKAMON-MAE IWATA BLDG, 5-27-8 HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",0387-2572,,,NEUROL MED-CHIR,Neurol.

The analysis of the results obtained by plotting the temperature dependence of current density, Poole-Frenkel plots, Schottky plots, Richardson plots and Arrhenius plots shows that the Schottky-Richardson mechanism is responsible for the observed d.c. conduction in amylase. Furthermore, the presence of Schottky barriers at the metal electrode-insulator interface suggests that, by using silver electrodes, satisfactory contacts can be achieved for electrical investigations on biomaterials.

The esterification reactions were conducted in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine as a catalyst. The optimal reaction time (6 h) was determined by monitoring the concentration of free carboxylic acid of the N-protected amino acids during the reaction. The degree of substitution per fructose unit was 0.95 for inulin-lysine and 1.01 for inulin-glycine. The resulting biopolymer was deprotected by catalytic transfer hydrogenation method using 1,4-cyclohexadiene as an effective hydrogen donor. The structures, molecular weight, and thermal properties of the amino acid esters of inulin were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H-1 and C-13 NMR, UV, viscosity, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

These polymers degrade by hydrolysis and enzymatic activity and have a range of mechanical and physical properties that can be engineered appropriately to suit a particular application. Their degradation characteristics depend on several parameters including their molecular structure, crystallinity, and copolymer ratio. These biomaterials are also rapidly gaining recognition in the hedging field of tissue engineering because they can be fashioned into porous scaffolds or carriers of cells, extracellular matrix components, and bioactive agents. Although their future appears to be bright, several questions regarding the biocompatibility of these materials linger and should be addressed before their wide-scale use. In the context of musculoskeletal tissue, this report provides a comprehensive review of properties and applications of biodegradable PLA/PGA polymers and their copolymers. Of special interest are orthopaedic applications, biocompatibility studies, and issues of sterilization and storage of these versatile biomaterials. Also discussed is the fact that terms such as PLA, PGA, or PLA-PGA do not denote one material, but rather a large family of materials that have a wide range of differing bioengineering properties and concomitant biological responses. An analysis of some misconceptions, problems, and potential solutions is also provided.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA; Plano Orthoped & Sports Med Ctr, Plano, TX USA","Athanasiou, KA (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78284 USA.",,,,,,,95,281,296,6,82,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0749-8063,1526-3231,,ARTHROSCOPY,Arthroscopy,OCT,1998.0,14,7,,,,,726,737,,10.1016/S0749-8063(98)70099-4,,,,12,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,127VY,WOS:000076372300009,9788368.0,,,,2019-02-25

Results indicated the absolute absence of cytotoxic or cytostatic effect of Pyrost(R) on cultured osteoblasts. Viability rate was more than 90% in cells cultured with the material compared to the control. Morphological analysis, undertaken by scanning electron microscopy showed a good adhesion and a spreading of osteoblasts in contact with the material that was colonized by cultured cells. In the second part of this work, we have introduced two methods as complementary biocompatibility tests: DNA image cytometry and interphase Ag-NORs quantification. DNA content was measured in cells cultured with or without Pyrost(R) for 3, 9, 15 and 30 days. The determination of DNA indicated that the majority of osteoblasts population was diploid without aneuploidy. The DNA index and cell distribution profile in DNA histograms were similar in all cell populations. The Ag-NORs amount was used as a parameter for cell kinetic evaluation. We have measured the Ag-NORs index like DNA quantification. The proliferation rate, evaluated by Ag-NORs counts in osteoblasts cultured with or without the material, was identical. However, a decrease in Ag-NORs index was observed from day 3 to day 15 of incubation. These results showed a satisfactory biocompatibility of the Pyrost(R) in human osteoblasts culture, The material did not alter cell viability and had no inducing effect either on proliferation rate or on cell ploidy as demonstrated by DNA image cytometry and Ag-NORs proteins staining.

We have studied the growth and interactions of human bone marrow cells on a variety of new cement composites in vitro. These cement materials are composed of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatites, carbonated apatite and amorphous calcium phosphate. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced and cell differentiation increased in the presence of these cements compared with cells cultured on tissue culture plastic. Alkaline phosphatase, one of the markers of the osteoblast phenotype, was dramatically stimulated by 3 of the 4 cements examined between day 4 and day 10, above levels observed following culture of human osteoblasts on plastic alone. Photomicroscopic examination demonstrated growth and close integration of bone marrow cells and 3 of the composites. Longer term marrow cultures (15 day) on the cements confirmed the stimulation of cell differentiation over proliferation. From these studies, enhanced osteoblastic differentiation was observed on a 70% carbonated apatite, which has a composition similar to bone mineral, whereas, cell toxicity was observed on cells grown on amorphous calcium phosphate. This in vitro culture system demonstrates the use of human bone marrow cells for the potential evaluation of new biomaterials and the development of a novel carbonated apatite that may be of potential use in orthopaedic implants.

Polyethylene-glycol-diisocyanate (PEG-diisocyanate, 3400 MW) may potentially react with protein amines to form molecular barriers on adsorbed proteins on biomaterials, thereby masking adhesive ligands and preventing acute surface thrombosis. To test this notion, PE, PTFE, and glass microconduits were pre-adsorbed with fibrinogen and treated with PEG-diisocyanate, non-reactive PEG-dihydroxyl, or remained untreated. Following perfusion of In-111-labeled platelets in whole human blood for 1 min (wall shear rate = 312 s(-1)), PEG-diisocyanate treated surfaces experienced 96% (PE), 97% (PTFE) and 94% (glass) less platelet deposition than untreated surfaces. Similar reductions were seen for PEG-diisocyanate versus PEG-dihydroxyl treatment. Low shear perfusions of plasma for 1 h prior to blood contact did not reduce the inhibitory effect of PEG-diisocyanate. Platelet adhesion onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and platelet deposition onto preclotted Dacron were also reduced by treatment with PEG-diisocyanate(93 and 91%, respectively). Protein-reactive PEG may thus have utility in forming molecular barriers on surface-associated proteins to inhibit acute thrombosis on cardiovascular biomaterials.

Background: Although several attempts have been made to occlude defects within the oval fossa by transcatheter techniques, none of these has gained general acceptance. Methods: Patients with a defect in the oval fossa measuring equal to or less than 20 mm diameter, with a residual septal rim of 5mm or greater, body weight greater than 10 kg, with clinical indications for surgical closure were considered for transcatheter closure. Follow-up investigations were performed at discharge, after 1, 3, 6 and 3 months, as well as after 1 and 2 years. Results: Of 78 patients considered for closure, a device was inserted in 41 patients (53%), with success being achieved in 40 patients (98%). The ages ranged from 1.1 to 15 years (7.8 +/- 1.92 years), the 'stretched' diameter of the defect from 10 to 20 mm (14.7 +/- 2.60 mm), and the diameters of the inserted devices from 25 to 45 mm (33.2 +/- 5.43 mm). Transient impairment of atrioventricular conduction occured in 4 patients. During the follow-up of 23.0 +/- 5.6 months elective surgical closure of a residual shunt was performed 26 months after insertion of the devcie in one patient. None of the other patients required surgery, hospitalisation or medical treatment, and none is requiring further treatment of the defect within the oval fossa. Fracture of one arn of the device occurred in 4 patients, bur the fractured arms are in an unchanged and stable position after a period of at least 19 months. Conclusions: Our medium-term data show that transcatheter closure in children of defects within the oval fossa can be performed with a high efficacy and safety using the ASDOS-device.","Med Hsch Hannover, Dept Pediat Cardiol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; Charite Berlin, Dept Pediat Cardiol, Berlin, Germany; Univ Essen Gesamthsch Klinikum, Dept Pediat Cardiol, D-4300 Essen, Germany; Univ Kiel, Dept Pediat Cardiol, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; Guys Hosp, Dept Pediat Cardiol, London SE1 9RT, England; Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Pediat Cardiol, Geneva, Switzerland","Hausdorf, G (reprint author), Med Hsch Hannover, Dept Pediat & Pediat Cardiol 3, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,29,12,13,0,0,GREENWICH MEDICAL MEDIA LTD,LONDON,"219 LINEN HALL, 162-168 REGENT ST, LONDON W1R 5TB, ENGLAND",1047-9511,,,CARDIOL YOUNG,Cardiol.

Osteogenic bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from 18-day-old embryonic chickens, while osteoclastic cells were isolated from laying White Leghorn hens on calcium-deficient diets. Osteoclastic cells (5 x 10(5)) were seeded onto mineral thin films and suspended above osteogenic cells (1 x 10(4)) already plated on the bottoms of tissue culture plate wells. The data showed that after 4 days of incubation there was up to a fivefold (P < 0.05) reduction in all measured parameters of osteogenesis (mineralization, alkaline phosphatase activity and type I collagen production) in osteogenic cultures grown in the presence of osteoclastic cells. Similarly, osteoclastic cell-induced mineral resorption was reduced up to threefold (P < 0.05), Go-culture effects on cellular responses could be manipulated by known antiresorptive agents (e.g., pamidronate) altering either the source or the age of osteoclastic cells.

Finally, the ability of FT-IRM to map new bone formed in implanted macroporous calcium phosphate biomaterial from sections was reported for the first time. FT-IRM allowed the correlation of the microstructure of bone formation in the in vivo model with modifications in carbonate and phosphate environments of the mineral phases during maturation. FT-IRM analysis on enamel sections revealed changes in the mineral environment of carbonate and phosphate ions and probably in the size of enamel crystals. These modifications contributed to the fragility of enamel in osteogenesis imperfecta. The infrared functional group imaging of a part of implanted biomaterial and the bone ingrowth provided the visualization of chemical modifications occurring in biomaterial implants at 20 mu m spatial resolution. The use of FT-IRM, in conjunction with appropriate sampling methods and data analysis should provide further insight into the molecular structure of mineral phases of calcified tissues and help to elucidate mineralization processes, skeletal disorders and properties of the biomaterials used as bone substitute.

The biofilm contains the capsular polysaccharide/adhesin (PS/A), which mediates cell adherence to biomaterials, and another antigen, termed polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is thought to mediate bacterial accumulation into cellular aggregates. PIA is a polymer of beta-1,6-linked N-acetyl glucosamine residues with a molecular mass of<30,000 kDa, We found that recombinant Staphylococcus carnosus and Staphylococcus aureus carrying a plasmid with genes of the ica locus, which was reported to encode the biosynthetic proteins for production of PIA, were also able to synthesize PS/A, PS/A and a chemically and immunologically identical polysaccharide isolated from S, carnosus carrying the ica genes on plasmid pCN27 were found to be high-molecular-mass (>250,000 kDa), acid-stable polymers of beta-1,6-linked glucosamine substituted on the amino group primarily with succinate, although some preparations also contained acetate, Moreover, all recombinant staphylococcal strains with the ica genes had the biologic properties previously attributed to PS/A, ica-positive strains readily formed an in vitro biofilm on plastic, adhered 3- to 10-fold more to catheters during a 30-min assay compared with control strains carrying only the cloning vector, adsorbed out antibodies to PS/A from immune serum, and elaborated a capsule visualized by immunoelectron microscopy with antisera to PS/A. These properties were also seen with PS/A-producing strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but not with transposon mutants lacking PS/A, An antiserum raised to PIA contained high-titer antibody to PS/A that was readily adsorbed out by PS/A-positive strains of S, epidermidis and recombinant strains of staphylococci carrying the ica genes. We conclude that the ica locus encodes production of PS/A and that the properties of S. epidermidis associated with initial bacterial adherence, biofilm formation, and intercellular adhesion can be correlated with elaboration of PS/A.","Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","McKenney, D (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Lab, 181 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",david.mckenney@channing.harvard.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI 23335],,,37,210,219,1,10,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,1098-5522,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

These polymers are A-B-type copolymers consisting of an alternating sequence of a diphenol and a diacid. The library was prepared by copolymerizing, in all possible combinations, 14 different tyrosine-derived diphenols and eight different aliphatic diacids, resulting in 8 x 14 = 112 distinct polymers. This approach (a) increases the number of available polymeric candidate materials for medical applications, and (b) facilitates the identification of correlations between polymer structure and glass transition temperature, air-water contact angle, mechanical properties, and fibroblast proliferation. The pendent chain and backbone structures were systematically varied by (a) simple homologative variations in the number of methylene groups, (b) substitution of oxygen for methylene groups, and (c) introduction of branched and aromatic structures. The polymers contained within the library exhibited incremental variations in T-g (from 2 degrees C to 91 degrees C) and air-water contact angle (from 64 degrees to 101 degrees). Fibroblast proliferation (in vitro, serum-containing media) ranged from approximating that measured on tissue culture polystyrene to complete absence of proliferation. Generally, decreased proliferation correlated linearly with increased surface hydrophobicity, except in those polymers derived from oxygen-containing diacids in their backbone which were uniformly good growth substrates even if their surfaces were very hydrophobic. In a selected subgroup of polymers, tensile strength of thin solvent cast films ranged from about 6 to 45 MPa, while Young's modulus (stiffness) ranged from about 0.3 to 1.7 Cpa. Combinatorial biomaterial libraries such as these tyrosine-derived polyarylates permit the systematic study of material-dependent biological responses and provide the medical device designer with the option to choose a suitable material from a library of related polymers that encompasses a broad range of properties.

However, natural coral transformed into calcite by heating has never been tested. The objective of this work was to study the proliferation and alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, and osteocalcin expression of human bone marrow cells cultured on CaCO3 crystallized both in the aragonite form (natural coral) and in the calcite form (natural coral modified by heating). The methods used to characterize calcite obtained from the coral were volumic porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction. Cell colonization of the material was assessed by SEM performed on days 1, 7, 20, and 30 and [H-3]thymidine incorporation was performed on days 3, 7, 12, 18, 25, and 32. Phenotypic expression was assessed by using in situ cytochemistry (alkaline phosphatase), immunocytochemistry (osteonectin and osteocalcin), and hybridization (osteocalcin, beta-actin, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA). Results showed the transformation of aragonite into calcite after heating, the conservation of macro-porosity, and a modification of the surface. Calcite appeared to have a smoother and more uniform surface than aragonite crystals. As for [H-3]thymidine there was an increase incorporation from days 3 to 18, a stabilization from days 18 to 25, and a decrease from days 25 to 32. After 20 days of culture, immunological studies using monoclonal antibodies to osteocalcin, osteonectin, cytochemical analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity, and in situ hybridization using osteocalcin, beta-actin, and alkaline phosphatase cDNA indicated that the cells had not lost their osteoblastic phenotype. These experiments demonstrate that coral crystallized in the aragonite or calcite form present a similar degree of specific cytocompatibility.

Contacting platelets were quantitatively more active, with motions including rolling, detachment, oscillatory vibration, and change of direction only on the HEMA-St block copolymer surface. Active platelet movements were observed for long time periods (>20 min) on HEMA-St block copolymer surfaces and were distinct from those for inert PSt latex particles on these same surfaces, demonstrating that platelet movements were not due to physical forces such as convection, hydrophobic interactions, or microbrownian movement. To study the cause and mechanism underlying the platelet movements, platelets treated with an adenosine triphosphate (Am) synthesis inhibition, NaN3, or a membrane skeleton-disrupting chemical agent, dibucaine, were also studied on these surfaces. Both treatments reduced platelet movement and demonstrated that platelets in contact with the HEMA-St block copolymer surface require metabolic processes consuming ATP and involve dynamics of their membrane skeleton. These energy-consuming active movements might explain the previously observed lower platelet activation and low thrombogenicity of the HEMA-St block copolymers. Enhanced platelet movements on the HEMA-St block copolymer surface show that the microdomain surface interacts uniquely with platelets to hinder activation and preserve passive platelet function despite surface contact.

To understand the importance of discrete biomaterial chemical characteristics in modifying host tissue responses, we constructed surfaces bearing different functional groups using radio frequency glow discharge plasma polymerization. Surfaces evaluated included those having high concentrations of -OH, -NH2, -CF3, and siloxyl groups. These surfaces and polyethylene terephthalate controls were used to assess the importance of particular physicochemical characteristics in surface:protein:cell interactions both in vitro and in vivo. The results obtained show that surface functionalities do significantly affect both the adsorption and ""denaturation"" of adsorbed fibrinogen (which is an important mediator of inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants). In addition, these surfaces provoke different degrees of acute inflammatory responses. Interestingly, the amounts of ""denatured"" fibrinogen that spontaneously accumulate on the individual surfaces correlate closely with the extent of biomaterial-mediated inflammation. These results suggest that surfaces that tend to ""irreversibly"" bind fibrinogen prompt greater acute inflammatory responses. Unexpectedly, all test surfaces except those bearing a siloxyl group engender relatively similar biomaterial-mediated fibrotic responses. Thus surface functionalities alone may not be sufficient to affect subsequent fibrotic responses.

The properties of the hardened HAp bodies were characterized by measuring compressive strength and X-ray diffraction, The compressive strength of the hardened bodies depended on the amount of DCPD, types of carboxylic acids, concentrations of carboxylic acid solutions, water/solid weight ratios, aging time and temperature. Particularly, the type of carboxylic acid considerably influenced the compressive strength. For example, utilization of glycine as a carboxylic acid showed a value of 5.5 MPa in compressive strength at maximum although that of maric acid showed a value of only 3.0 MPa.

This increase in cost and morbidity has been associated with several epidemiological trends that map contribute to access failure. These include late patient referral to nephrologists and surgeons, late planning of vascular access as well as a shift from A-V fistulaes to PTFE grafts and temporary catheters, which have a higher failure rate. The reasons for this shift in the types of access is multifactorial and is not explained by changes in the co-morbidities of patients presenting to dialysis. Surgical preference and training also appear to play an important role in the large regional variation and patency rate of these PTFE grafts. We propose a program for early placement of A-V fistulae, a continuous quality improvement, multidisciplinary program to monitor access outcome, the development of new biomaterials, and a research plan to investigate pharmacological intervention to reduce development of stenosis and clinical interventions to treat those that do develop, prior to thrombosis.","Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Nashville, TN USA; Maine Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Portland, ME 04102 USA","Hakim, R (reprint author), Renal Care Grp Inc, 2100 W End Ave,Suite 800, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R01-HL36015-12]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK45610-05],,,102,209,215,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0085-2538,,,KIDNEY INT,Kidney Int.,OCT,1998.0,54,4,,,,,1029,1040,,10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.00122.x,,,,12,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,122XN,WOS:000076096900001,9767519.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

The toxicological effects of dental alloys depend mainly on their element specific corrosion behaviour in the oral cavity. The present study demonstrates the electrochemical boundary conditions regarding the possible formation of AgCl-corrosion products, for which cytotoxic effects has been established, by means of specially adapted electrochemical in-vitro test programs. The prevalence of the developed corrosion mode was proved for two electrolytes and four daily used dental alloys containing different amounts of silver. The results show, that a biological relevant assessment of the released silver ions in both electrolytes, induced by anodic metal dissolution, is only reliable if the measurement takes into account the silver ions within the electrolyte as well as the superficial immobilized amount of silver chloride corrosion products. Thus especially from a biological point of view, interface processes like the formation of immobilized corrosion products seem to be a relevant parameter for the complete testing of biocompatibility of metallic biomaterials. To sum up it can be concluded, that the dental alloys investigated in the course of this study have not shown any adverse susceptibility to corrosion with respect to the clinical practice and can therefore be classified as well biocompatible.","Inst Bioproc & Analyt Measurement Tech eV, Dept Biomat Rosenhof, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany","Hildebrand, G (reprint author), Inst Bioproc & Analyt Measurement Tech eV, Dept Biomat Rosenhof, D-37308 Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0947-5117,1521-4176,,MATER CORROS,Mater.

MAD carries a maleimide function for thermochemical modification of thiolated molecules and a diazirine function that is lost during light activation (350 nm light). Photoactivation leads to carbene-mediated grafting to solid supports. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy atomic constituents and chemical shifts, as well as ToF-SIMS molecular peaks and characteristic fragments of the photoimmobilized molecule, are identified. Extended interpretation of surface analysis data suggests that diamond is the substrate with the highest MAD grafting efficiency and that the formation of C-O bonds upon diazirine photoactivation is involved.

The mechanism of permeability control for caffeine and vitamin B-12 through composite-MPG membranes was determined to be a synergistic function of membrane hydration and the percolating volume fraction of PMAA gel. Larger changes in permeation as a function of pH were achieved when both hydration and percolation effects occurred together than when either of these effects occurred on their own. Vitamin B-12 permeation was observed when the hydrated gel volume fraction was above approximately 0.38, but not below. Furthermore, the percolating fraction of composite-MPG membranes containing 28% (dry basis) PMAA gel particles was manipulated via pH to fall above (pH 7) or below (pH 3) this transition in permeability, resulting in membranes that delivered solutes of high molecular weight (vitamin B12) With large on/off delivery ratios (160).

A similar bioactive material, BioGran (OV) (Orthovita, Malvern, PA), was developed to limit the particle size of 45S5 to the range between 300 and 360 mu m, as determined by sieving. The objective of this study was to histologically and biomechanically compare the 4585 bioactive glass, produced by US Biomaterials, in a wide particle range (USB) to the narrower particle range glass produced by Orthovita (OV). The grafted defects will then be compared to normal cancellous bone (NORM) of the distal femur in rabbits. Histologically, more bone was quantified at both 4 and 12 weeks within the defects filled with USE and NORM when compared to the Limbs filled with OV (p < 0.05). The OV particles had greater particle axes and larger particle areas on average than the USE particles (p < 0.05). However, the particle axis and area of the two materials decreased with time at a similar rate.

After 17 h of attachment, the bacteria demonstrated an increased resistance to amikacin compared with their free-floating counterparts. Amikacin, even at a concentration exceeding 150 times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the strain tested, did not eradicate the attached bacteria from the surface of collagen membrane. However, when the drug at a high concentration (over 16 times the minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC) was present in the incubation medium before it had been inoculated with P. aeruginosa, a reduction of 2 log(10) units in the organisms adherent to the surface of collagen membrane was observed. We conclude that slow release of the antibiotic from the COLL dressing could control.ol the bacterial colonization on the surface. In fact, the released amikacin at the final concentration of 32 times the MBC reduced the number of adherent bacteria by 6 log(10) units. in contrast, ciprofloxacin at the same final bactericidal concentration completely eradicated the bacteria from the surface of COLL dressing. However, as ciprofloxacin is not recommended for use as a topical antimicrobial agent, a further search is needed to find an agent with a similar anticolonization activity.

The static contact angle data reveal that the higher hard-segment-content SPEU material possesses a lower contact angle, implying that the surface of the higher hard-segment-content SPEU is more hydrophilic than its low hard-segment-content SPEU counterpart. The catalyst- and additive-free PTMO-based SPEU materials in this study possess neither a hemolytic nor a cytotoxic response that could be considered non toxic for biomedical applications. By using L-929 cell lines, a cell-seeding test indicated that the higher hard-segment-content SPEU material possesses quicker cell attachment and proliferation behaviors. In vitro platelet adhesion tests indicated that the lower hard-segment-content SPEU possesses less platelet adhesion than the high hard-segment-content SPEU material. Both ex vivo canine artery-artery (A-A) and arterio-venous (A-V) shunting tests revealed that the extent of platelet adhesion reaction is less for lower hard-segment-content SPEU.

The human osteoblast-Like cell Line MG63 was grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) and P2O5 glass-reinforced HA composite discs and compared with the same cells grown on polystyrene culture dishes. While morphological observation at the light and electron microscopic levels showed no major deleierious effects, FCM indicated that cell size was somewhat reduced, particularly by growth on the HA composite. Moreover, this material also appeared to delay the progression of the cells from the G0/G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle. In addition to this low level of inhibition of cell growth relative to control cultures, FCM analysis also demonstrated that the glass-reinforced HA caused some down-regulation of the expression of osteocalcin and fibronectin, two antigens which play a vital part in the integrity and function of bone and soft connective tissue, respectively. These results thus show, first, that although HA and the HA composite used in these experiments were generally biocompatible, they nevertheless had certain suboptimal effects on the cells; and second, that FCM could be a highly useful procedure for effectively screening and evaluating important biological responses to implant materials.

Platelets rapidly generate thrombin when they are in the procoagulant state and the Va/Xa complex is present. We found that adherent platelets are procoagulant by three different methods: binding of FITC-Annexin V, acceleration of thrombin generation in the presence of Xa, Va, and prothrombin; and clotting of recalcified plasma. in the clotting time studies, the effect of adherent platelets on TCPS was completely eliminated by the addition of Annexin V, which is known to bind tightly to procoagulant platelets. The degree of procoagulant activity of adherent platelets was determined by measuring thrombin generation rates in the presence of the clotting factors Va, Xa, and prothrombin and normalizing to the number of adherent platelets. Two key observations were made in these studies. First, the procoagulant activity of platelets adherent to untreated and to several types of treated polystyrenes, as well as to glass and PET, was much greater than the procoagulant activity of unstimulated bulk phase platelets. Little difference in the procoagulant activity of adherent platelets was observed among the materials tested, however. Second, the procoagulant activity of platelets prestimulated with ionophore and subsequently allowed to adhere to Plastek(R) M was much greater than when adherent platelets were stimulated by the adhesion event only. Measured values for platelet adhesion, platelet activation, and contact activation of blood plasma are discussed in the context of their potential combined impact on blood clotting.

In this study, we have prepared model surfaces with different functional groups to provide a range of surface wettability and charge. The cellular responses of attachment, spreading, and cytoskeletal organization have been studied following preadsorption of these surfaces with dilute serum, specific serum proteins, and individual components of the extracellular matrix. When preadsorbed with dilute serum, cell attachment, spreading, and cytoskeletal organization were significantly greater on hydrophilic surfaces relative to hydrophobic surfaces. Among the hydrophilic surfaces, differences in charge and wettability influenced cell attachment but not cell area, shape, or cytoskeletal organization. Moderately hydrophilic surfaces (20-40 degree water contact angle) promoted the highest levels of cell attachment. Preadsorption of the model surfaces with bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in a pattern of cell attachment very similar to that observed following preadsorption with dilute serum, suggesting an important role for BSA in regulating cell attachment to biomaterials exposed to complex biological media.

This study reports the evaluation of the in vivo tissue response to these polymers in comparison to poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). Typically, the biocompatibility of a material is determined through histological evaluations as a function of implantation time in a suitable animal model. However, due to changes that can occur in the tissue response at different stages of the degradation process, a fixed set of time points is not ideal for comparative evaluations of materials having different rates of degradation. Therefore the tissue response elicited by poly(DTE carbonate), poly(DTE adipate), and PLLA was evaluated as a function of molecular weight. This allowed the tissue response to be compared at corresponding stages of degradation. Poly(DTE adipate) consistently elicited the mildest tissue response, as judged by the width and lack of cellularity of the fibrous capsule formed around the implant. The tissue response to poly(DTE carbonate) was mild throughout the 570 day study. However, the response to PLLA fluctuated as a function of the degree of degradation, exhibiting an increase in the intensity of inflammation as the implant began to lose mass. At the completion of the study, tissue ingrowth into the degrading and disintegrating poly(DTE adipate) implant was evident while no comparative ingrowth of tissue was seen far PLLA. The similarity of the in vivo and in vitro degradation rates of each polymer confirmed the absence of enzymatic involvement in the degradation process. A comparison of molecular weight retention, water uptake, and mass loss in vivo with two commonly used in vitro systems [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and simulated body fluid (SBF)] demonstrated that for the two tyrosine-derived polymers the in vivo results were equally well simulated in vitro with PBS and SBF;. However, for PLLA the in vivo results were better simulated in vitro using PBS.

Thermal shape memory, superelasticity, and high damping properties make such alloys behave differently compared to other implant metals. There has previously been a lack of sufficient evidence on the biocompatibility of Nitinol. The purpose of this study was to evaluate general soft tissue response and biocompatibility to Nitinol in vivo, and to clarify neural and perineural responses, previously unreported. Seventy-five rats were randomized into three groups. Test specimens were implanted into paravertebral muscle and near the sciatic nerve. A comparison was made between Nitinol, stainless steel, and Ti-6Al-4V. The animals were euthanized at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks after implantation. General morphologic and histologic observations were made under light microscopy Semiautomatic computerized image analysis was used to measure the encapsule membrane thickness around the implants. The muscular tissue response to Nitinol was clearly nontoxic, regardless of the time period. The overall inflammatory response to Nitinol was very similar to that of stainless steel and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. There were no necroses, granulomas, or signs of dystrophic soft tissue calcification. The immune cell response to Nitinol remained low. Only a few foreign-body giant cells were present. The detected neural and perineural responses were also clearly nontoxic and nonirritating with Nitinol. No qualitative differences in histology between the different test materials could be seen. At 8 weeks, the encapsule membrane of Nitinol was thicker than that of stainless steel (mean 62 +/- 25 mu m vs. 41 +/- 8 mu m) At the end of the study, the encapsule thickness was equal to all the materials tested. We concluded that Nitinol had good in vivo biocompatibility after intramuscular and perineural implantation in rats in the 26-week follow-up. Based on the results of the present study, Nitinol appears to have good potential for clinical use.

It was named sublancin 168, and its behavior during Edman sequence analysis and its NMR spectrum suggested that sublancin is a dehydroalanine-containing lantibiotic, A hybridization probe based on the peptide sequence was used to clone the presublancin gene, which encoded a 56-residue polypeptide consisting of a 19-residue leader segment and a 37-residue mature segment. The mature segment contained one serine, one threonine, and five cysteine residues. Alkylation of mature sublancin showed no free sulfhydryl groups, suggesting that one sulfydryl had formed a beta-methyllanthionine bridge with a dehydrobutyrine derived by posttranslational modification of threonine; with the other four cysteines forming two disulfide bridges. It is unprecedented for a lantibiotic to contain a disulfide bridge. The sublancin leader was similar to known type AII lantibiotics, containing a double-glycine motif that is typically recognized by dual-function transporters. A protein encoded immediately downstream from the sublancin gene possessed features of a dual-function ABC transporter with a proteolytic domain and an ATP-binding domain. The antimicrobial activity spectrum of sublancin was like other lantibiotics, inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria; and like the lantibiotics nisin and subtilin in its ability to inhibit both bacterial spore outgrowth and vegetative growth. Sublancin is an extraordinarily stable lantibiotic, showing no degradation or inactivation after being stored in aqueous solution at room temperature for 2 years. The fact that sublancin is a natural product of B. subtilis 168, for which a great deal of genetic information is available, including the entire sequence of its genome, suggests that sublancin will be an especially good model for studying the potential of lantibiotics as sources of novel biomaterials.","Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Hansen, JN (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI24454],,,35,149,168,0,25,AMER SOC BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY INC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0021-9258,,,J BIOL CHEM,J.

These cements consist of dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD), alpha-tricalcium phosphate, or amorphous calcium phosphate and, as an additional source of calcium, calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate. These cements require the use of a phosphate (0.2 mol l(-1) or higher) solution or a high pH solution as the cement liquid. The cements harden in relatively short time (5-30 min) and form HA as the dominant end-product in 24 h. The diametral tensile strengths of the 24-h samples are in the range of 0.2 to 7.5 MPa. Results from X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the cement setting is caused by rapid HA formation induced by the high phosphate concentration of the cement liquid. Because DCPA and DCPD are highly soluble at pH values above 12.7, which is the pK(3) of phosphoric acid, high phosphate concentration in the slurry solution was also attainable by using a highly alkaline solution as the cement liquid. The physicochemical properties of these cements are comparable to those of TTCP-containing cements, and the new cements may be expected to have in vivo characteristics similar to those of TTCP-containing cements as well.

These attractive properties were a driving force for the early introduction of alpha (cpTi) and alpha + beta (Ti-6A1-4V) alloys as well as for the more recent development of new Ti-alloy compositions and orthopaedic metastable beta titanium alloys. The later possess enhanced biocompatibility, reduced elastic modulus, and superior strain-controlled and notch fatigue resistance. However, the poor shear strength and wear resistance of titanium alloys have nevertheless limited their biomedical use. Although the wear resistance of beta-Ti alloys has shown some improvement when compared to alpha + beta alloys, the ultimate utility of orthopaedic titanium alloys as wear components will require a more complete fundamental understanding of the wear mechanisms involved. This review examines current information on the physical and mechanical characteristics of titanium alloys used in artifical joint replacement prostheses, with a special focus on those issues associated with the long-term prosthetic requirements, e.g., fatigue and wear.

The cytotoxicities of this hydrogel, two semi-occlusive polyurethane dressings (Tegaderm and OpSite), and a hydrocolloid dressing (DuoDERM) were compared by measuring cell survival with the tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT) assay after incubations of the wound dressing samples for up to 6 d, in the presence of-but not in direct contact with-the cells. In vitro, the degree of cytotoxicity of the new hydrogel was greater in keratinocyte cultures than in fibroblast and endothelial cell cultures, and increased upon longer incubation time. In keratinocyte cultures, the semi-occlusive polyurethane dressings, the hydrocolloid, and the hydrogel dressings induced low, high and acceptable degrees of cytotoxicity, respectively. The toxicity of the isolated hydrogel components was assessed in Balb MK keratinocyte cultures. In these cells, epidermal growth-factor-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA was higher in the presence of gelatin. By contrast, concentrations of dextran dialdehyde as low as 0.002% were found to significantly decrease thymidine incorporation (P < 0.01). Subcutaneous implantation studies in mice showed that in vivo the hydrogel was biocompatible since the foreign body reaction seen around the implanted hydrogel samples was moderate and became minimal upon increasing implantation time. These results indicate that dextran dialdehyde cross-linked gelatin hydrogels have an appropriate biocompatibility. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

We hypothesized that different surface compositions of stent material could result in different conditioning film depositions and potentially altered receptivity to bacterial biofilms, Using XPS, three types of ureteral stents recovered from 64 patients were found to have adsorbed conditioning films that altered the surface composition of the devices. Elements associated with encrustation (calcium, magnesium and phosphorus) were found on 69% of the silicone latex stents, 44% of the low surface energy (LSe) devices, and 38% of the carbon-rich stents, No statistical difference was found in relation to patient gender, stent type, duration of implantation, and encrustation deposition. The composition of the film suggested that the nature of the underlying material did not significantly alter the elements that adsorbed. Thus, devices may take on a similar surface coat within days, and perhaps hours, of exposure to the host. With respect to dense encrustations, fewer appeared on the LSe devices. SEM confirmed the presence and nature of the film crystals and showed bacterial biofilms adherent to devices and encrustations in three patients who had received prophylactic trimethoprim compared to one on ciprofloxacin, In conclusion, although encrustation deposition and biofilm formation on ureteral stents is not unique to Cook devices, the human model and surface science test systems described here are invaluable to evaluate biomaterials used in patients, Unless biomaterials undergo rigorous analysis in vivo, including true assessment of the outcome of prophylactic antibiotic usage, clinicians will be unable to accurately select the best device and management strategy for a given patient.

Polyethylene implants induced a much stronger foreign-body reaction than titanium implants, as measured by the number of interfacial ED1-positive macrophages. The tissue response to titanium and polyethylene was also vastly different in arthritic synovial tissue compared with control tissue. It is likely that these biomaterials interact differently with inflammatory cells or intermediary compounds.

The mandibular premolars and the Ist, 2nd and 3rd maxillary premolars were extracted. Three fixtures of the Branemark System(R) were installed in each mandibular quadrant (a total of 6 fixtures per animal). Abutment connection was performed after 3 months of healing. In each dog the following types of abutments were used: 2 ""control abutments"" (c.p. titanium), 2 ""ceramic abutments"" (highly sintered Al2O3), 1 ""gold abutment"", and 1 ""short titanium abutment"". This ""short titanium abutment"" was provided with an outer structure made of dental porcelain fused to gold. Following abutment connection a plaque control program was initiated and maintained for 6 months. The animals were sacrificed and perfused with a fixative. The mandibles were removed and each implant region was dissected, demineralized in EDTA and embedded in EPON(R). Semithin sections representing the mesial, distal, buccal and lingual aspects of the peri-implant tissues were produced and subjected to histological examination. The findings from the analysis demonstrated that the material used in the abutment portion of the implant influenced the location and the quality of the attachment that occurred between the periimplant mucosa and the implant. Abutments made of c.p. titanium or ceramic allowed the formation of a mucosal attachment which included one epithelial and one connective tissue portion that were about 2 mm and 1 - 1.5 mm high, respectively. At sites where abutments made of gold alloy or dental porcelain were used, no proper attachment formed at the abutment level, but the soft tissue margin receded and bone resorption occurred. The abutment fixture junction was hereby occasionally exposed and the mucosal barrier became established to the fixture portion of the implant. It was suggested that the observed differences were the result of varying adhesive properties of the materials studied or by variations in their resistance to corrosion.","Univ Goteborg, Inst Odontol, Dept Periodontol, SE-40530 Goteborg, Sweden; Univ Lund, Dept Prosthodont, Lund, Sweden","Abrahamsson, I (reprint author), Univ Goteborg, Inst Odontol, Dept Periodontol, Box 450, SE-40530 Goteborg, Sweden.",,,,,,,28,267,268,1,15,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0303-6979,,,J CLIN PERIODONTOL,J.

Despite the importance of the interaction between these organized assemblies and the surface of biomaterials, little is known about the mechanism involved. In this study, the interaction between giant proline-rich mussel adhesive protein (MAP) vesicles and the microporous apatite surface was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We have found that MAP vesicles incubated on the apatite surface similar to osteoclasts, induce site-specific resorption of the apatite surface. However, in contrast to the osteoclastic resorption, the vesicle-induced resorption process appears to be accompanied by an organic matrix-mediated remineralization process. This results in the formation of a variety of complex three-dimensional site-specific ""remodelled zones"" on the apatite surface of micrometre scale. The mechanism of the formation of ""remodelled zones"" is discussed in terms of surface phenomena, such as adsorption and deformation of vesicles, site-specific release of resorptive agents, organic matrix-directed remineralization, and Ca-induced fusion, collapse and reshaping of the vesicles on the apatite surface.","Queens Univ, Dept Mat & Met Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Shirkhanzadeh, M (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Mat & Met Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",,,,,,,35,1,1,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Each patient received daily antibiotic therapy with either ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim. After removal; the devices were analyzed for adherent bacteria and encrustations. The study showed that a conditioning film became deposited onto the stents upon implantation, changing the surface characteristics of the biomaterials. Dense encrustations were found to be least on a low surface energy device. No differences were found related to patient age and gender or duration of stent insertion. Flakiness and apparent sloughing of the stent surfaces was observed in some devices, raising concerns as to what actually happens to medical devices when exposed to the host urinary tract. Bacteria were recovered from the urine of three patients and the stents of four patients treated with trimethoprim. Five stents had bacterial biofilms detected by SEM. The actual clinical end-point was not the focus of this study, but no patients became septic. Our goal was to demonstrate conclusively in humans that medical devices do develop conditioning films upon implantation, and that they can be susceptible to bacterial colonization even during antibiotic treatments. The kidneys of stented patients are clearly at risk of infection, and only by proper selection of a stent type and appropriate antibiotic coverage can this risk be significantly reduced.","Lawson Res Inst H414, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Surg, Div Urol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada","Reid, G (reprint author), Lawson Res Inst H414, 268 Grosvenor St, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada.",,,,,,,22,34,34,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0022-5347,,,J UROLOGY,J.

The present short review article shows that under normal circumstances structural 'damage' precedes the creation of a fatal macrocrack and the onset of 'failure'. The externally perceived material 'toughness' is a function of both: (i) the degree of prefailure accumulation of damage and (ii) of the properties of the final fracture surface. These two situations can be distinguished as 'pre-fracture' toughness and 'fracture toughness' and the relative contribution of each one in the overall toughness of the tissue is crucial for the final outcome of the failure process. Inevitably, materials which show remarkable toughness have to enhance their performance with respect to both the previous two defined quantities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

To date, several methods to count the number of colloidal gold labels have been employed with limited success. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), a physical method for the analysis of the elemental composition of materials, can be used to provide a quantitative index of gold accumulation in bulk specimens. Given that gold is not naturally found in biological specimens in any substantial amount and that colloidal gold and ligand conjugates can be prepared to yield uniform bead sizes, the amount of label can be calculated in bulk biological samples by INAA. Here we describe the use of INAA, LM, transmission EM, and X-ray microanalysis (EDX) in a model to determine both distribution (localization) and amount of colloidal gold at the organ, tissue, cellular, and ultrastructural levels in whole animal systems following administration. In addition, the sensitivity for gold in biological specimens by INAA is compared with that of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The correlative use of INAA, LM, TEM, and EDX can be useful, for example, in the quantitative and qualitative tracking of various labeled molecular species following administration in vivo.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anim Hlth & Biomed Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Albrecht, RM (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anim Hlth & Biomed Sci, 1656 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Hillyer, Julian/0000-0002-3178-0201",,,,41,46,47,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1431-9276,1435-8115,,MICROSC MICROANAL,Microsc. microanal.,SEP-OCT,1998.0,4,5,,,,,481,490,,10.1017/S143192769898045X,,,,10,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Microscopy",Materials Science; Microscopy,166XZ,WOS:000078604400003,,,,,2019-02-25

The patterned immobilization of EGF on the polystyrene plate was confirmed by immunostaining with an anti-EGF antibody. Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing EGF receptors were cultured on the micropatterned plate. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues of EGF receptors and signal proteins were detected only in the cells adhered in the EGF-immobilized area and cell growth was observed only in the EGF-immobilized area. The cells growing in the EGF-immobilized area were partially stained by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, when the area of EGF immobilization was smaller than the cell. The partial staining of activated proteins indicates that immobilization of the EGF inhibited the free lateral diffusion and internalization of the activated EGF/EGF-receptor complex.

At this time, though, there are no consensus safety or efficacy standards for tissue-engineered products. We describe general approaches for assessment of the safety and efficacy of cell-based tissue-engineered products which will lead to reliable medical products for human use. This article provides a general summary of the factors that should be considered in the design and development of cell- and tissue-based products. Seven areas are considered: cell and tissue sourcing; cell and tissue characterization; biomaterials testing; quality assurance; quality control; and nonclinical testing and clinical evaluation. Factors relevant to these areas have been discussed to provide a set of recommendations on which development of products can be standardized. Where relevant, the discussion has been separated in each area to issues that are independent or dependent on cell source. Also, examples are provided of how these guidelines would be applied to two product types that represent somewhat extreme ends of the spectrum for tissue engineering applications. The first example is a product whose mechanism of action is to provide locally-acting structural repair or enhancement in vivo. The second example is a product whose mechanism of action involves systemically distributed physiologically or pharmacologically active products. In general, we have limited the discussion of product types to those that are implanted into the patient for relatively long periods of time. We believe that adoption of these voluntary guidelines would lead to products that are more consistent in quality and performance as well as more rapidly developed.","Reprogenesis Inc, Cambridge, MA 01239 USA; CytoTherapeut Inc, Lincoln, RI USA; Med Commun, New Haven, CT USA; Genzyme Tissue Repair, Cambridge, MA USA; IPS, Bridgewater, NJ USA",,,,,,,,54,23,24,0,3,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC PUBL,LARCHMONT,"2 MADISON AVENUE, LARCHMONT, NY 10538 USA",1076-3279,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,FAL,1998.0,4,3,,,,,239,266,,10.1089/ten.1998.4.239,,,,28,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,126ZC,WOS:000076324400002,9836789.0,,,,2019-02-25

These cells are known to be progenitors of osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, and reticulocytes. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, a marker of the osteoblast phenotype, was increased by a factor of two- to sixfold on carbonated apatite, one- to sixfold on apatite and three- to 10-fold on calcium-deficient apatite, over levels observed on plastic. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced. Photomicroscopic examination indicated high biocompatibility with close adhesion of the bone marrow fibroblastic cells to composites D, F, and H. Longer term marrow cultures (15 days) confirmed the stimulation of cell differentiation, as assessed by collagen production, over cell proliferation, of cells grown on carbonated apatite. Enhanced osteoblastic differentiation was observed on a 70% carbonated apatite, which has a composition similar to bone mineral, whereas cell toxicity was observed on cells grown on amorphous calcium phosphate. This in vitro human bone marrow fibroblast culture system provides a simple and effective method for the evaluation of new biomaterials.

When the ice formation is complete, further lowering of temperature makes the relaxation slower; art effect attributed to temperature itself as distinct from change of phase. As the temperature lowers, more ice forms and the material behaves more brittle, decreasing the failure strains. The compressive and tensile failure strength increases with drop in temperature.

The experimental data suggest that the distal ends of the (adsorbed) fibrinogen molecule (containing polymerisation sites) are oriented anti-parallel to each other, proving off-axis location of the distal end domains.

Many of the difficulties could be because of problems in isolating electrochemical effects from other interactions of phase components. We explored charge effects on protein partitioning in poly(ethylene glycol)-dextran two-phase systems by using two series of genetically engineered charge modifications of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme produced in Escherichia coli. The two series, one in the form of charged-fusion tails and the other in the form of charge-change point mutations, provided matching net charges but very different polarity. Partition coefficients of both series were obtained and interfacial potential differences of the phase systems were measured. Multi-angle laser light scattering measurements were also performed to determine second virial coefficients. A semi-empirical model accounting for the roles of both charge and non-charge effects on protein partitioning behavior is proposed, and the results predicted from the model are compared to the results from the experiments.

This system also provides an opportunity to elucidate the relationship between protein-protein molecular recognition, crystallization solution conditions, and crystal properties such as coherence, space group symmetry, and morphology. A better understanding of these relationships may aid in the design of rational strategies for promoting high-quality protein crystallization and for controlling protein assembly at interfaces in the biomaterials and nanotechnology fields. Here we show that two-dimensional streptavidin crystallization is kinetically controlled and that formation of a single electrostatic interaction at the crystal contact interfaces is a key energetic determinant of the kinetic barriers controlling crystal morphology. Our results also demonstrate that this electrostatic interaction at the streptavidin protein-protein interfaces is responsible for the ionic strength dependence of streptavidin crystallization. Molecular modeling studies of the wild-type crystal that displays C222 symmetry suggested that the side-chain amines of lysine 132 from adjacent proteins interact with each other across the dyad-related crystal contacts. Leucine was substituted at this position (K132L) to remove the need for bridging counterions. Unlike wild-type streptavidin, the K132L mutant crystallizes with rectangular morphology on buffer or on a pure water subphase and analysis of the electron micrographs demonstrates that the crystal retains C222 symmetry in the presence or absence of salt. The kinetic barriers associated with formation of this electrostatic interaction thus underlie the wild-type butterfly crystal morphology.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Biol Struct, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Biomol Struct Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Stayton, PS (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Box 357962, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Vogel, Viola/O-8025-2015","Vogel, Viola/0000-0003-2898-7671",,,,28,22,23,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,AUG 18,1998.0,14,17,,,,,4683,4687,,10.1021/la9801918,,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,112GD,WOS:000075485000003,,,,,2019-02-25

Separations are often by size, ion exchange, or hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of the support, eluent and protein. Adsorption of a protein to a synthetic surface plays an essential role in this complex process. In this study, we examined the adsorption properties of three representative plasma proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulin G) on nonporous column materials containing either quaternary amine or sulfopropyl functional groups. The adsorption properties were studied at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. Salt gradients were used to examine the adsorption/desorption properties of each of the proteins on each type of surface. The salt concentrations at desorption were measured and compared to the protein isoelectric points. In addition, we examined protein recoveries as a function of desorption time. Our results suggest that protein recoveries depend not only on the protein, eluent and surface, but also the residence time and overall charge concentration during the initial adsorption process. Finally, we correlated the number of charge sites on a molecule with the width of a chromatographic band at half height. The data produced as a result of this study may be used to determine the actual unfolding time of a protein, given a certain set of conditions. The data may also help in understanding the chemistry and dynamics of the protein adsorption processes in ion-exchange chromatography as well as provide key structural information about the proteins.

The incorporation of achiral units into collagen-like structures is of considerable interest for the structural simplification of collagen-like biomaterials. The achiral unit Gly-Nleu-Nleu (where Nleu represents N-isobutylglycine) was positioned between Gly-Pro-Hyp trimeric repeats in collagen-like structures in order to examine the effect of an achiral block on triple helicity. A series of single chain structures, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(n)-(Gly-Pro-Kyp)(n)-NH2 (where n = 1-3), and a template-assembled structure, KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(2)-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-NH2](3) (where KTA represents cis,cis-1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid), were investigated. Biophysical studies were carried out in both H2O and ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O (2:1, v/v) solvents, using circular dichroism and optical rotation measurements. Highly cooperative melting curves from optical rotation determinations were obtained for Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n)-(Gly-Nleu-Nieu)(n)- (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n)-NH2 (n = 2, 3) and KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(2)-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-NH2](3), revealing that the achiral trimer can participate in triple helical structures. These results were also supported by circular dichroism spectroscopy. For the molecules Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(3)(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 and KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(2)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(2)-NH2](3), the presence of collagen-like structures was also supported by H-1 NMR spectroscopy in H2O. For each structure, a distinct set of resonances, obtained at low temperature, disappeared once a thermal denaturation temperature was reached. Furthermore, the analysis of NOE cross-peaks established the close packing of Pro, Hyp, and Nleu. The spatial proximity of Pro and Nleu residues and of Hyp and Nleu residues belonging to different chains was confirmed by molecular modeling of triple helical AC-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-(Gly-Nleu-Nleu)(3)-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)(3)-NH2 .","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biochem & Chem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Goodman, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biochem & Chem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,38,27,27,2,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Thin HA films up to 1 mu m thick were deposited on silicon wafers coated either with borophosphate silicate glass (BPSG) or titanium films, dried and then fired. Increasing the drying temperature raised the firing temperature for initial formation of crystalline HA. It was found that at firing temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 degrees C, the dominant phase in the powders was HA with small amounts of calcium oxide and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP). As the firing temperature increased the amount of CaO and beta-TCP increased. At firing temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 degrees C the only observable crystalline phase in the films was HA.

The implantation of polymer/cell constructs combines concepts of biomaterials and cell transplantation. The interconnections between the host responses to the biomaterial and transplanted cells determines the biocompatibility of the device. This review describes the inflammatory response to the biomaterial component and immune response towards transplanted cells. Emphasis is on how the presence of the transplanted cell construct affects the host response. The inflammatory response towards a biomaterial can impact the immune response towards transplanted cells and vice versa. Immune rejection is the most important host response towards the cellular component of tissue engineered devices containing allogeneic, xenogeneic or immunogenic ex vivo manipulated autologous cells. The immune mechanisms towards allografts and xenografts are outlined to provide a basis for the mechanistic hypotheses of the immune response towards encapsulated cells, with antigen shedding and the indirect pathway of antigen presentation predominating.

Thrombin, which is responsible for thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell activation, has been the target of numerous surface modification strategies in an effort to prevent this phenomenon from occurring. The purpose of this study was to covalently immobilize the potent, specific antithrombin agent recombinant hirudin (rHir) onto a novel polyurethane polymer synthesized with carboxylic acid groups which served as protein attachment sites. The in vitro efficacy of thrombin inhibition by this novel biomaterial surface was then evaluated. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was selected as the basecoat protein, was reacted with sulfo-SMCC in a 1:50 molar ratio. This BSA-SMCC complex was then covalently linked to the carboxylated polyurethane (cPU) surface via the crosslinker EDC (cPU-BSA-SMCC). This cPU-BSA-SMCC surface was then reacted with Traut's-modified I-125-rHir, a procedure which created free sulfhydryl groups on rHir (cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir). Using these crosslinking procedures, the cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir segments bound 188 +/- 40 ng/cm(2) (n = 60) whereas the controls with non-specifically bound I-125-rHir (Mitrathan + EDC + BSA + I-125-rHir-SH and cPU-BSA + I-125-rHir-SH) bound 13 +/- 8 ng/cm(2) and 4 +/- 8 ng/cm(2), respectively. Evaluation of these cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir segments for I-131-thrombin inhibition using a chromogenic assay for thrombin showed that a maximum of 2.64 NIHU thrombin was inhibited in contrast to the controls which inhibited 0.76 and 0.70 NIHU. Controls with nonspecifically bound I-125-rHir also had 0.31 and 0.76 NIHU I-131-thrombin adherent to their respective surfaces whereas the maximum I-131-thrombin binding to the cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-rHir segments was 1.51 NIHU. Exposure to I-131-thrombin did not result in any release of covalently bound I-125-rHir from the cPU-BSA-SMCC-S-I-125-rHir segments. Thus, these results demonstrate that rHir can be covalently bound to this novel polyurethane surface and still maintain potent antithrombin activity.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; CardioTech Int Inc, Woburn, MA 01801 USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Boston, MA USA","Phaneuf, MD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, W Campus,4 Blackfan Circle,Harvard Inst Med Bldg, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,"Berceli, Scott/0000-0003-2257-0111",NHLBI NIH HHS [1 R43 HL53856-01A1],,,24,31,31,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0160-564X,1525-1594,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

The collagen fibers were succinylated. Hydrogel produced with the succinylated collagen was used for the sealant to reduce the amount of solid substance. To avoid contamination and the side effects of chemical reagents, the collagen thermally crosslinked under sterile conditions. A suspension of the collagen fibers was enmeshed in the interstices of Dacron fibers of fabric prostheses, which were then thermally crosslinked at 130 degrees C for 20 h. The prostheses were porous when the collagen fiber network was dry. Under wet conditions, however, the water permeability of the grafts was reduced to 0.1 ml/min from the 1,250 ml/min of the original prostheses. Three weeks after implantation in the abdominal aortas of dogs, 81.2 +/- 11% of the luminal surface was macroscopically thrombus free, and 56 +/- 14% was endothelialized. More than 95% of the coated collagen had been absorbed. Numerous fibroblasts had migrated into the graft walls, and capillary blood vessels had infiltrated the inside of the graft walls without foreign body reaction. In the controls, thrombus free areas averaged 9.0 +/- 5%, and endothelialized areas averaged 5.2 +/- 4%. Many giant cells, plasma cells, and lymphocytes had migrated into the graft wails, but no fibroblasts.

Design A prospective trial of 11 dogs with single congenital extrahepatic shunts. Procedure Rectal ammonia tolerance testing and routine biochemical tests were performed preoperatively on all dogs. In seven dogs, preoperative abdominal Doppler ultrasonography was also performed. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a single extrahepatic portocaval shunt in each animal, which was attenuated using a cellophane band with an internal diameter of 2 to 3 mm. The abdomen was closed routinely. Follow-up biochemical analysis and abdominal Doppler ultrasonography or splenoportography were performed postoperatively. Results The shunt was not amenable to total ligation in 11 dogs, based upon reported criteria. All dogs recovered uneventfully from surgery without evidence of portal hypertension, and showed clinical improvement thereafter. Shunt occlusion was deemed to have occurred in 10 dogs based on resolution of biochemical and/or sonographic abnormalities. One dog continued to have sonographic evidence of portosystemic shunting when evaluated 3 weeks after surgery, despite normal ammonia tolerance, but was lost to subsequent follow-up. Two dogs, in which 3 mm cellophane bands were placed, experienced delayed shunt occlusion. Conclusion Cellophane banding is simple to perform, and causes progressive attenuation of single extrahepatic shunts in dogs. Further work is needed to determine the maximum diameter of a cellophane band which will produce total attenuation, and the long-term safety and reliability of the treatment.","Univ Sydney, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Vet Cardiovasc Unit, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Hunt, GB (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Vet Cardiovasc Unit, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,,,,,27,50,51,1,10,AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY ASSN,MELBOURNE,"272 BRUNSWICK RD BRUNSWICK, MELBOURNE, VIC 3056, AUSTRALIA",0005-0423,,,AUST VET J,Aust.

The range of possible composite biomaterials is reviewed, together with the possible methods of fabrication and the limitations that these place on the design of composite components. The use of composite materials allows many new design possibilities, but this freedom of design requires a clearer understanding of the objectives and constraints on the design process. The testing of composite components also presents many challenging problems, which are not adequately addressed by existing standards developed for testing conventional monolithic materials. The interaction of composite materials with the body is more complex than that of the component materials, and the prediction of their long-term mechanical performance also presents many intractable difficulties. However, despite these challenges composite materials are likely to prove invaluable in the future development of orthopaedics. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The inability of the nerves to regenerate spontaneously and the limitations of autograft procedures led to the development of treatments involving insertion of the nerve ends into prosthetic tubular devices. Previous work showed that 'entubulation' of the nerve ends in a silicone tube containing a specific porous, resorbable collagen-GAG (CG) copolymer, serving as an analog of extracellular matrix, improved regeneration compared to an empty silicone tube. However, long-term treatment with silicone tubes produced constriction that caused partial degradation of the regenerated axons; for this and other reasons, implementation of a nondegradable tube may require a second surgical procedure for removal. In this study the silicone tube was replaced with porous and non-porous collagen tubes in order to produce fully degradable devices. CG-filled collagen tubes and controls (CG-filled silicone tubes and empty collagen and silicone tubes) were implanted in a 10-mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve, with three rats in each group. The regeneration was evaluated after six weeks using light microscope images of cross sections of the nerve that were digitized and analyzed. Histograms of the diameters of the axons were generated and compared. The cellular response to the implanted biomaterials was assessed histologically, and immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody to alpha-smooth muscle actin in order to determine the presence of myofibroblasts (contractile cells). Axonal regrowth was comparable in porous collagen, non-porous collagen, and silicone tubes filled with a CG matrix. These results support the implementation of a degradable collagen tube in place of a silicone device. Confirming earlier work, regeneration through the silicone and collagen tubes was enhanced by the CG copolymer, compared to empty tubes. A notable finding was a continuous layer of myofibroblasts on the surfaces of all of the six silicone tube prostheses, but on the inner surface of only one of six collagen tubes (Fisher's exact tests; P < 0.01), This is the first report of contractile capsules around silicone tubes, and supports the use of degradable collagen tubes in peripheral nerve regeneration, Macrophages were found bordering both the silicone and collagen tubes, and in the case of the collagen tubes, appeared to be participating in the regulation of the tubes.

On that basis, selective adhesion of different types of mammalian cells (PC12 pheochromocytoma, MSC80 schwannoma, Hep G2 hepatoblastoma, rat hepatocytes) on patterned surfaces was achieved. Therefore tracks (width in the range of a few tens of Irm) of reduced hydrophobicity were produced on polystyrene by photolithography and oxygen plasma treatment.

The procedure was based on a rapid (2.5 min) microwave-assisted solubilization of biomaterial with tetramethylammonium hydroxide, simultaneous quantitative ethylation-extraction of the mercury species into hexane (15 min) and flash isothermal separation (15-30 s) using a multicapillary regular column (100 cm) or a minicolumn (22 cm). The chromatographic hardware necessary for sample introduction into a microwave induced plasma was downscaled to a split injection port and a 20 x 20 x 10 cm compartment (housing the 1 m column) or a 22 cm x 1 cm od thermally insulated tube (housing the minicolumn) maintained at a constant temperature and connected directly to the detector. No dilution of the GC eluent (60-120 ml min(-1)) with make-up gas was necessary to achieve optimum sensitivity, Detection limits (as Hg) were 0.5 pg mu l(-1) (20 ng g(-1) dry mass) and 2 pg mu l(-1) (80 ng g-l dry mass)for MeHg+ and Hg2+, respectively.

However, loss of function may occur owing to tissue reactions, which are mainly caused by a variety of inflammatory reactions. Recently, we demonstrated that macrophages (MO) and T cells play key roles in these reactions. Since immunological studies showed that the T cell-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates MO, the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of modulating tissue reactions to biodegradable biomaterials by inactivating IFN-gamma. Dermal sheep collagen (DSC) was used as a test biomaterial. DSC impregnated with anti-IFN-gamma or phosphate-buffered saline (control) was implanted in rats. The results showed that cellular ingrowth and formation and function of giant cells were strongly delayed by anti-IFN-gamma. Also, MHC class II expression was strongly inhibited. In the treated DSC, some huge giant cells were formed at the interface but association with the DSC bundles did not occur. Finally, in both the control and treated DSC, T cells and NK cells were rarely detected. This study demonstrates that IFN-gamma plays an important role in the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials. This reaction can be modulated by anti-IFN-gamma, which warrants further studies of anti-IFN-gamma for clinical application to prevent unwanted tissue reactions to biomaterials.

The secondary and tertiary structures of KA give it very important and unique viscoelastic properties. HA-composed materials are currently used intraocularly during ophthalmological surgery to facilitate surgical procedures and prevent tissue damage. To examine the effects of three viscous biomaterials composed of hyaluronan (Healon(TM), IAL(TM), and Biolon(TM)) used in ophthalmological surgery, the membrane electrical properties of the erythroleukemic K562 cell line exposed to these materials were investigated. Membrane conductivity, membrane permittivity, and the conductivity of the cytosol were evaluated using dielectric relaxation measurements in the radiofrequency range and fitting the experimental results to the general equations of the Maxwell-Wagner effect. The results demonstrate that while membrane permittivity and the conductivity of the cytosol are not significantly altered, the membrane conductivity of K562 cells exposed to all three biomaterials increases substantially and in a time-dependent manner with respect to untreated cells. These observations seem to indicate that hyaluronan perturbs ionic transport while it does not vary the type, quantity, or distribution of membrane components. In addition, the variations induced by these substances on the cell membrane are not dependent upon the molecular weight or on the biological origin of hyaluronan. These results may aid in elucidating the mechanisms involved in hyaluronan/cell membrane interaction and thus may provide a deeper understanding of the complications related to their use in ophthalmological surgery.

However, a direct correlation between complement activation and inflammatory responses to biomaterial surfaces has yet to be established. Using an animal implantation model and gold surfaces bearing various thiol-linked functionalities, we investigated the potency of different surface groups in prompting complement activation in vitro and surface-mediated accumulation of inflammatory cells in vivo. Among the surfaces tested, mercaptoglycerol- and mercaptoethanol-bearing surfaces engendered the strongest inflammatory responses, as reflected by the accumulation of large numbers of adherent neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. In contrast, L-cysteine-coated surfaces caused only minor inflammatory responses, and both glutathione-modified and untreated gold implants attracted minimal numbers of inflammatory cells. The accumulation of inflammatory cells on mercaptoglycerol surfaces appears to arise from surface-mediated complement activation because complement-depleted animals failed to exhibit inflammatory responses to mercaptoglycerol-modified implants. Furthermore, there is a close relationship between surface-mediated complement activation (as measured by in vitro iC3b/C5b-9 generation and C3 deposition) and in vivo inflammatory responses. At least in this animal model and with these model surfaces, our results indicate that surface-mediated complement activation can be responsible for the subsequent accumulation of inflammatory cells on implant surfaces.

The object of this research was to explore the potentiality of the brazed titanium for biomaterials. The characteristics of the 1300 degrees C heat-treated and the 970 degrees C brazed specimens, with passivation and sterilization treatment, were evaluated by measurement of corrosion potential, E-corr, corrosion current densities, I-corr, polarization resistance of the reacted surface films, R-p, in a potentiodynamic test. The experimental results show that the corrosion rates of the heat-treated and the brazed samples are similar at E-corr, and the value of E-corr for the brazed sample is noble to the heat-treated samples. The passive current density of the brazed specimen is either lower or higher than the heat-treated specimen, depending on the polarization potential. By Auger electron spectroscopic and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis on specimens from the potentiostatic test, the elements of copper and nickel in the brazing filler were not detected while less alu mina was found in the reacted film of the brazed specimens when compared with the heat-treated specimens.

The unsaturated surfactant sodium 10-undecenoate [C11(:)] and the saturated surfactant sodium dodecanoate(C12) were immobilized on poly(ethylene) (PE), poly(propylene) (PP), and poly(cis-butadiene) (PB) surfaces. This was accomplished by treating polymeric substrates that were coated with C11(:) or C12 with an argon plasma. Derivatization X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Static Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SSIMS) showed that during the plasma treatment surfactants were covalently coupled to the polymeric surfaces. The chemical structure of both the surfactant and the polymeric substrate influenced the immobilization efficiency. At an optimal treatment time of 5 s, about 28 and 6% of the initial amount of carboxylate groups in the precoated C11(:) and C12 layer, respectively, was retained at the PE surface. The immobilization efficiencies of C11(:) and C12 on PP were about 20 and 9%, respectively. The immobilization efficiency of C11(:) and C12 on PB were both about 7%. The results obtained in this study indicate that the immobilization proceeds via a radical mechanism.

These polymers degrade by bulk hydrolysis of ester bonds and break down into their constituent monomers, lactic and glycolic acids which sire excreted from the body. The purpose of this investigation was to develop and characterize a biodegradable, implantable delivery system containing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (HCl) for the localized treatment of osteomyelitis and to study the extent of drug penetration from the site of implantation into the bone. Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory bone disease caused by pyogenic bacteria and involves the medullary cavity, cortex and periosteum. The advantages of localized biodegradable therapy include high, local antibiotic concentration at the site of infection, as well as, obviation of the need for removal of the implant after treatment. PLGA 50:50 implants were compressed from microcapsules prepared by nonsolvent-induced phase-separation using two solvent-nonsolvent systems, viz., methylene chloride-hexane (non-polar) and acetone-phosphate buffer (polar). In vitro dissolution studies were performed to study the effect of manufacturing procedure, drug loading and pH on the release of ciprofloxacin HCl. The extent of penetration of the drug from the site of implantation was studied using a rabbit model. The results of in vitro studies illustrated that drug release from implants made by;he nonpolar method was more rapid as compared to implants made by the polar method. The release of ciprofloxacin HCl from the implants was biphasic at less than or equal to 20% w/w drug loading, and monophasic at drug loading levels greater than or equal to 35% w/w. In vivo studies indicated that PLGA 50:50 implants were almost completely resorbed within five to six weeks. Sustained drug levels,:greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, up to 70 mm from the site of implantation, were detected for a period of six weeks.

The mechanisms involved in such acute inflammatory responses can be arbitrarily divided into phagocyte transmigration, chemotaxis, and adhesion to implant surfaces. We earlier observed that two chemokines-macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-and the phagocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)/surface fibrinogen interaction are, respectively, required for phagocyte chemotaxis and adherence to biomaterial surfaces, However, it is still not clear how the initial transmigration of phagocytes through the endothelial barrier into the area of the implant is triggered, Because implanted biomaterials elicit histaminic responses in the surrounding tissue, and histamine release is known to promote rapid diapedesis of inflammatory cells, we evaluated the possible role of histamine and mast cells in the recruitment of phagocytes to biomaterial implants. Using i.p. and s.c. implantation of polyethylene terephthalate disks in mice,ve find: (i) Extensive degranulation of mast cells, accompanied by histamine release, occurs adjacent to short-term i.p. implants. (ii) Simultaneous administration of H1 and H2 histamine receptor antagonists (pyrilamine and famotidine, respectively) greatly diminishes recruitment and adhesion of both neutrophils (<20% of control) and monocytes/macrophages (<30% of control) to implants. (iii) Congenitally mast cell-deficient mice also exhibit markedly reduced accumulation of phagocytes on both i.p. and s.c. implants, (iv) Finally, mast cell reconstitution of mast cell-deficient mice restores ""normal"" inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants. We conclude that mast cells and their granular products, especially histamine, are important in recruitment of inflammatory cells to biomaterial implants. Improved knowledge of such responses map permit purposeful modulation of both acute and chronic inflammation affecting implanted biomaterials.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Albany Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA","Tang, LP (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ltang@neo.bcm.tmc.edu,,,,,,73,144,149,0,9,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The response of two polyurethanes of differing primary structure to parameters of blood compatibility has now been investigated, using an in vitro test cell. Platelet (beta-thromboglobulin) release, complement (C3a) activation, the activation of free plasma and surface-bound factor XII were studied using fresh, human blood (no anticoagulant) or citrated plasma in control and surface-modified polyurethane. Surface modifications were designed to affect material thrombogenicity and included covalent attachment of heparin, taurine, a platelet membrane glycoprotein fragment, polyethylene oxide (PEO), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and glucose or glucosamine. Unmodified control polyurethanes caused platelet release and complement activation. High molecular weight (2000 D) polyethylene oxide reduced platelet release slightly but only glucose attachment to the surface produced a significant reduction in platelet activation All modifications reduced C3 activation compared with controls, but the greatest reduction was achieved with polyethylene oxide attachment or glycosylation. Most surface modifications were more activating of factor XII, both in plasma and on the material surfaces, than the control polyurethanes. Heparin and high molecular weight PEO produced the greatest activation of factor XII in the free plasma form, but low molecular weight PEO and glucosamine produced the greatest activation of surface-bound factor XIIa. The least activating surfaces, affecting both free plasma and surface-bound factor XIIa, were those treated with platelet membrane glycoprotein fragment and glucose. PEO surfaces performed relatively well, compared with controls and most surface modifications. The best overall surface, however, was the glucose-modified surface which was least activating considering all parameters of blood compatibility. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

With radiation susceptible PSf, only proper selection of the UV energy (lambda > 350 nm; for selective excitation of the photoinitiator) yielded membranes with preserved UF barrier layer. Possibilities for adjusting structure and morphology of the graft polymer (g-PAA) layer by variation of functionalization parameters such as AA concentration and UV irradiation time were investigated. Very long grafted chains (M-W > 10(5) g mol(-1)) at varied grafting density (GD = 0.01 ... 1.2 nmol cm(-2), relative to the outer surface area) were obtained. Partial penetration of the UF barrier layer by g-PAA was verified. Covalent immobilization of bovine serum albumin (BSA), gamma-globulin (gamma-Gl) and alkaline phosphatase (APh) was achieved by coupling with a water soluble carbodiimide. Bound BSA and gamma-Gl amounts were up to Gamma = 10 mu g cm(-2), for membranes accessible only from the outer surface thus not using the entire pore volume. Locally addressed covalent protein immobilization after photo-patterning the PSf surface could be visualized with a fluorescent FITC-BSA conjugate. A strong salt effect onto immobilized APh activity (increase with NaCl concentration) was observed, indicating internal transport/accessibility limitations in the g-PAA layer, Correlations between PAA structure (M-w, GD) and accessibility (from BSA or gamma-Gl binding and APh activity) could be established. The 'tentacle' g-PAA functionalized PSf UF membranes having preserved UF barrier and, e.g., with surface-bound receptors will find application in cell cultures under diffusion or perfusion conditions.

We have further investigated these PolyHEMA hydrogels and their potential to bridge CNS injury sites, Collagen IV-impregnated hydrogels containing Schwann cells were implanted into the lesioned optic tract in 14 rats, On examination 2-4 months later, there was good adherence between the implants and CNS tissue, and large numbers of viable Schwann cells (S100(+), GFAP(+), Laminin(+), and LNGFR(+)) were seen within the hydrogel matrices. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the collagen IV-impregnated PolyHEMA hydrogels preferentially supported the transplanted Schwann cells and not host glial cells such as astrocytes (GFAP(+)) or oligodendroglia (CAII(+)), Macrophages (ED1(+)) were also seen within the sponge structure. Eighty-three percent of the implanted hydrogels contained RT97(+) axons within their trabecular networks, Regrowing axons were associated with the transplanted Schwann cells and not with the small number of infiltrating astrocytes, RT97(+) axons were traced up to 510 pm from the nearest host neuropil, These axons were sometimes myelinated by the transplanted Schwann cells and expressed the peripheral myelin marker Po+. WGA/HRP-labeled retinal axons were seen within transplanted hydrogel sponges, with 40% of the cases growing for distances up to 350-450 mu m within the polymer network. The data indicate that impregnating PolyHEMA sponges with collagen IV can modify the host glial reaction and support the survival of transplanted Schwann cells. This study thus provides new information on how biomaterials could be used to modify and bridge CNS injury sites.

Therefore, surgical repair using different prosthetic biomaterials is becoming increasingly popular. Further to favourable results by French hernia surgeons, we studied the results of underlay prosthetic mesh repair using polypropylene mesh in complicated and recurrent incisional hernias. Method: After preparation and excision of the entire hernia sac, the posterior rectus sheath is freed from the muscle bellies on both sides. The peritoneum and posterior rectus sheaths are closed with a continuous looped polyglyconate suture. The prosthesis used for midline hernias is positioned on the posterior rectus sheath and extends far beyond the borders of the myoaponeurotic defect. The anterior rectus sheath is closed with a continuous suture. The prosthesis for lumbar and subcostal hernias is placed in a prepared space between the transverse and oblique muscles. Intraperitoneal placement of the mesh must be avoided. Results: Between January 1996 and August 1997 we performed a total of 33 incisional hernia repairs (14 primary hernias, 19 recurrent hernias) using this technique (16 women, 17 men, mean age 56.19 +/- 12.92 years). Local complications occurred in four patients (12%): superficial wound infection (n = 2), postoperative bleeding, requiring reoperation (n = 1), minor hemato-seroma (n = 1). One patient suddenly died on the 3rd post-operative day from severe pulmonary embolism (mortality 3%). Twenty-two patients with a minimum follow up to 6 months were re-examined clinically. The average follow-up time for this group was 9 months (range 6-17 months). To date no recurrent hernias have been observed. There were only minor complaints like ""a feeling of tension"" in the abdominal wall (n = 3) and slight pain under physical stress (n = 6). Conclusions: The use of prosthetic mesh should be considered for repair of large or recurrent incisional hernias, especially in high-risk patients (obesity, obstructive lung disease) and complicated hernias. The aforementioned technique of underlay prosthetic repair using polypropylene mesh fixed onto the posterior rectus sheath allows for anatomical and consolidated reconstruction of the damaged abdominal wall with excellent results and low complication rates.","Univ Munich, Klinikum Innenstadt, Chirurg Klin & Poliklin, D-80336 Munich, Germany","Trupka, AW (reprint author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Innenstadt, Chirurg Klin & Poliklin, Nussbaumstr 20, D-80336 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,31,17,17,0,1,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0009-4722,,,CHIRURG,Chirurg,JUL,1998.0,69,7,,,,,766,772,,10.1007/s001040050488,,,,7,Surgery,Surgery,103QW,WOS:000074970200011,9738226.0,,,,2019-02-25

Potential damage has not the same explanation under different conditions of cold exposure. Even a moderate decrease of temperature leads to irreversible damage when applied to untreated organismes. Deep freezing injuries are due to crystallization of ice, and cellular consequences are quite different according to the temperature kinetics. The fraction survival, as a function of hypothermic kinetics, has a bimodal distribution, reflecting two distinct mechanisms : a first process, concomitant of a slow cooling rate, with extracellular ice formation, and a second one, during fast cooling rates, with intracellular ice formation. Thereby, cryopreservation protocols have to focus on many variable factors, including choices of a cryoprotectant, which delays ice formation, and a cooling rate leading to an optimal cell survival, Under these conditions, osmotic effects are almost neutralized. Nevertheless, these methods can be applied only to isolated cells. For tissues or organs, ice formation should be avoided at low temperatures. Vitrification is the corresponding process by which tissue water is undercooled to the glass transition temperature and solidified into the amorphous or glassy state. Very high cooling and warming rates are needed, The use of an appropriate cryoprotective agent mixture, called a <<vitrification solution>> should be useful : however, high-concentration vitrification solutions have still undesired toxic effects. Finally, an optimal cryoprotectant, in terms of cooling/warming rates and toxicity has to be found.","Hop Lapeyronie, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France","Vannereau, H (reprint author), Hop Lapeyronie, 371 Av Doyen Gaston Giraud, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,0,1,2,0,2,FERTIL-STERIL-CONTRACEPTION,PARIS,"55 RUE DES PETITS CHAMPS, 75001 PARIS, FRANCE",1157-8181,,,CONTRACEPT FERTIL S,Contracept.

Immobilization techniques for collagen and hydroxyapatite Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2), the main components contacting an implant within the human body, were tested. The oxide layers were created by electrochemical polarization in phosphate buffer solutions. The thickness of the layers depended on the formation potential. We found a thickness/potential relation of approximately 2.2 nm/V. At formation potentials up to 80 V anatase was the only titanium dioxide modification traceable by Raman spectroscopy and XRD. The electrochemically assisted deposition of hydroxyapatite on these surfaces starts with an amorphous product which can be monitored by SEM, IR and Raman spectroscopy. The immobilization of collagen followed by anodic electrochemical polarization results either in partial integration of collagen fibrils into the oxide layer or at least in a strong increase-of the interaction force between TiO2 and the collagen fibrils.","Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Werkstoffwissensch, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","Born, R (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Werkstoffwissensch, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",,"Born, Rene/D-8798-2011; Scharnweber, Dieter/B-3382-2010","Born, Rene/0000-0001-6793-2273; ",,,,37,33,33,0,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0937-0633,,,FRESEN J ANAL CHEM,Fresenius J.

Methyl-mercury com;hounds were kept intact without decomposition or losses by ei;evaporation. Quantitative recoveries of total mercury were achieved with a two-step microwave attack using a combination of HNO3 and H2O2 solutions as extractant. The whole pretreatment procedure only takes 15 min, which can be further shortened by an automated robust operation with an open focused system. These analytical procedures were validated by the analysis of environmental certified reference materials. The results confirm that the open focused microwave technique is a promising tool for solid sample preparation in analytical and environmental chemistry.","Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Lab Chim Bioinorgan & Envirom, EP CNRS 132, F-64000 Pau, France; Univ Basque Country, Dept Analyt Chem, Bilbao 48080, Spain","Donard, OFX (reprint author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Lab Chim Bioinorgan & Envirom, EP CNRS 132, Helioparc, F-64000 Pau, France.",,"de Diego, Alberto/L-7381-2014","TSENG, CHUN-MAO/0000-0003-1922-3936; DE DIEGO RODRIGUEZ, ALBERTO/0000-0002-3480-2795; Amouroux, David/0000-0002-0056-8590",,,,33,12,12,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,LONDON,"ONE GUNPOWDER SQUARE, LONDON EC4A 3DE, ENGLAND",0142-0453,,,J AUTOM CHEM,J.

Human plasma fibronectin (HPF) is an important matrix glycoprotein that mediates cell and protein attachment to each other or to the extracellular matrix present during wound healing. The objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption of HPF onto polished commercially pure titanium (cpTi) by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and to measure the resultant surface contact angle before and after HPF binding. Two types of cpTi disks, one highly polished in our laboratory (HSS) and one commercially prepared (31), were reacted with HPF solutions of varying concentrations (1 mu g/mL-10 ng/mL). ESCA survey spectra of samples coated with 1 mu g/mL of fibronectin showed an increase in organic nitrogen and carbon compared with uncoated controls. Contact angle measurements of HSS and 31 cpTi disks showed no significant difference in average contact angle (36.3 degrees +/- 3.5 and 39.1 degrees +/- 3.1) despite differences in local root mean square (RMS) surface roughness (4.45 +/- 0.46 nm and 22.37 +/- 4.17 nm) as measured by AFM. Images obtained by AFM showed that 31 specimens were more irregular, with large parallel polishing grooves. Adsorbed HPF appeared in a globular form with an average length of 16.5 +/- 1.0 nm, a height of 2.5 +/- 0.5 nm, and a width of 9.6 +/- 1.2 nm. Fibronectin coating on both HSS and 31 cpTi specimens resulted in a significant increase in hydrophobicity compared to uncoated specimens. These results indicate the significance of HPF on cpTi and may explain how cyTi implants function in situ.

Both standard leads and surface-modified leads were used. The surface modification technique was applied to achieve controlled release of the antibiotic gentamicin. The insulating polyurethane tubing material of the leads was provided with an acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymer surface graft and then loaded with gentamicin. Implantation periods varied from day 4, to week 3 1/2, to week 10. We investigated tissue reactions in the absence of an infectious challenge and also the efficacy of surface-modified leads in preventing infection after challenge with Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. It was demonstrated that the applied surface modification did not induce adverse effects although during early postimplantation an increase in infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages and wound fluid and fibrin deposition were observed. After bacterial challenge, standard leads were heavily infected at each explantation period, denoted by abscesses, cellular debris, and bacterial colonies. Ln contrast, little or no infection was observed, either macroscopically or by bacterial cultures, with the surface-modified leads. Microscopy showed little evidence of the bacterial challenge, and that primarily at day 4. It was concluded that the applied surface modification demonstrated enhanced infection resistance and thus represents a sound approach to the battle against infectious complications with biomaterials.

However, their equiatomic composition (50 wt% Ni) is controversial, and concerns have been raised about their biocompatibility level because of the carcinogenicity potential. The relative in vitro genotoxicity of NiTi therefore was evaluated and compared to commercially pure titanium (cpTi), 316L stainless steel (SS 316L), and positive and negative controls. To do so, human peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in semiphysiological medium that previously had been exposed to the biomaterials. The electron microscopy in situ end-labeling (EM-ISEL) assay then was performed in order to provide quantification of in vitro chromatin DNA single-stranded breaks (SSBs). Chromosomes and nuclei were harvested and exposed to exonuclease III, which amplifies DNA lesions at 3' ends of breaks. After random priming, incorporation of biotin-dUTP was labeled by immunogold binding, which then was detected using electron microscopy. Cellular chromatin exposed to the positive control demonstrated a significantly stronger immunogold labeling than when it was exposed to NiTi, cpTi, SS 316L extracts, or the untreated control. Moreover, gold particle counts, whether in the presence of NiTi, cpTi, or the negative control medium, were not statistically different. NiTi genocompatibility therefore presents promising prescreening results towards its biocompatibility approval.

This paper reports on the application of FT-IX microspectroscopy (FT-IRM) for the investigation of inorganic and organic phases of the rough composite and separated phases obtained by mechanical or chemical extraction methods. A comparison of FT-IRM with the conventional KBr pellet method was made and indicates that the macro and micro FT-IR methods are complementary: the former revealed new chemical groups not visualized with the KBr method whereas the latter detected the major compound of the blend. FT-IR microspectroscopy was revealed to be a powerful method of analysis that is complementary to other existing spectroscopic methods.

The flow cell is used to conduct an investigation into the in vitro generation of C3a by a regenerated cellulose membrane, Cuprophan. The effects of experimental variables such as temperature, blood flow rate, contact area and wall shear rate on C3a generation by Cuprophan were studied. The results show that C3a generation by Cuprophan is lower at 12 degrees C than at 22 degrees C, which is in turn lower than C3a generation at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, a decrease in contact area, and increase in wall shear rate and blood flow rate, can produce a decrease in C3a concentration.","Univ Strathclyde, Bioengn Unit, Glasgow G4 ONW, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Glasgow, Glasgow Royal Infirm, Dept Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Lamba, NMK (reprint author), Univ Strathclyde, Bioengn Unit, Glasgow G4 ONW, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,22,4,4,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Neither titanium nor PTFE displayed a significant change in capsule thickness over time. The total cell numbers decreased over time for both types of material. At 12 wk the PTFE implants, compared to titanium, were surrounded by a significantly thicker reactive capsule with larger total cell numbers. No significant differences were seen in the macrophage subset response between the two types of implants.

Modern organosilicon chemistry, based in part on the artificial silicon-carbon bond, coincided with the emergence of the biomaterials and bioengineering fields fifty years ago, and was thought to be a fortunate coincidence according to conventional wisdom that high-molecular-weight polymeric siloxanes were chemically and biologically inert. These concepts have been challenged by reports of silicone migration and degradation following insertion of gel-filled breast implants, claims of a novel systemic illness appearing in many breast implant recipients, and investigations implicating varied and permeating immunotoxic mechanisms of disease causation by breast devices. The present study develops additional potential pathogenetic ideas based on alterations of cell biochemistry by silicon-containing compounds, and offers correlation of the patients' diverse clinical features with plausable disruption of basic biological processes. This in turn raises new questions concerning everyday environmental exposure, has broad implications for multiple other diseases, can provide alternative directions for future investigative research, and may contribute to the ongoing redefinition of immune dysfunction and inflammation.","Monmouth Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, Long Branch, NJ USA","Brawer, AE (reprint author), 170 Morris Ave, Long Branch, NJ 07740 USA.",,,,,,,46,4,4,1,3,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0306-9877,1532-2777,,MED HYPOTHESES,Med.

In recent years, significant advances have been made both in the theoretical and experimental areas of contact mechanics, especially in the area of soft solids, in relating the contact deformation to interfacial adhesion. On the theoretical front, new theories of contact mechanics have been developed to relate the interfacial force induced deformation to the thermodynamic work of adhesion both for elastic and viscoelastic solids. On the experimental front, several new techniques have been developed to measure the interfacial forces and the interfacial-force-induced deformations. These techniques have been used, with the aid of the theories of contact mechanics, to measure directly the surface and interfacial energies of a. variety of polymers and other model surfaces. These experimental and theoretical developments have also been exploited to measure quantitatively the effect of interfacial chain diffusion on the adhesion of polymer inter-faces. We summarize the recent developments in the theories of contact mechanics, and their applications in the design and interpretation of experimental measurement of molecular level adhesion between elastomers, glassy and viscoelastic polymers. We also review the experimental and theoretical developments related to the role of chain diffusion on interfacial adhesion. Finally, we identify some potential new applications of contact-mechanics-based techniques in such emerging area of adhesion science as molecular level studies of adhesion of viscoelastic materials and biomaterials.","3M Adhes Div, Aerosp Lab, 3M Ctr, St Paul, MN 55144 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Mat Sci & Chem Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Mangipudi, VS (reprint author), 3M Adhes Div, Aerosp Lab, 3M Ctr, 209-1C-22, St Paul, MN 55144 USA.",vsmangipudi@mmm.com,,,,,,91,19,19,1,23,AMER CHEMICAL SOC INC,AKRON,"RUBBER DIV UNIV AKRON PO BOX 499, AKRON, OH 44309-0499 USA",0035-9475,,,RUBBER CHEM TECHNOL,Rubber Chem.

The spreading of the cells, formation of F-actin and exposure of CD62P, a marker for alpha-granule release, were detected by specific antibodies and FITC-labelled phalloidine. The plasma proteins used were albumin, complement factors C1q and C3, fibrinogen, thrombin and von Willebrand factor. Normal plasma was used as a positive control. Of the pure plasma proteins adsorbed, von Willebrand factor was the only protein which induced a marked exposure (> 70%) of CD62P. Platelets adhering to fibrinogen and thrombin only showed a marked exposure (>70%) of CD62P when von Willebrand factor was added to the platelet suspension. This addition of von Willebrand factor inhibited the adhesion of platelets to surface-adsorbed C1q, C3 and albumin. The finding that pure von Willebrand factor was the only protein which induced a high exposure of CD62P was verified by the adhesion of platelets to surface-adsorbed factor-VIII deficient plasma. F-actin was seen around cell edges at all surfaces, although there was a difference in spreading. We conclude that CD62P exposure on the cell surface of adhering platelets is induced mainly by von Willebrand factor but could be influenced by other proteins, and that the spreading of platelets is not correlated to the exposure of CD62P.

This study was undertaken to determine the extent to which silicone elastomer, with or without either pre-adsorbed human serum albumin (HSA), IgG, fibrinogen or whole plasma, can activate peripheral blood monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats from the local Red Cross Blood Center. Monocytes were cultured for 18 h, culture supernatant collected, and analyzed for IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by employing commercial ELISA kits. Monocytes, in contact with either polystyrene or silicones without protein adsorption, were minimally activated as evidenced by the low concentration of all the cytokines measured. On the other hand, monocytes became activated when in contact with silicones having adsorbed either of the above proteins. The silicone gel, silicone oil and silicone gel/oil combination appeared to cause the monocytes to secrete nearly twice the amount of all three cytokines as compared with silicone elastomer. This result may be a function of the increased effective surface area produced by the silicone gels and silicone oils. Contact angle measurements confirm that silicones have a very hydrophobic surface, whereas tissue culture grade polystyrene (TPST) is hydrophilic. We know that hydrophobic surfaces tend to be much more denaturing to adsorbed proteins than hydrophilic surfaces. Thus our results indicate that plasma proteins adsorbed to very hydrophobic surfaces cause monocytes to secrete significant amounts of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

A human growth hormone (hGH) adsorption method was used in this study to investigate the influence of the formulated apatite (AP)-specific area on loading and release. AP powders were formulated with a 200-500 mu m granulometry and various specific areas. Two milligrams of hGH in solution were deposited for 24 h at 37 degrees C on 100 mg of AP with different specific areas. The amount of hGH loaded was determined by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and eluted stain bioassay (ESTA) using Nb2 lymphoma rat cells. Although loading was not greatly influenced by a specific area between 3 and 25 m(2)/g, dependency was noted for higher specific areas. Human GH release was measured by IRMA and ESTA over a 33-day period, with half-time release between 25 and 79 h. Comparison of IRMA and ESTA measurements for the hGH amounts loaded showed that hGH biologic activity was conserved. Results indicate that it is feasible to control the quantity of TA loading on AP by modifying specific areas for in vivo applications.

The attachment of Staphylococcus aureus on polyurethane surfaces was observed directly using an automated video microscopy system. Surfaces were preconditioned with components of platelet-fibrin thrombi, including fibrinogen, thrombin, plasma, and isolated platelets. Experiments were performed in a radial flow chamber, and attachment rate constants were compared on the preconditioned surfaces in an effort to understand the complex relationship that exists between bacterial infection and thrombosis on synthetic biomaterials. Preadsorption of fibrinogen to surfaces significantly increased S. aureus adhesion compared to those preadsorbed with albumin alone while the presence of fibrin dramatically increased bacterial attachment compared to plasma preadsorbed surfaces. While the presence of adherent platelets also increased bacterial attachment, fibrin appeared to play a larger role in mediating bacterial adhesion on polyurethane surfaces. Striking results were obtained on the zwitterionic phosphonated polyurethane for a number ol: pretreatment conditions with regard to decreased bacterial adhesion and fibrinogen deposition.

The TFAA derivatization reaction exhibited rapid kinetics on the hydroxyl-terminated SAMs. The data from each of the surface analytical techniques consistently indicated a nearly complete surface reaction.

In this study, human osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2) were cultured on two types of xenogenic biomaterials obtained from bovine bone. Both biomaterials were similar in architectural organization and surface topography, but they differed in matrix components. The first one was characterized by preservation of the mineralized collagen matrix, and the second by complete deproteinization which only preserved the mineral phase. Cells cultured at the surface of both biomaterials were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The beta(1)-integrin subunit, known to bind cell and collagen, is the major integrin of the osteoblast. It was localized using immunogold in transmission electron microscopy. At the surface of the collagen-containing matrix, cells exhibited an elongated shape and oriented axis parallel to the underlying collagen bundles. The beta(1)-integrin subunit was localized at the outer surface of cells, in close association with collagen and at the contact points between cells and biomaterials. In contrast, at the surface of the single mineral matrix, cells were round shaped with random disposition. Gold particles were found around the cells with no specific relation to the biomaterial. These results strongly suggest that the chemical nature of the surface of a bone biomaterial directly influences adhesion process, shape, and spatial organization of cultured osteoblastic cells.

Irrespective of the washing process, proteins of molecular weight greater than 90 kDa remained associated with both surfaces while water washings alone removed most low molecular weight material. A 29 kDa protein, alpha-1-microglobulin, was removed from glass by water washing but required a 30% (v/v) isopropanol wash to desorb from polystyrene, implying attachment via hydrophobic bonding. The adhesion to polystyrene surfaces of Pseudomonas aeruginosa B4, a clinical isolate from a urinary tract infection (UTI), was strongly associated with the presence of alpha-1-microglobulin, which may be acting as a mediator of bacterial adhesion.

In the past, integrin-binding peptides have been immobilized on substrates to partially control osteoblast adhesion; the present study focused on the design, synthesis, and bioactivity of the nos el peptide sequence Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg that selectively enhances heparan sulfate-mediated osteoblast adhesion mechanisms. Osteoblast, but not endothelial cell or fibroblast, adhesion was enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) on substrates modified with Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg peptides, indicating that these peptides may be osteoblast- or bone cell specific. Blocking osteoblast cell-membrane receptors with various concentrations of soluble Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptides did not inhibit subsequent cell adhesion on substrates modified with Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg peptides, providing evidence that osteoblasts interact with Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and with Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg peptides via distinct (i.e., integrin- and proteoglycan-mediated) mechanisms, each uniquely necessary for osteoblast adhesion. The present study constitutes an example of rational design/selection of bioactive peptides, confirms that osteoblast adhesion to substrates can be controlled selectively and significantly by immobilized peptides, and elucidates criteria and strategies for the design of proactive dental/orthopedic implant biomaterials.

The primate also is used in orthopedic-related research for studying limb anatomy, gait, and age-related bone loss. In order to better understand the appropriateness of these animal models for human THR, external morphologies of thirty-three adult Caucasian human, sixteen adult chimpanzee, and forty-two adult greyhound femora were compared using osteometric methods. Measured parameters included anteversion angle, cervico-diaphyseal angle, femoral head offset in the frontal plane, and anterior bo cv profiles along the femoral diaphysis. Although some of the measured parameters were approximately similar between species (e.g., mean cervico-diaphyseal angle of humans and chimpanzees), the majority demonstrated morphologic differences that may be biomechanically significant for interpreting stress transfer across the hip (e.g., mean anteversion angle and mean normalized femoral head offset between species). Additionally, age-related changes in proximal femoral morphology and gait pattern, as well as species-related differences in local muscle and inertial forces, may result in notably different loading conditions across the hip joint of each species. Therefore, discretion must be exercised when evaluating canine or primate THR materials and designs for potential use in the human hip.

Conditions maximizing surface coverage for each molecule were employed with the aim of inhibiting protein adsorption and increasing the density of end groups. Neutron reflectivities of the grafted layers immersed in deuterium oxide (heavy water) were measured and used to calculate volume fraction profiles of the polymer as a function of distance from the surface. These density profiles were combined with protein adsorption data on the grafted layers to compare with recent theoretical and experimental studies of protein resistance by PEO at surfaces. We found that the grafting density is maximized by coupling the linear PEO from a K2SO4 salt buffer, which is a poor solvent for PEO. However, the grafting density of star PEO was maximized when no K2SO4 was used and the stars were dissolved near the overlap concentration. Concentration profiles obtained from the reflectivity data show that the hydrated polymers swell to similar to 10 times the dried layer thickness and exhibit a low density (maximum volume fractions < 0.4 PEO) throughout the layer. The PEO surfaces obtained with both the star and linear polymers resisted adsorption of cytochrome-c and albumin except for a small amount of cytochrome-c adsorption on the short, many-armed star polymer surface. A hypothesis of adsorption on the star polymer layer is presented and criteria for controlling receptor-mediated cell-substrate interactions by ligand-modified chain ends are discussed.

The oxygen complex differentiates between the enantiomeric isomers of amino acids and sugars. The direction of this differentiation agrees with that of biological systems in nature where only the L-isomers of amino acids are used to form proteins, while D-form sugars form polysaccharides. These results represent the first complete differentiation of enantiomeric isomers in an inorganic system, and were achieved without the aid of any in vivo biomaterials, such as enzymes. Other alkali chlorides were also examined. The eutectic compound of potassium chloride and water forms a similar oxygen complex which also differentiates the isomers of amino acids and sugars. However, the direction of this differentiation is opposite that in the case of sodium chloride. These results call for the special attention to the fact that the concentration of potassium ions in living cells is higher than that of sodium ions. The mechanism of these observations is not yet clear, but is likely to involve the structure of an aqueous solution of a specific concentration (0.1 M) of salt. The effects of various gases were also examined. Like oxygen, hydrogen sulfide also forms a complex with the eutectic compound of sodium chloride and water. This complex differentiates the isomers of amino acids and sugars in a similar manner to the way the oxygen complex dose. This finding suggests that the enantiomeric isomers of amino acids and sugars could be differentiated in an inorganic environment. Carbon dioxide also forms a complex with the eutectic compound of sodium chloride and water, but does not differentiate the isomers.","Kanagawa Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 2591293, Japan","Fujiwara, S (reprint author), Kanagawa Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, 2946 Tsuchiya, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 2591293, Japan.",,,,,,,21,7,7,1,3,JAPAN SOC ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,TOKYO,"26-2 NISHIGOTANDA 1 CHOME SHINAGAWA-KU, TOKYO, 141, JAPAN",0910-6340,,,ANAL SCI,Anal.

Whereas receptor interactions with freely diffusible soluble ligands are quantitatively governed by the mean ligand concentration, interactions with spatially constrained substratum-bound ligands may be affected not only by the mean ligand concentration, but also by the ligand spatial microdistribution. To probe this hypothesis we have generated surfaces presenting galactose ligands at different concentrations and different capabilities for micromobility - and thus spatial microdistribution - by means of polyethylene oxide tethering and assayed for hepatocyte spreading mediated by asialoglycoprotein receptor/cytoskeleton linkages. We demonstrate that spreading is not uniquely determined by the mean galactose concentration presented by the culture substrate. Rather, the ability of primary hepatocytes to spread is additionally specified by a combination of ligand concentration and tether length. Our results suggest spreading results when monovalent ligands possess sufficient mobility to form effectively multivalent bonds with the receptor; that is, when the substratum-bound ligands to cluster in spatial microdomains.

The implant consists of a silicone tube that is inserted into the anterior chamber at one end and is attached at the other end to a silicone plate that is sutured to the outside of the globe beneath the conjunctiva. The glaucoma ""implant"" becomes a ""drain"" over the first 3 to 6 postoperative weeks as the silicone plate is enclosed by a fibrous capsule that allows a space to form into which fluid can drain and from which fluid can be absorbed by the surrounding tissues. Ideally, the size and thickness of the capsule (the filtering bleb) that surrounds the plate is such that the amount of fluid that passes through the capsule is identical to the amount of fluid produced by the eye at an intraocular pressure of 8 to 14 mmHg. The most common long-term complication of these implants is failure of the filtering bleb 2 to 4 years after surgery due to the formation of a thick fibrous capsule around the device. Micromovement of the smooth drainage plate against the scleral surface may be integral to the mechanism of glaucoma implant failure by stimulating low-level activation of the wound healing response, increased collagen scar formation, and increased fibrous capsule thickness. To test this hypothesis, we modified seven Baerveldt implants by adding porous cellular ingrowth material to the posterior surface of the drainage plate. Seven modified and five unmodified implants were placed in adult rabbit eyes. After 6 months,we found that the fibrous capsule around the modified implants was significantly thinner than the capsule surrounding the unmodified implants (p < 0.05), particularly on the surface between the porous ingrowth material and the sclera (p < 0.05). Although type I collagen predominated in the fibrous capsules around both types of implants, the amount of type III collagen in the capsules around the modified implants was significantly less than the amount around the unmodified implants (p < 0.05). We believe that these data suggest a reduction in the wound healing response to the modified implants, with greater stability of capsule thickness. Long-term studies are needed to verify that the stability of the capsules around the modified implants persists over a period of years, in which case this type of modification may prove useful in prolonging the functional life of these devices in the surgical treatment of glaucoma.

However, chemicals used for specimen processing can alter and degrade the cement interface. With few exceptions, cement degradation caused by specimen processing has not been systematically and quantitatively assessed. This is especially the case for the new non-formalin based fixatives currently being marketed. We measured physical and mechanical changes that accumulated over time as bone cement was exposed to different chemicals routinely used for fixation, dehydration, and embedding hard tissue specimens. Cylindrical bone cement plugs were submersed into 14 different chemical solutions according to applicable histological protocols. After exposure to the chemicals, the weight, volume, and compressive strength of each specimen was measured. The type of chemicals used for fixation, dehydration, and infiltration, and the length of time in solution were significant factors in the physical and mechanical differences observed. Consideration of these factors will enable choice of appropriate fixatives, dehydrators, and embedding media to allow maintenance of the bone-cement-implant interface without processing artifacts or mechanical aberrations and will insure accurate interpretation of cement mantle characteristics observed.","Good Samaritan Hosp, Orthopaed Res Lab, W Palm Beach, FL 33402 USA; Palm Beach Orthopaed Inst, W Palm Beach, FL USA","Harman, MK (reprint author), Good Samaritan Hosp, Orthopaed Res Lab, POB 3166, W Palm Beach, FL 33402 USA.",,"Banks, Scott/B-6345-2008","Banks, Scott/0000-0003-0404-6826",,,,43,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0147-8885,2046-0236,,J HISTOTECHNOL,J.

Design: Randomized laboratory investigation using a synthetic subtrochanteric femur fracture model. Setting: Simulated stable and unstable fractures were created at three levels in the subtrochanteric region of synthetic femora. Instrumented specimens were tested elastically in a biomaterials testing system. Intervention: Synthetic femora were instrumented with either a statically locked first-generation femoral nail or a statically locked second-generation femoral nail. Main Outcome Measurements: Elastic stiffness for both the stable and unstable fracture groups was measured in both compression and torsion. Unstable fracture specimens were tested to failure in compression, and load to failure was measured. Results: Throughout the subtrochanteric region, second-generation femoral nail constructs were consistently stiffer in compression and torsion than were statically locked first-generation femoral nail constructs. In general, second-generation constructs also withstood larger loads to failure in the unstable fracture model. Conclusions: Second-generation nails provided significantly enhanced mechanical stiffness compared with first-generation femoral nails when used to treat both stable and unstable subtrochanteric femur fractures. Although these results were obtained by using a well-controlled, mechanically consistent model, clinical validation of an increased incidence of fracture unions or of decreased time to union is required before we can recommend that second-generation nails be used routinely to treat subtrochanteric femur fractures.","Univ Kentucky, Albert B Chandler Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed Surg, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Pugh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Albert B Chandler Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed Surg, K-411 Kentucky Clin, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",,,,,,,31,24,24,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0890-5339,1531-2291,,J ORTHOP TRAUMA,J.

Participants: Fifty-nine patients participated in this study, in which 60 specimens, including 37 hydrogel and 21 silicone capsule specimens as well as 2 whole eyes, were gathered. There were no control subjects. Intervention: The capsule specimens were obtained from eyes operated on previously for scleral buckling for retinal detachment. The two whole eyes were enucleated. All specimens were studied with routine optic microscopy. Main Outcome Measures: Patient characteristics, type of scleral buckling, and number of operations performed were analyzed. Histologically, the capsular structure, its interface with the explant, and its different components also were studied. Remnants of the buckling material also were investigated. Results: There were 45 male and 14 female patients, with a mean age of 49 years. Histologically, capsule specimens had a fibrous matrix with fibroblasts and few inflammatory cells. Eighteen (48.6%) of 37 hydrogel capsule specimens displayed hydrogel fragments surrounded by a foreign body giant cell granuloma in 16 cases. Conclusion: Nonabsorbable materials undergo encapsulation after implantation on the eye surface. Giant cell granuloma was observed in some hydrogel capsule specimens in relation to hydrogel fragmentation. The exact origin of this fragmentation remains unknown.","Hotel Dieu, Dept Ophthalmol, F-75181 Paris 04, France; Hop Bichat, Dept Ophthalmol, F-75877 Paris, France","D'Hermies, F (reprint author), Hotel Dieu, Dept Ophthalmol, 1 Pl Parvis Notre Dame, F-75181 Paris 04, France.",,,,,,,20,31,31,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0161-6420,,,OPHTHALMOLOGY,Ophthalmology,JUN,1998.0,105,6,,,,,1079,1086,,10.1016/S0161-6420(98)96011-0,,,,8,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,ZR726,WOS:000074007600041,9627660.0,,,,2019-02-25

Five patients experienced a knee joint infection after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with 4 artificial graftings, and 9 caught joint or wound infections, after limb traumatic injuries or bone neoplastic ruptures involving femur, tibia, calcaneum and humerus, treated by arthroplasty or osteosynthesis with implantation of biomaterials. Septic arthritis was experienced one week to one year after reconstructive surgery, and had evolved for several months to years before etiologic diagnosis in 5 cases. Specimens of pus, tissues or removed implants produced numerous slow growing small colonies of Gram positive cocci arranged in clumps on culture media incubated in anaerobic atmosphere only. In 10 patients, the same organism was disclosed in several separate specimens. The identification of P. magnus was assessed by the enzym profile (rapid ID 32A API strips), gaz liquid chromatography, catalase and coagulase production, resistance to novobiocin and Na polyanethol sulphonate, antibiotic sensitivity testing performed by disc method was constant to penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, imipenem and pristinamycin with penicillin G MICs < 0,125 mg/l and metronidazole MICs < 1mg/l. Erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampicin, tetracycline and fosfomycin were active against more than 70 % of P. magnus.. All patients were cured after a prolonged course of various antibiotics and surgical removal of the foreign material whenever possible. We studied in vitro binding of P. magnus with extracellular matrix proteins adsorbed onto biomaterials, by particle agglutination assays of latex beads coated with proteins. Eigty one % of strains bound to collagen, 69 % to fibrinogen and 46 % to fibonectin.

Seven cadaveric cervical spines were implanted with a porous tantalum spacer and a titanium alloy spacer, and their radiographic and imaging characteristics were evaluated. Objective. To determine the radiographic characteristics of porous tantalum and titanium implants used as spacers in the cervical spine. Summary of Background Data. Anterior decompressive surgery of the disc space or the vertebral body creates a defect that frequently is repaired with autologous bone grafts to promote spinal fusion. Donor site morbidity, insufficient donor material, and additional surgical time have spurred the development of biomaterials to replace or supplement existing spinal reconstruction techniques. Although the promotion of a solid bony fusion is critical, the implanted biomaterial should be compatible with modern imaging techniques, should allow visualization of the spinal canal and neural foramina, and should permit radiographic assessment of bony ingrowth. Methods. Cadaveric spines containing the implants were imaged with plain radiography, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The image distortion produced by the implants was determined qualitatively and quantitatively. Results. The tantalum and titanium spacers were opaque on plain radiographic films. On computed tomographic scans, more streak artifact was associated with the tantalum implants than with the titanium. On magnetic resonance imaging, the porous tantalum implant demonstrated less artifact than did the titanium spacer on T1- and T2-weighted spin echo and on T2*-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance images. Overall; the tantalum im pla nt produced less artifact on magnetic resonance imaging than did the titanium spacer and therefore allowed for better visualization of the surrounding bony and neural structures. Conclusion. The material properties of titanium and porous tantalum cervical interbody implants contribute to their differential appearance in different imaging methods. The titanium implant appears to image best with computed tomography, whereas the porous tantalum implant produces less artifact than does the titanium implant on several magnetic resonance imaging sequences.","Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurol Surg, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; Univ Miami, Dept Neurosurg, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; Wallace Mem Baptist Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Pusan, South Korea; Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neuroradiol, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA","Dickman, CA (reprint author), Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurol Surg, 350 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.",,,,,,,16,29,29,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,JUN 1,1998.0,23,11,,,,,1245,1250,,10.1097/00007632-199806010-00014,,,,6,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,ZU113,WOS:000074163600014,9636978.0,,,,2019-02-25

We used these sheets to replace part of the pericardium in dogs, and the state of pericardial repair and regeneration were evaluated. As a control sheet, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (EPTFE) with a thickness of 0.1 mm was used. After implantation of the PGA-amnion (DHT-H) sheet, soft connective tissue with abundant capillaries was observed, and its surface was covered with a mesothelial cell layer with many microvilli. The basement membrane was nearly normal. After implantation of the PGA-amnion (GA-S) sheet, dense connective tissue was observed, and its surface was covered with mesothelial cells. However, there were only a few microvilli, and the basement membrane was incomplete. After implantation of the EPTFE sheet, only a multilayer structure of dense connective tissue was observed. The connective tissue was exposed without mesothelial cells on its surface. Thus, pericardial repair and regeneration were induced by implantation of a sheet produced by dehydrothermal cross-linking, which does not impair the chemical properties of collagen purified from human amnion.","Kyoto Univ, Dept Artificial Organs, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 606, Japan",,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,2,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-4947,,,TISSUE ENG,Tissue Eng.,SUM,1998.0,4,2,,,,,131,141,,10.1089/ten.1998.4.131,,,,11,Cell & Tissue Engineering,Cell Biology,ZY304,WOS:000074606700002,,,,,2019-02-25

Well correlated second-order models are fitted to determine the extraction yields of arsenobetaine (AsBet), a probable arsenosugar (AsS), monomethylarsonate (MMA), dimethylarsinate (DMA) and As (V). By using focused microwaves the time of sample preparation is much shorter than in other methods. At powers close to 40 W with exposure times less than 4 min in methanol/water (55/45), the whole extraction yield reaches 85%.

The thermal parameters were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). While heating rates and sample size had strong effects on thermal properties, the influences of cooling rates were minor. For DSC, broad melting transitions were obtained at faster heating and/or slower cooling rates and larger sample sizes. Higher melting temperatures were obtained when heating rates and sample size were increased. Slower cooling rates also produced higher melting and crystallization temperatures. Faster cooling rates yielded lower heats of fusion during melting and also lower heats of crystallization. The dependence of peak melting and crystallization temperatures on the heating and cooling rates are illustrated by two empirical formulas. For TGA, it is found that faster heating rates and larger sample sizes produced higher decomposition temperatures. This detailed analysis may explain the large variations in the reported data on thermal properties and crystallinity of UHMWPE and provide solutions to the current clinical problems associated with polymeric biomaterials.

Although the metal sequestering capabilities of biomaterials have been known, a general inability to accurately predict their binding characteristics has been a barrier to their implementation in remediation schemes. Of interest in our laboratory are the binding mechanisms as well as basic chemistry involved in the metal uptake of the material derived from fragments of cell walls from cultured cells from the plant D. innoxia. Previous studies have suggested the dependency of lead-ion affinity distributions of the biomaterial upon solution variables (i.e., ionic strength, pH) to be the result of two classes of binding sites: low-affinity sites involving sulfonates and carboxylates in an ion-exchange process and high-affinity sites resulting from the coordination of carboxylates to the metal. This hypothesis has been further investigated by the removal of the dominant functionality on the biomaterial (carboxylates) by carboxyl esterification by mildly acidic methanol. The resulting modified biomaterial was then studied in terms of affinity distributions toward proton and lead ions. The content of sulfonates on the biomaterial was found to be 43 mu mol/g. A total amount of carboxylates involved in Pb2+ binding was found to be 560 mu mol/g with 147 mu mol/g involved in an ion-exchange mechanism and coordination sites including 212 mu mol/g biomaterial.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biochem & Chem, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Rayson, GD (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biochem & Chem, Box 30001 MSC 3C, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",,,,,,,39,46,52,1,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

The results of different procedures (perpendicular and parallel to the cartilage surface) in young and young-adult animals were analyzed: septal incision at different locations (young-old), cricoid split (young-old), suturing cartilage, closing defects with autologous cartilage (young), biomaterials (young) and newly engineered cartilage in 4- and 24-week-old rabbits (series of ten animals). Cartilage of the young rabbit and child have similar hyaline cartilage with a varying distribution in thickness. Thinner areas are more susceptible to malformations. Incisions through younger cartilage give rise to some new cartilage formation covered by a new layer of perichondrium; through older, differentiated cartilage the incision causes superficial but permanent necrosis. Edges of cut cartilage mostly do heal by formation of fibrous junctions. This forms a weak spot, sensitive to deviations. The same fate goes for the healing between the autologous graft and the surrounding pre-existent cartilage. Trauma parallel to the surface, leads to inconsistent quantity of neocartilage. With ageing the wound healing and regenerative capacities decrease. In general, biomaterials are less accepted by the surrounding tissues and would impede further growth. Only newly engineered, and thus less differentiated (younger) cartilage of hyaline nature, appeared to be well accepted at the interface with the edges of a cartilage defect. There are indications that the release of growth factors might play a role in cartilage wound healing. In the child as well as the adult, wound healing of hyaline cartilage structures is incomplete, and surgery remains 'experimental' surgery. The clinical implications of gradual loss of the regenerative capacity of hyaline cartilage should be further investigated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It is now accepted that nitrates can interact with many plastics and other biomaterials, but no work has been published on dialysis membranes. Accordingly, we studied the influence of dialysis, and in particular the influence of the nature of the membrane on the plasma concentration and the elimination of ISDN and its two active metabolites, isosorbide 2- and 5-mononitrates (2- and 5-ISMN). We simulated dialysis in vitro, to study the influence of seven different membranes on the levels of these nitrates. The concentrations of the three nitrates were measured upstream and downstream of the membrane (A and B, respectively), and in the ultrafiltrate (C), at times 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60'. Significant differences in concentration were found for ISDN in the three sample solutions A, B and C against time with the polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile, cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate. These differences are apparently due to an interaction of ISDN with these membranes. In addition, significant differences in ISDN concentrations were observed between the polysulfone membrane and the polyacrylonitrile, hemophan and cuprophan membranes. However, these differences diminished with time and were no longer significant after I h. There was no significant difference in 2- and 5-ISMN concentrations in time between any of the sample solutions that could be attributed to metabolite-membrane interactions, or between different membranes.

The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate the role of the local bacteriologic flora in its occurrence. Methods and Results-Specimens were collected at the site of implantation for culture from the skin and the pocket before and after insertion in a consecutive series of patients who underwent elective permanent pacemaker implantation. Microorganisms isolated both at the time of insertion and of any potentially infective complication were compared by using conventional speciation and ribotyping. There were 103 patients (67 men and 36 women) whose age ranged from 16 to 93 years (mean+/-SD, 67+/-15). At the time of pacemaker implantation, a total of 267 isolates were identified. The majority (85%) were staphylococci. During a mean follow-up of 16.5 months (range, 1 to 24), infection occurred in four patients (3.9%). In two of them, an isolate of Staphylococcus schleiferi was recognized by molecular method as identical to the one previously found in the pacemaker pocket. In one patient, Staphylococcus aureus, an organism that was absent at the time of pacemaker insertion, was isolated. In another patient, a Staphylococcus epidermidis was identified both at the time of pacemaker insertion and when erosion occurred; however, their antibiotic resistance profiles were different. Conclusions-This study strongly supports the hypothesis that pacemaker-related infections are mainly due to local contamination during implantation. S schleiferi appears to play an underestimated role in infectious colonization of implanted biomaterials and should be regarded as an important opportunistic pathogen.","Hop Cardiovasc & Pneumol Louis Pradel, Serv Cardiol, F-69394 Lyon 03, France; Hop Cardiovasc & Pneumol Louis Pradel, Bacteriol Lab, F-69394 Lyon 03, France","Touboul, P (reprint author), Hop Cardiovasc & Pneumol Louis Pradel, Serv Cardiol, BP Lyon Montchat, F-69394 Lyon 03, France.",,"ETIENNE, Jerome/C-5471-2014; Vandenesch, Francois/C-7209-2014","ETIENNE, Jerome/0000-0002-3348-3315; Vandenesch, Francois/0000-0001-9412-7106",,,,19,101,105,1,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0009-7322,1524-4539,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,MAY 12,1998.0,97,18,,,,,1791,1795,,10.1161/01.CIR.97.18.1791,,,,5,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,ZM245,WOS:000073519200008,9603533.0,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

TMA-gly:CPH (50:50) produced moderate inflammatory reactions characterized by macrophages and edema. PMA-ala:CPH matrices elicited minimal inflammatory reactions that were characterized by fibrous encapsulation by the end of 60 days. In vivo degradation rates of poly(anhydride-co-imides) were similar to PLAGA. Both PMA:ala:CPH and TMA-gly:CPH matrices maintained their shapes and degraded at a constant rate over the period of two months. These polymers, possessing good mechanical properties and tissue compatibility, may be useful in weight-bearing applications in bone. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Long-term failure mechanisms for polyethylene in total hip arthoplasty (THA) differ from those seen in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) although the same materials are used.

Low (20-40%) and high (70-90%) crystallinity hydroxyapatite (rHA and cHA), rough titanium (Ti), and tissue culture polystyrene (TP) surfaces were compared. Surface chemistry and calcium resorption of HA coatings, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and growth of cells were measured for Matrigel(R)-coated and uncoated surfaces at 2, 7, and 14 days. Gene expression for four noncollagenous bone-related proteins (osteonectin, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin) was also investigated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction up to 28 days. Ca concentration in incubating solutions increased with time for the two types of HA coatings and was always greater for rHA than cHA. Surface chemistry and coating dissolution rates were not affected by the presence of Matrigel(R) or cells throughout the study. APA of cells on the two HA-coated surfaces was comparably enhanced in the presence of Matrigel(R) and was greater than on Ti surfaces. Only HA surfaces showed an increased APA of cells with time in the presence of Matrigel(R). Cell growth peaked at 7 days and was greatest for cells on the two HA surfaces and without Matrigel(R). At 14 days, cell growth was comparable on the four surfaces. The presence of HA and Matrigel(R) enhanced cell-specific APA at 14 days. Gene expression for all four proteins investigated showed no differences between surfaces after 7 days. At 2 and 7 days,gene expression was indicative of proliferation for Ti, and of proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization for HA and TP more so without Matrigel(R). The addition of this matrix significantly enhanced mitogenicity of calvarial cells on HA only after 14 days. Matrigel(R) eliminated differences seen between the two HA coatings. Gene expression was not enhanced or inhibited by the presence of Matrigel(R).

Currently, tissue engineering offers the possibility of performing a suitable therapeutic wound coverage after early burn excision by using cultured keratinocyte sheets supported by a dermal layer. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a skin substitute composed of both epidermal and dermal elements. For this purpose we grew keratinocytes and fibroblasts separately for 15 days within two different types of biomaterials. Cells then were co-cultured for an additional period of 15 days, after which samples were taken and processed with either classic or immunohistochemical stainings. Results showed that (1) human fibroblasts and keratinocytes can be cultured on hyaluronic acid-derived biomaterials and that (2) the pattern of expression of particular dermal-epidermal molecules is similar to that found in normal skin. The data from this study suggest that our skin equivalent might be useful in the treatment of both bums and chronic wounds.

Human bone marrow cells have been chosen because these cells are in direct contact with the biomaterial after implantation in situ. The sensitivity of this method is evaluated for materials which are already being used as implants in humans and animal, e.g., hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic, pure titanium, and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). As indicative parameters of biocompatibility primary cell adherence, cell number, cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix, cell vitality, and cell differentiation are described. After 2 weeks in culture, obvious differences between the biomaterials with respect to the indicative parameters could be observed. Cell numbers were greatest on the HA specimens. Ln the case of titanium alloys, we observed a decreased number of cells. The production of extracellular matrix was high for the HA ceramics but reduced for titanium specimens. The polymers allowed only a few adherent cells and showed no signs of extracellular matrix production. The results can be correlated astonishingly well to animal experiments and clinical experiences. Therefore, we suggest that this cell culture system seems to be a useful tool for biocompatibility testing of bone implantation materials. It also helps reduce animal experiments. With the help of flow cytophotometry, we analyzed the influence of biomaterials on large numbers of cells with respect to differentiation. There were similar populations of T cells and monocytes on all specimens tested. Extended B-cell and granulocyte populations, however, were observed with titanium and UHMWPE. Most osteocalcin-containing cells adhered to the HA ceramics.

In order to improve the integration of implants, it is desirable to control interfacial reactions such that nonspecific adsorption of proteins is minimized and tissue-healing phenomena can be controlled. In this regard, our goal has been do develop a method to functionalize oxidized titanium surfaces by the covalent immobilization of bioactive organic molecules. Titanium first was chemically treated with a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate surface contaminants and to produce a consistent and reproducible titanium oxide surface layer. An intermediary aminoalkylsilane spacer molecule was then covalently Linked to the oxide layer, followed by the covalent binding of either alkaline phosphatase or albumin to the free terminal NH2 groups using glutaraldehyde as a coupling agent. Surface analyses following coating procedures consisted of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Enzymatic activity of coupled alkaline phosphatase was assayed colorimetrically, and surface coverage by bound albumin was evaluated by SEM visualization of colloidal gold immunolabeling. Our results indicate that the linkage of the aminoalkylsilane to the oxidized surface is stable and that bound proteins such alkaline phosphatase and albumin retain their enzymatic activity and antigenicity, respectively. The density of immunolabeling for albumin suggests that the binding and surface coverage obtained is in excess of what would be expected for inducing biological activity. In conclusion, this method offers the possibility of covalently Linking selected molecules with known biological activity to oxidized titanium surfaces in order to guide and promote the tissue healing that occurs during implant integration in bone and soft tissues.

In this context, calcium-phosphate ceramics present similar degradation processes in vivo and in vitro to those found in a natural calcified substrate. As the monocyte/macrophage lineage is among the first cells to appear in ceramic implantation sites, it is a key protagonist in inflammatory reaction and biodegradation mechanisms. This study investigated the ability of human monocytes/macrophages activated by various agents [Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), polymyxin B (PMB)] to degrade biphasic calcium-phosphate ceramics. PMB sulfate is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that modulates LPS-induced cell activities in vivo and in vitro. Degradation pits (about 10 mu m) produced on the pellet surface by these monocytes were discrete, with well defined margins. LPS increased the degradation of calcium-phosphate ceramic (number of lacunae, mean pellet surface area degraded) in a dose-dependent manner whereas polymyxin B downmodulated it significantly. The addition of 2 mu g/mL of polymyxin B reduced the number of degradation lacunae and the extent of degraded surface area induced by 0.1 mu g/mL, LPS by 87% and 64%, respectively. Thus this cell culture system can be very useful in the study of cellular degradation of biomaterials and of the influence of therapeutic agents that may modulate these cell activities.

They seem to be involved in osteoclast activation and bone resorption and probably play a role in osseointegrated implant rejection. In this study we investigate the ability of titanium implants to cause an imbalance in the homeostatic equilibrium of cytokines using the peritoneal cavity of DB-A2 mice as a model. The inflammatory response was evaluated as a messenger ribonucleic acid expression determined by the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique in peritoneal macrophages from titanium-implanted mice. Interleukin-6 release was detected by a specific quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results have shown that titanium implants do not significantly stimulate the proinflammatory cytokine system compared to the control group. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test confirms, after a peak in secretion at day 1 compared with basal levels, a clear decrease in interleukin-6 at basal levels on following control at 6 and 9 days after implantation. The study of the interaction between implanted biomaterials and inflammatory mediators seems to be very promising. Perhaps a better understanding of the mechanisms of bone resorption could lead to finding a new clinical solution for patients with osseointegrated implant rejection.","Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Surg, Plast & Reconstruct Surg Sect, Rome, Italy; CNR, Inst Tissue Typing & Dialysis, Rome, Italy","Giudiceandrea, F (reprint author), Via Paola Falconieri 110, I-00152 Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,28,8,8,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1049-2275,,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

Cross-linking agents have been applied routinely to reduce host-tissue response, including antigenicity, and to improve tissue leaflet durability. Evaluation of improvements in bovine pericardial valve leaflet calcification and flexibility require that in vitro systems be developed to correlate data with results from in vivo studies. This study describes an in vitro test system used to evaluate the effects of two surface-modifying treatments on pericardial tissue hemocompatibility. Methods: Non-fixed and glutaraldehyde fixation-processed (GA) bovine pericardial tissues were exposed to anticoagulated whole blood for 60 min. Blood was then removed, and platelet-poor plasma prepared and frozen at -70 degrees C until analyzed for kallikrein activation and release of platelet factor 4 (PF4). Blood-exposed tissue samples were analyzed for fibrin(ogen) binding with an anti-fibrinogen antibody and for tissue cellular responsiveness (blood cell adherence and aggregation) by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Conditions were determined for minimum extent of pumping action by the minicam system required to allow for solution movement while not tearing or wearing the tissue. A blood-tissue exposure time of 60 min provided sufficient first-pass exposure to evaluate the acute blood-tissue response. The relative degree of both kallikrein activation and PF4 release was greater in the non-fixed tissue but a greater number of fibrin(ogen) molecules per cm(2) was found on GA-treated tissue. Scanning electron microscopy showed a differential cell response of non-fixed tissue compared with GA-treated tissue. Conclusion: This non-static test system demonstrated great promise for use in routine in vitro hemocompatibility testing of blood-contacting biological biomaterials.","Baxter Int, CRTS, Round Lake, IL 60073 USA; Baxter Healthcare Corp, Edwards CVS Div, Irvine, CA USA","Amrani, DL (reprint author), Baxter Int, CRTS, RLT-12,Route 120 & Wilson Rd, Round Lake, IL 60073 USA.",,,,,,,15,1,2,0,1,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD, ENGLAND HA6 2ET",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

A variety of anticalcification treatments has been proposed but none has proved to prevent calcific degeneration. The study aim was to evaluate, in vitro, the time course of calcium uptake of porcine and bovine biomaterials and the efficacy of anticalcification treatments. Methods: Samples of glutaraldehyde-tanned biomaterials with (Carpentier-Edwards, Medtronic Intact, Hancock II, MZGTB) or without anticalcification treatment (Mitroflow) were incubated with culture medium containing physiological calcium levels. Specimens were then analyzed at two, four or eight weeks for their calcium content (mg/g wet weight). Results: All specimens calcified over time, though the time courses for each were significantly different. Mitroflow and Intact valves accumulated high calcium levels rapidly during the first two weeks, with small further increases thereafter. Anticalcification treatment reduced calcium uptake of Carpentier-Edwards material during the first two weeks of incubation, but the material gradually attained comparable calcium levels at eight weeks. Hancock valves and the self-customized MZGTB valve showed the lowest calcium levels over the test period. Conclusions: This in vitro study documented major differences in calcium uptake of different biomaterials. Some anticalcification treatments render the material temporarily less susceptible to calcium binding but none can prevent calcification. In vitro testing has proved to be a valuable instrument for evaluating anticalcification treatments, but should be combined with evaluation of bioprosthesis surface interaction with circulating blood.","Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Cardiothorac & Vasc Surg, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Med Stat, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Biochem, D-55131 Mainz, Germany","Dahm, M (reprint author), Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Cardiothorac & Vasc Surg, Langenbeckstr 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.",,,,,,,25,3,3,0,1,I C R PUBLISHERS,NORTHWOOD,"CRISPIN HOUSE, 12/A SOUTH APPROACH, MOOR PARK, NORTHWOOD, ENGLAND HA6 2ET",0966-8519,,,J HEART VALVE DIS,J.

From the original description of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH), new techniques such as continuous venous venous hemofiltration (CAVH), hemodiafiltration (HDF) and high flux dialysis (HFD) have been developed and clinically utilized. A parallel improvement in efficiency has been achieved with daily clearances of urea as high as 50 liters or more. The use of special highly permeable dialyzers has also permitted increases in the clearances of large solutes, thus leading to significant removals of chemical substances involved the acute inflammation and sepsis. In this field, recent observations have suggested the use of hemofiltration with high volumes of fluid exchange. The hardware and software of the newer continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) systems are certainly the key points in achieving these results and in safely performing such challenging techniques.","St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy; Austin & Repatriat Med Ctr, Intens Care Unit, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia","Ronco, C (reprint author), St Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,25,42,45,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0085-2538,,,KIDNEY INT,Kidney Int.,MAY,1998.0,53,,,66,,,S160,S164,,,,,,5,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,ZK108,WOS:000073285700032,9573595.0,,,,2019-02-25

For instance, phonation threshold pressure, a measure of the ""ease"" of phonation, has been shown to be directly related to the viscosity of the vibrating mucosa. Various implantable biomaterials have been used in vocal fold augmentation surgery, with implantation sites sometimes close to or inside the mucosa. Yet their viscosities or other mechanical properties are seldom known. This study attempts to provide data on viscosities of commonly used phonosurgical biomaterials. Using a parallel-plate rotational rheometer, oscillatory shear experiments were performed on implantable polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon or Polytef; Mentor Inc., Hingham, MA), collagen (Zyderm; Collagen Corp., Pale Alto, CA), glutaraldehyde crosslinked (GAX) collagen (Phonagel or Zyplast; Collagen Corp.), absorbable gelatin (Gelfoam; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI), and human abdominal subcutaneous fat. Samples of human vocal fold mucosal tissues were also tested, Under sinusoidal oscillatory shear at 10 Hz and at 37 degrees C, the dynamic viscosity was 116 Pascal-seconds (Pa-s) for polytetrafluoroethylene, 21 Pa-s for gelatin, 8-13 Pa-s for the two types of collagen, 3 Pa-s for fat, and 1 to 3 Pa-s for vocal fold mucosa. Results extrapolated to 100 Hz also show similar differences among the biomaterials, but all values are an order of magnitude lower because of the typical inverse frequency relation (shear thinning effect) for polymeric and biologic materials. The data suggest that the use of fat for vocal fold augmentation may be more conducive to the ""ease"" of phonation because of its relatively low viscosity, which is closest to physiologic levels. This implication is probably the most relevant in predicting initial outcome of the postoperative voice before there is any significant assimilation (e.g., resorption and fibrosis) of the implanted biomaterial.","Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Chan, RW (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Speech Pathol & Audiol, Natl Ctr Voice & Speech, 330 WJSHC, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [P60 DC00976],,,38,110,114,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-852X,1531-4995,,LARYNGOSCOPE,Laryngoscope,MAY,1998.0,108,5,,,,,725,731,,10.1097/00005537-199805000-00019,,,,7,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Otorhinolaryngology",Research & Experimental Medicine; Otorhinolaryngology,ZM323,WOS:000073527000019,9591554.0,,,,2019-02-25

The cyclic conformation of the RGD motif grafted on the protein mimics the conformation of the motif displayed in native adhesion proteins such as fibronectin. The adhesion of the cells on polystyrene coated with the conjugate BSA-peptide was similar or even better than the one obtained when the proadhesive protein fibronectin was coated on the plates. Results also indicated that covalent coupling of the peptide on BSA is not absolutely required, since simple adsorption of the peptide on the protein coated on plates was efficient for enhancing cell adhesion. These results show that polystyrene support can be reconditioned with conformationally constrained RGD peptides to enhance cell adhesion on solid supports. The same methodology can be adapted for the development of new biomaterials based on the recognition of specific peptides.","Fac Univ Notre Dame Paix, Lab Cellular Biochem, B-5000 Namur, Belgium",,,,,,,,19,18,20,0,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0929-5666,,,LETT PEPT SCI,Lett.

To evaluate this approach, we prepared novel polyurethane matrices loaded with hirudin and coated them with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) by glow discharge plasma deposition (GDPD) to reduce the release rate. Methods. Polyurethane (BioSpan(R)) matrices containing hirudin and pore former (d-mannitol or BSA) were prepared by the solvent casting method. HEMA plasma deposition was then applied using GDPD technique to create a diffusional barrier film on the surface of the matrices. The effect of pore former and HEMA plasma coating on the release of hirudin was systematically investigated. Surface properties of matrices was also studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA). Results, The release of hirudin from BioSpan(R) matrix could be controlled by changing the weight fraction and particle size of pore former HEMA plasma treatment of matrices produced a thin, highly crosslinked film on the surface. The initial burst and subsequent release of hirudin was significantly reduced after HEMA plasma coating, which suggested that the plasma disposition acted as a diffusional barrier and limited the release of hirudin incorporated in the polyurethane matrix. Conclusions, The plasma coating served as a diffusional barrier, and could work to control the release kinetics of hirudin by changing the various plasma coating conditions. Local delivery of hirudin using these biomaterials at the site of cardiovascular diseases can have the advantage of regional high levels of hirudin, as well as lowering systemic hirudin exposure, thereby minimizing the possibility of side effects.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Pusan Natl Univ, Coll Pharm, Pusan 609735, South Korea","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Box 351750, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Kim, Dae Duk/D-8864-2013",,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 51260],,,13,11,11,0,7,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,,,PHARMACEUT RES,Pharm.

This approach enables us to make a clear analysis of the flow direction of the carbon fluxes in the metabolic pathways as well as of the degree of activation of a particular pathway for the synthesis of biomaterials for cell growth. The analyses demonstrate that the main metabolic pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae change significantly during batch culture. Carbon flow direction is toward glycolysis to satisfy the increase of requirement for precursors and energy. The enzymatic activation of TCA cycle seems to always be at normal level, which may result in the overflow of ethanol due to its limited capacity. The advantage of this approach is that it adopts both virtues of the metabolic signal flow diagram and the simple network analysis method, focusing on the investigation of the flow directions of carbon fluxes and the degree of activation of a particular pathway or reaction loop. All of the variables used in the model equations were determined an-line; the information obtained from the calculated metabolic coefficients may result in a better understanding of cell physiology and help to evaluate the state of the cell culture process.

Enrichment can govern both the surface chemistry and morphology of such surfaces. Here, we present new information on the surface enrichment of components from a biodegradable polymer blend composed of poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA). This information, derived by phase-detection imaging atomic force microscopy (AFM), defines both the surface chemistry and morphology. We demonstrate that phase-detection imaging can distinguish between microdomains of PSA and PLA in blends of these biodegradable polymers. Contrast between these two polymers is achieved even when the microdomains cannot be distinguished on surface topography images. The relationship between the force of tapping of the AFM probe on the polymer surface and the image contrast mechanism is investigated. In addition to detecting chemical and mechanical variations on polymer blend surfaces, phase-detection imaging can improve the resolution and contrast of images on single-component films. This is demonstrated by the identification of lamellae with widths of less than 5 nm within PSA spherulites.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; Ortho Clin Diagnost, Pollards Wood Labs, Chalfont St Giles HP8 4SP, Bucks, England; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Sch Pharm, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel","Davies, MC (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Biophys & Surface Anal, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Williams, Philip/C-6947-2009; Roberts, Clive/C-6970-2009","Williams, Philip/0000-0002-1822-2133; Roberts, Clive/0000-0001-9443-3445; Shakesheff, Kevin/0000-0003-3236-2439; Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,29,61,66,4,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,APR 7,1998.0,31,7,,,,,2278,2283,,10.1021/ma9704525,,,,6,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,ZH163,WOS:000073079100034,,,,,2019-02-25

The surface structures of both the grafted membranes and the PP membrane were observed by using FTIR-PAS and ESCA methods. The X-ray diffraction diagrams of the PP and PP-g-HEMA membranes indicated a transformation process of the p-form toward the ct-form crystallinity with increasing degree of grafting. The SEM data of the membrane grafted under a low grafting temperature showed many spheres of PHEMA embedded in the PP matrix, whose size was well distributed and increased with the degree of grafting. The influences of the degree of grafting and grafting temperature on the permeabilities of PP-g-HEMA membranes toward urea and creatinine were studied in a dialyzer. In all cases, the PP-g-HEMA membrane obtained under higher grafting temperature showed higher permeability toward those solutes. The permeation coefficients of urea and creatinine through the PP-g-HEMA membrane obtained at 59 degrees C were about 10.4 and 28.8 times that through the PP membrane, respectively.

The physical strengths and behaviour of these fabrics under different external forces were measured for such stress-strain relationships as compressive, tensile and cyclic bending, compressing torsional and compressive tensile systems to evaluate the effect of the continuous loading caused by living body movements over a long period of time. The 3-DFs led to downward convex 'J'-shaped curves in stress-strain profiles, because they were markedly flexible at low strain levels, but became rigid as strain increased. In this behaviour they reflected the behaviour of natural cartilage rather than that of conventional artificial biomaterials. There were also some 3-DFs that showed hysteresis loss curves with quite similar mechanical strengths and behaviour to natural intervertebral discs with regard to the compressive-tensile cyclic stress and showed little variation from the first 'J'-shaped hysteresis profile even after 100, 000 deformation cycles. Accordingly, it has been shown that, without a doubt, 3-DFs can be effective implants possessing both design and mechanical biocompatibilities as well as the durability necessary for long-term implantation in the living body. The surface of bioinert linear low-density polyethylene coating on multifilaments of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, a constructional fibre of 3A-3D weaving, was modified by treatment with corona-discharge and spray-coating of unsintered hydroxyapatite powder to impart chemical (surface) compatibility and biological activity, respectively. Since the modified surface of the 3-DF was ascertained to have affinity and activity with simulated body fluid, an orthogonal 3-DF block was implanted in the tibia of a rabbit. Sufficient surrounding tissues entering into the textural space of the 3-DF could be observed at 4 weeks after implantation and the load necessary to break the block away from the bone reached a high value at 8 weeks. These results decisively showed that the 3-DFs could also acquire chemical (surface) and biological biocompatibilities and bonding capacity with bone and soft tissues through modification of the surface of the constructional fibre. The 3-DFs have definite potential in such applications as novel and effective artificial articular cartilages, intervertebral discs, menisci and materials for osteosynthesis and prosthesis, and the like.

Several polypropylene (PP) prostheses are currently available which differ in the number of PP filaments, the type of weave and the porosity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the integration, adhesion formation and resistance to traction of three types of PP prostheses (Marlex(R), Trelex(R) and Prolene(R)) used in the partial or total repair of abdominal wall defects. Abdominal wall defects (7 x 5 cm) were created in 54 New Zealand rabbits involving all the tissue layers (total substitutions (TS); n = 27) or all layers excluding the parietal peritoneum (partial substitutions (PS); it = 27). The defects were repaired with PP monofilament prostheses of different weave (1 mm porosity) (Marlex, n = 18; Trelex, n = 18) or bifilament (2 mm porosity) (Prolene; n = 18). They were placed in contact on one side with subcutaneous tissue and on the other with abdominal viscera or parietal peritoneum. Animals were killed at 30, 60 and 90 days and samples of prosthesis and scar tissue processed for light and scanning microscopy. The adhesion formation with viscera was evaluated. Resistance to traction was measured with a tensiometer using strips including the prosthesis and anchorage tissue. Adhesions were detected in all the TS and in four PS. Microscopic analysis revealed total integration of the TS samples by fibrous and disorganized tissue. Prostheses used for PS were integrated by white adipose tissue with the exception of the areas around the mesh nodes and anchorage zones. The foreign body reaction could be seen as a moderate accumulation of white blood cells. Tensiometric analysis showed an increase in resistance to traction with time (P < 0.001) in each type of prosthesis, but no differences were detected (P > 0.001) between them. We concluded that: (a) the formation of adhesions was almost inhibited when the parietal peritoneum was left intact; (b) in both TS and PS, polypropylene prostheses integrated completely although the composition of the scar tissue was seem to differ; and (c) resistance to traction was similar in both TS and PS.

The mechanical properties of the films are greatly affected by the presence of hydroxyapatite and change as a function of inorganic phase content. On stretching, the long axis of the collagen molecular portions align parallel to the direction of deformation and the gelatin coarse layered structure becomes more evident and ordered. Furthermore, under deformation the inorganic crystals, which are embedded in the gelatin layers, seem to squeeze out in the interlayer spaces and assume a preferential orientation parallel to the force trajectories. Thus, as the inorganic phase stiffens the gelatin films, the macromolecular matrix distributes the stress promoting the preferential orientation of the apatitic crystals. The results indicate that this experimental approach can be used to prepare composites with anisotropic properties, which can be modulated through variation in composition and mechanical deformation in order to get biomaterials suitable to fulfill specific mechanical functions.

For the development of new biomaterials with superior biocompatibility, quantitative evaluation of the materials' affinity for cells is necessary. One of the methods to evaluate the materials' affinity for cells quantitatively is to measure the detachment force of an adherent cell on a material. In this study, a new system was developed to measure directly the shear force necessary to detach a cell from a material. Using a microcantilever, the detachment force was measured in the cell culture medium by applying a lateral load to the cell which adhered to the material. During the measurement, the cell was observed using an optical microscope and the image of the cell was recorded on a video tape through a CCD camera. The cell adhesive area before detaching the cell was measured by analyzing the obtained video image of the cell. Reproducibility of the measurement was demonstrated by repeating the measurement of the shear forces to detach murine fibroblasts 1,929 incubated for 24 h on glass. The average shear strength, which is a detachment force per unit cell adhesive area, is 530-750 Pa, varying with the day of cell preparation. However, the shear strengths of the cells seeded at the same time into separate dishes are corresponding well to each other. This fact suggests that it is possible to compare the materials' affinity for cells using this system if the cells were seeded at the same time onto different materials.

Defects were prepared in the edentulous area on both sides of the maxillas in 22 rabbits. The rabbits were divided into three groups. Gore-Tex(R) augmentation material (GTAM) (ePTFE)-barriers were placed to cover the experimental defects and compared with totally occlusive or perforated titanium foils and uncovered control defects respectively. After four weeks of healing, histological analyses and morphometrical measurements demonstrated that the amount of regenerated bone tissue was about the same underneath the collapsed GTAM-barriers as in the controls. The highest degree of regeneration was obtained in defects underneath the titanium foils, particularly if they were perforated, whether or not they were covered by GTAM-barriers. It was concluded that the space-maintaining properties of a barrier may be at least as important as barrier occlusiveness when regenerating bone defects.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Biomat Handicap Res, Inst Surg Sci, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; Inst Postgrad Dent Educ, Dept Periodontol, Jonkoping, Sweden","Lundgren, AK (reprint author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Biomat Handicap Res, Inst Surg Sci, Medicinaregatan 8, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,24,39,41,0,1,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0901-5027,1399-0020,,INT J ORAL MAX SURG,Int.

However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have empirically examined academic scientists' experience with research-related gifts from companies. Objective.-To examine the frequency, importance, and potential implications of research-related gifts from companies to academic life scientists. Design.-A mailed survey conducted in 1994 and 1995 of 3394 faculty who conduct life science research at the 50 universities that received the most research funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1993. Setting.-Research-intensive universities. Participants.-A total of 2167 of the 3394 faculty responded to the survey (response rate, 64%). Main Outcome Measures.-The percentage of faculty who received a research-related gift from a company in the last 3 years, the perceived importance of gifts to respondents' research, and what, if anything, the recipient thought the donor(s) expected in return for the gift. Results.-Forty-three percent of respondents received a research-related gift in the last 3 years independent of a grant or contract. The most frequently received gifts were biomaterials (24%), discretionary funds (15%), research equipment and trips to meetings (11% each), support for students (9%), and other research-related gifts (3%). Of those who received a gift, 66% reported the gift was important to their research, More than half of the recipients reported that donors expected the following in return for the gift: acknowledgment in publications (63%), that the gift not be passed on to a third party (60%), and that the gift be used only for the agreed-on purposes (59%). A total of 32% of recipients reported that the donor wanted prepublication review of any articles or reports stemming from the use of the gift, 30% indicated the company expected testing of their products, and 19% indicated that a donor expected ownership of all patentable results from the research in which a gift was used. However, what recipients thought donors expected differed by the type of gift received. Conclusions.-Research-related gifts are a common and important form of research support for academic life scientists. However, recipients frequently think that donors place restrictions and expect returns that may be problematic for recipients as well as institutions.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Hlth Policy Res & Dev Unit, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Partners Healthcare Syst Inc, Boston, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Minnesota, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Minneapolis, MN USA","Campbell, EG (reprint author), Med Practices Evaluat Ctr, Hlth Policy Res & Dev Unit, 50 Staniford St,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",,,"Seashore, Karen/0000-0003-1070-0273",NHGRI NIH HHS [HG00724-01],,,12,85,87,0,3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0098-7484,,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

While the requirements of mechanical properties can be reached by suitable organo-polymeric and inorganic materials the interfacial biocompatiblity is neither understood in all its complexity nor can be fulfilled by any of the applied materials. Surface modification and characterization with greatest scrutiny and the observation of the answer of selected parameters of the biosystem are a subject of utmost interest. A few examples will be presented. In the long range, however, it has to be considered that any material is degraded and hence should present continuously a renewable biocompatible surface. On the other hand, materials are desired which deliberately are biodegradable. Presently available materials are polylactides and copolymers. An alternative could be presented by polydepsipeptides because of two reasons, (i) the local concentration of acid formed upon degradation would be reduced as compared to polylactides which in certain cases might be advantageous and (ii) the aminoacid units could carry side groups with bioactive molecules attached. Therefore, a new method of acylation of an aminoacid with a hydroxyacid is presented as well as the cyclisation to result in the cyclic depsipeptide and the polymerisation to yield the polydepsipeptide. The microstructure of the polymers, the thermal properties and the degradation behaviour is presented.","Univ Technol Aachen, Ctr Competence Biomat, Aachen, Germany; Univ Technol Aachen, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res, Aachen, Germany","Hocker, H (reprint author), Univ Technol Aachen, Ctr Competence Biomat, Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,6,6,6,0,10,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",1022-1360,,,MACROMOL SYMP,Macromol.

In vitro IMC release from the 1, 2 and 5% drug-loaded apatite cement systems in simulated body fluid (SBF) (pH 7.25) at 37 degrees C increased with increasing concentrations of IMC and with decreasing geometrical size of the cement. The plots of in vitro IMC release per unit area against the square root of time increased with increasing IMC concentrations, but not with decreasing geometrical size of the cement. After subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of differently sized 1% IMC-loaded cements in male Wistar rats, the plasma IMC concentration and the area under the curve increased with decreasing cement diameter. The in vivo IMC release profiles of the cement were deconvoluted from the plasma IMC profiles after s.c. administration of IMC solution. The plots of in vivo IMC release per unit area against the square root of time suggested that the initial release from all 1% drug-loaded cements was very rapid, slowed after one day, but continued for over two weeks.

Covalent binding was achieved in a two-step procedure: First, TGF-beta 2 was reacted with the difunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker, and then the PEG-attached TGF-beta 2 (PEG-TGF-beta 2) was bound to the fibrillar collagen (FC-PEG-TGF-beta 2). Initial binding of TGF-beta 2 to difunctional succinimidyl glutarate (D-SG-PEG) or succinimidyl propionate polyethylene glycol (D-SE-PEG) linkers was completed after reacting for 8 or 10 min as monitored by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. After reaction with injectable fibrillar collagen, extraction of unbound PEG-TGF-beta 2 and Western blot analysis, using a TGF-beta specific antibody, demonstrated that at least 85% of the TGF-beta 2 was bound to the fibrillar collagen. The activity of PEG-TGF-beta 2 was fully stable in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C for at least up to 4 weeks. Unmodified TGF-beta 2 mixed with fibrillar collagen was completely inactivated after 1 week of incubation, as measured by the mink lung epithelial cell (Mv1Lu) growth inhibition assay. Formulations of FC-PEG-TGF-beta 2 containing 40 mu g/mL TGF-beta 2 were implanted subcutaneously into rats and analyzed after days 7, 21, and 42. All TGF-beta 2-containing formulations showed. the TGF-beta typical fibroblastic response at the day 7 time point. Covalent binding of TGF-beta 2 to collagen with both difunctional PEG crosslinkers resulted in a significantly stronger and longer-lasting TGF-beta 2 response than that observed with admired formulations of collagen and TGF-beta. The TGF-beta response with FC-PEG-TGF-beta 2 lasted up to day 42 but was not seen after day 7 for TGF-beta 2 admired to FC. These findings clearly demonstrate that TGF-beta 2 remains fully active after being covalently bound to collagen via difunctional PEG. In addition, covalent binding potentiates and prolongs in vivo TGF-beta responses and stabilizes the TGF-beta in vitro. Results suggest that this method of formulation could be useful to stabilize and deliver similar peptide growth factors or biologically active agents.

The expression of adhesion molecules analyzed by flow cytometry provides a simple method to evaluate leukocyte activation by biomaterials: any change in these molecules can be predictive of the inflammatory activity of the materials. In this study the contact between leukocytes and uncoated polyethylene terephthalate or pyrolytic carbon-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET and PET-PC, respectively) was inspected by analyzing whether the expression of some adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte activation, namely LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac 1/CR3 (CD11b/CD18), and LECAM-1 (CD62L) can be modified. By flow cytometry expression of the adhesion molecules can be studied separately on lymphocytes and myeloid cells. The materials tested reduced the total numbers of both leukocytes and neutrophils, although not significantly. Neither PET nor PET-PC changed the expression of the adhesion molecules in lymphocytes: this suggests that no specific immune response is stimulated. On the contrary, statistically significant changes were observed for monocytes and granulocytes: the percentage of cells expressing Mac-1 and the density of such antigens on cell membranes increased while the percentage of LECAM-1 positive cells decreased. Similar changes were observed when the cells underwent the inflammatory stimulus provided by an in vitro challenge with bacterial endotoxin. Our results demonstrated that polyethylene terephthalate activates leukocytes by modifying the expression in neutrophils of the molecules involved in the early phase of the inflammatory response. Even after coating PET with pyrolytic carbon, the ability of this material to activate circulating leukocytes was maintained.

In this study, the effects of 14 metal ions on histamine release from human blood basophils (n = 4), isolated tissue mast cells (lung n = 8, uterus n = 2, skin n = 1, gingiva n = 1), the basophil cell line KU-812, and the mast cell line HMC-1 were analyzed. Of the 14 metal ions, Ag+ (0.33 mM) and Hg2+ (0.33 mM) were found to induce release of histamine in blood basophils, KU-812 mast cells, and HMC-1. The effects of Ag+ and Hg2+ were dose dependent and were observed within 60 min of incubation. In primary mast cells and basophils, Au3+ (0.33 mM) also induced histamine release, whereas no effects of Au3+ on HMC-1 or KU-812 cells were seen. The other metal ions showed no effects on primary or immortal cells within 60 min. However, Pt4+ (0.33 mM) induced histamine liberation in HMC-1 and lung mast cells after 12 h. The Ag+ - and Hg2+-induced rapid release of histamine from HMC-1 was associated with ultrastructural signs of necrosis, but not apoptosis. In contrast, prolonged exposure to Pt4+ (0.33 mM, 14 h) induced apoptotic cell death in HMC-1 cells, as assessed by electron microscopy and DNA analysis. Together, certain metal ions induce distinct cytopathogenic effects in mast cells and basophils. Whereas Ag+, Hg2+, and Au3+ cause direct toxicity, Pt4+ causes cell death through induction of apoptosis. Whether such effects contribute to local adverse reactions to metal-containing biomaterials in vivo remains to be determined.

For this purpose, selected samples of the tissue were sewn with different types of commercially available sutures and subjected to tensile testing, the results of which were compared with the findings in selected, but not sutured, tissue used as a control. The results confirm a loss of resistance-that is, a reduction of the capacity of sutured samples of the biomaterial to withstand and breakage stress compared with control samples. Taking into account the marked resistance to breakage of the suture thread, this phenomenon can only be explained as a consequence of the deleterious mechanical interaction between the suture and chemically treated pericardium. This interaction is illustrated by the shearing force which is responsible for the loss of resistance in the tested samples. These trials demonstrate that the results can be improved and the deleterious interaction diminished, although not eliminated, when the pericardium is selected from a given region.

Both the sintered carbonate apatite and the bone apatite dissolved to an appreciable extent. Their solution compositions chanced in an almost identical manner until toward the end of the reaction. The solution compositions for sintered carbonate apatite at 30 s was comparable with that for sintered hydroxyapatite at 3.8 days with respect to the degree of supersaturation, indicating that the former specimen is much more soluble than the latter specimen. Osteoclasts which were obtained from the long bones of 1-day-old neonatal rabbits resorbed bone and sintered carbonate apatite, but not sintered hydroxyapatite. These findings suggest that sintered carbonate apatites, which have characteristics that can be favorably compared with those of bone, especially with respect to its reactivity to acid media, would be useful as bioresorbable bone substitutes.

Undecalcified interfacial tissues were serially sectioned from mandibular samples encasing 60 implants placed into 30 dogs. Two-dimensional ultrastructural analyses and three-dimensional stereology showed that osteogenesis adjacent to dental implants is a dynamic interaction of osseous cells and a collagenous fiber matrix. This study showed that the interfacial bone consists of a mineralized collagen fiber matrix associated with an inorganic (hydroxylapatite) matrix. This study suggested that an unmineralized collagen fiber matrix initially is laid down directly at the implant surface, and that this matrix then is mineralized. Osteoblasts interacted with this matrix, eventually becoming encased within developing lacunae during the remodeling process. This process formed the cellular (osteocyte) aspects of the developed bone. Osteocyte processes extended through canaliculi directly to the implant surface. Apparently, these processes also were entrapped within canaliculi during the mineralization events. At times, these processes paralleled the implant surface. The bone-implant interfacial zone was primarily fibrillar (both mineralized and unmineralized) in morphology, with an electron-dense, ruthenium positive deposition. This electron-dense material was approximately 20 to 50 nanometers in thickness, and only this thin layer separated the remodeled mineralized bone from the implant.

The amounts of collagen grafted were in accordance with the amounts of free epoxy rings detected and correlated with the growth of endothelial cells on the substrates.

The exudate formed inside cylindrical tubes composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), silicone elastomer (SIL), or polyurethane (PU) implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal region of rats was collected over a S-week period. The volume, number of cells, and concentration of fibrinogen were determined in the exudate for the three biomaterials. The exudate was analyzed using a flow cytometry technique after labeling of the leukocytes with a monoclonal anti-CD45 antibody. Fibrinogen rose progressively over the 3-week period for the three polymers. After the different leukocyte lines were identified in rat blood samples, their determination in the exudate revealed differences among the three biomaterials. At day 2, PVC induced a predominantly neutrophilic inflammatory reaction whereas PU and SIL gave a mixture of monocytes and neutrophils. At day 9, the aspect of the cytograms was different, but the identification of the subpopulations was still possible. At day 23, the number of cell events became too low to distinguish the subpopulations. An even more detailed approach might be possible using specific labeling for each leukocyte line to establish a comparison among the three biomaterials.

Development of improved ureteral stent biomaterials capable of preventing or reducing encrustation is therefore particularly desirable. In this study, the suitability as a ureteral stent biomaterial of Aquavene(R), a novel poly(ethylene oxide)/polyurethane composite hydrogel was compared with that of silicone and polyurethane, two materials widely employed in ureteral stent manufacture. Examination of Aquavene(R) in dry and hydrated states by confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy showed the presence of numerous channels within a cellular matrix structure. The channel size increased considerably to as much as 10 mu m in diameter in the hydrated state. Aquavene(R) provided superior resistance to encrustation and intraluminal blockage over a 24-week period in a simulated urine flow model. Unobstructed urine flow continued with Aquavene(R) at 24 weeks, whereas silicone and polyurethane stents became blocked with encrustation at 8 and 10 weeks, respectively. Weight loss within Aquavene(R) on the order of 9% (w/w) over the 24-week flow period indicates that extraction of the noncrosslinked poly(ethylene oxide) hydrogel may be responsible for the prevention of encrustation blockage of this biomaterial. In the dry state, Aquavene(R) was significantly harder than either silicone or polyurethane, as shown by Young's modulus, and rapidly became soft on hydration. These additional properties of Aquavene(R) would facilitate ease of stent insertion in the dry state past obstructions in the ureter and provide improved patient comfort on subsequent biomaterial hydration in situ. Aquavene(R) is a promising candidate for use in the urinary tract, as it is probable that effective longterm urine drainage would be maintained in vivo. Further evaluation of this novel biomaterial is therefore warranted.

The multiphasic material used was composed of a 2% aqueous solution of methylhydroxypropylcellulose (MHPC) and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP, 60% hydroxyapatite and 40% beta-tricalcium phosphate) in which MHPC served as the carrier for 80-200 mu m of BCP granules. The best BCP/polymer ratio was determined by the rheological properties and higher BCP content of the material. Steam sterilization was more effective than gamma irradiation in maintaining the stability of the mixture and conserving its physiochemical and mechanical properties. The in vitro biocompatibility of the composite was checked by direct-contact cytotoxicity and cell-proliferation assays. A preliminary in vivo test was performed in the rabbit using intraosseous implantations in the femoral epiphysis. Histological analysis was done after 1, 2, 4, and 10 weeks. Bone ingrowth into the IBS, in close association with BCP granules, was observed after 1 week and increased regularly from the surface inward at 2, 4, and 10 weeks. At the same time, smaller BCP granules (less than 80 microns in diameter) were degraded and resorbed. This injectable biomaterial proved suitable for cavity filling. The water solubility and viscosity of the polymer allow cells to recolonize, with in situ bonding of the mineral phase.

The results have led to a model of plasminogen interactions with epsilon-amino groups, This paper focuses on the desorption kinetics of plasminogen adsorbed to this material, Plasminogen is shown to bind to the dipeptide in at least four different ways to the epsilon-amino groups. It is suggested that some molecules bind to several epsilon-amino groups at the same time. The surface plasmon resonance analysis also indicates that the interaction of Glu-plasminogen with L-lysine is very complex and may not be defined simply by discrete kringle interactions alone, Dissociation constants ranging from 0.1 s(-1) to less than 5 x 10(-7) s(-1) are observed.

Only Ti-6Al-4V ELI and Ti-6Al-7Nb have been standardized for biomaterials in ASTM among various titanium alloys. Ti-6Al-4V ELI is a representative titanium alloy used as an alternative artificial metallic material for failed hard tissue. The implant materials for alternative use to failed hard tissue are often used under cyclic loading. The principal cause of implant failure is fatigue fracture. The fatigue strength is one of the most important properties for implant materials. There is a possibility for the implant materials to be fractured under monotonic loading conditions during fatigue, consequently the prediction of the fatigue life of the implant materials is important. An evaluation of the fracture characteristics of fatigued implant materials will offer information about the residual fatigue life and the residual fracture resistance of these materials. The relationship between fatigue damage and mechanical properties in Ti-6Al-4V ELI with equiaxed alpha structure were investigated in this study. The tensile strength of fatigued specimens of Ti-6Al-4V ELI with equiaxed alpha structure increases rapidly within the low-cycle-fatigue region. On the other hand, the elongation of fatigued specimens tested at various fatigue increments decreases rapidly within the low-cycle-fatigue region. The energy absorbed by fatigued specimens during various fatigue steps decreases rapidly in the late stages of the low-cycle-fatigue region. Furthermore, a hardness gradient develops initially from the surface to the inside of the specimens, and then in the later stages of fatigue, the internal hardness is equal to the surface hardness. The sub-structures both near and far from the surface of fatigued specimens, observed after various fatigue steps, show an increased dislocation density. However, at the late stages of low-cycle-fatigue, the dislocation density far from the specimen surface, also increases dramatically. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

This putative interaction was examined by quantifying the adhesion of M187 (PS/A+, slime+) parent strain and isogenic transposon mutant strain sn3 (PS/A-, slime-) to polyethylene (PE) under a range of physiologic shear stress conditions in both phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% platelet poor plasma (PPP). No significant differences in adhesion were noted between the M187 and sn3 strains in either test medium. However, adhesion of both strains in 1% PPP was decreased 75-95% compared to adhesion in PBS. In PBS, adhesion was shear stress dependent from 0-15 dyne/cm(2), after which adhesion was comparatively shear stress independent. Adhesion in 1% PPP was independent of shear stress. Epifluorescent imaging of both strains labeled for slime confirmed the presence of slime on the surface of M187 and suggested that PS/A and slime promote the formation of large aggregates, as aggregates were totally absent in the images of the sn3 strain. The results suggest that PS/A and slime do not mediate S. epidermidis adhesion to bare PE or PE with adsorbed plasma proteins, but may be necessary for intercellular adhesion, which is important for biofilm formation.

The technique is based upon the well-known concept of tracking translating laser speckle with a linear array CCD camera, but employs a unique data-processing scheme based upon a two-dimensional frequency transform of the data. The method proved to be successful in evaluating strain rates in the bone samples. Measured strain rates ranged between 4.61 and 23.84 mu epsilon/s. Total strains recorded were between 3.7 and 19.1 mu epsilon. Estimated Young's moduli averaged 9.01 +/- 3.93 GPa, which, considering the extremely slow strain rates, is an acceptable value for porcine cortical bone. General advantages of the technique include high sensitivity, insensitivity to zero-mean noise sources, compact design, and the fact that it is truly noncontact. A brief discussion of possible error sources within the method is also given.

The material most widely used in clinical medicine is hydroxyapatite. The aim of our investigation was to study the effect of hydroxyapatite size mechanism on osteoblasts. The osteoblasts were cultured in vitro with 0.1% (1 mg/mL) of various sized hydroxyapatite particles (0.5-3.0, 37-63, 177-250, and 420-841 mu m) for 1 h, 3 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days. The results showed that adding hydroxyapatite particles to osteoblast culturs can significantly affect osteoblast cell count. Osteoblast populations decreased significantly. Osteoblast mean surface areas also changed significantly. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations in culture medium decreased significantly with the addition of hydroxyapatite particles. Prostaglandin E-2, (PGE(2)) concentrations in medium increased significantly. The changes in TGF-beta 1 and PGE(2), concentration were more significant and persisted longer in smaller-particle groups. The inhibitory effects of hydroxyapatite particles on osteoblast cell cultures were mediated by the increased synthesis of PGE(2). Caution should be exercised before using a hydroxyapatite product which could easily break down into fine particles.

From immunologic studies it is known that inflammatory reactions can be modulated by use of (anti)-growth factors or anti-inflammatory drugs. Before this can be employed with respect to biomaterials, the role of individual factors (humoral and cellular) has to be studied. In this part of the investigation, the role of T cells was studied by use of T-cell-deficient (nude) rats and control (AO) rats. Hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked dermal sheep collagen (HDSC) was selected as the test material. The results showed that T cells or T cell-related factors played a prominent role in the attraction of macrophages and the formation of giant-cells, their antigen presentation, and their phagocytotic capacity. As a consequence, degradation of HDSC was strongly delayed. This study also showed that infiltration of fibroblasts and creation of stromal areas in HDSC was restricted to areas subjected to degradation. However, in time, absence of T cells resulted in increased formation and maturation of autologous rat collagen. Results obtained suggest that the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials might be modulated by controlling T-cell activation.

Human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured on tissue culture grade polystyrene (PS), and two model poly(urethane)s were synthesized from (1) polycaprolactone (PCL) and (2) polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO), both with 2, 4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and ethylene diamine (ED). The increase in CE and total protein per cell were measured on days 8 and 28 in culture and normalized to the DNA content per cell. At day 8 there consistently were fewer cells remaining on the PTMO-based polymer than on the PCL-based polymer or the PS (p < 0.05). When comparing day 28 to day 8, there was more CE activity and protein per cell on all materials. However, there was a disproportionate synthesis of CE per mg of total protein on PS and TDI/PCL/ED whereas on PTMO there was not. Significantly, there was more protein and CE per cell on PTMO than on PS or TDI/PCL/ED (p < 0.05). This in vitro model system of the chronic phase of inflammation has shown that it is possible to culture monocytes for a month and assess the material surface itself as a potent activator of the differentiation into macrophages without secondary stimulation. Since CE has been shown to degrade poly(ether and ester)based poly(urethane)s, the differential production of this enzyme relative to the total protein on different surfaces may impact on the potential long-term biostability of an implanted material.

Of the several possible pathways, this study focuses on the amount of cAMP that accumulated in NIH 3T3 cells during the first 45 min after the cells contacted the bioincompatible membrane Cuprophan (CU) and the biocompatible membrane AN69. The cells that adhered to CU contained more cAMP than those that attached to AN69. This might be because the cells did not spread but remained rounded up under scanning electron microscopy. There was no increase in cAMP in the cells that did not adhere to CU. The cAMP-modulating agents, forskolin and isoproterenol, were used to assess the cAMP-generating capacity of adenylylcyclase in cells adhering to CU and AN69. This capacity was not affected by a high concentration (100 mu M) of forskolin. Isoproterenol had no effect on the cAMP content of the cells, demonstrating that beta adrenergic receptors are not implicated in the activation of cAMP production by membranes. The bioincompatibility of CU seems to he responsible for the greater amount of cAMP in adherent cells, and this parameter could provide an index for assessing biocompatibility.

The integrity of the microfibrillar structure was confirmed by optical and scanning electronic microscopy. The results indicate that the glutaraldehyde acetals procedure may be of potential use for the crosslinking of bovine pericardium used in the manufacture of bioprosthetic devices. Advantages may be related to the production of materials with homogeneous crosslinking distributions, associated with better definition in the nature of the chemical link that they introduce, due to a better distribution of glutaraldehyde within the tissue matrix before the crosslinking reaction is allowed to occur.

Determination of the cell-substrate contact area is necessary in order to understand how biomaterial properties influence cell adhesion. In this review we describe the development and application of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to quantify the separation distance of cells from a biomaterial surface. An approximate theory is presented for the straightforward calculation of separation distances when a fluor is placed in the cell membrane. The validity of this approach is discussed. TIRFM is compared to interference reflection microscopy and related techniques that measure cell/substrate separation distances. This approach is then applied to a number of important problems in cell substrate interactions, including changes in contact area and adhesion strength on biomaterial surfaces, analysis of bond strength, and real-time measurement of cell/substrate separation distances following exposure to flow.

Cells that interact with the implant will be reacting to a layer (single or multiple) of adsorbed protein. The parameters of importance in a study of protein adsorption to surfaces of biomaterial interest include total amounts of different adsorbed proteins and the conformation and orientation of these adsorbed proteins. Researchers have developed a number of techniques with which we can now address all these questions. In this paper, we have discussed how Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) techniques can be used for the study of biomaterial surfaces and events at biomaterial surfaces such as protein adsorption. FTIR spectroscopy offers higher signal-to-noise and speeds than spectrometers that use gratings and hence offers the capability of observing the critical early events when proteins interact with surfaces. Perhaps the biggest advantage of the FTIR technique over dispersive spectrometers is wavelength precision. This allows the subtraction of water, a strong infrared absorber, from the spectra of proteins in aqueous solutions. This review starts with an introduction of how ATR can be used to provide information about proteins on surfaces. Equations to calculate the amount of proteins adsorbed to surfaces from analysis of ATR spectra are presented. A discussion of the kinds of surfaces that can be analyzed by FTIR/ATR and difficulties with the subtraction of H2O is given. The rest of the review deals with how information of interest to biomaterials researchers such as kinetics of protein adsorption, changes in protein secondary structure and orientation upon adsorption to surfaces can be obtained by FTIR/ATR.

The movement of fibrinogen-gold conjugates was observed in real time using video-enhanced interference reflection microscopy (VEIRM) and the redistribution of fluorescein-labelled fibrinogen was examined using video-intensified epifluorescence microscopy (VIFM). Fibrinogen was picked up by spreading platelets and moved rewards the centre of the platelets. The velocity of the movement of fibrinogen-gold conjugates under the ventral membrane ranged from less than 0.1 mu m min(-1) to more than 10 mu m min(-1). The average velocity in the peripheral web region was more than 6 mu m min(-1), and was reduced to around 1 mu m min(-1) in the outer and inner filamentous zones. The centralized fibrinogen molecules were internalized and eventually removed from the platelets.

One interesting feature of the method is the possibility of detailed and accurate determination of real-time adsorption kinetics of proteins without labelling of the protein. It is else possible to detect protein adsorption with the use of antibodies that adsorb onto the antigen-coated surfaces and to detect antibodies by their adsorption behaviour with regard to antigen-coated surfaces. Compared to other solid phase methods such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay, ellipsometry has the advantage of not involving any labelling of the reactant and it is a relatively inexpensive method to maintain. This review is a current report of 15 years of contributions in biomaterials and biochemical research. Special consideration has been given to biologically related surface phenomena such as protein conformation changes, protein displacement effects, early events in blood clotting and complement activation. Among the technical achievements given prominence are the wettability gradient method and the rational use of silicon as an experimental surface. It is clear that ellipsometry and related methods such as reflectometry and surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) are now being increasingly used in biomaterial research as well as in other areas of research.

In this contribution we review briefly applications of infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and ellipsometry as tools for analysis of the chemical properties of model surfaces, and their biological response in vitro when in contact with blood plasma or serum, respectively. The strength of the combination of the techniques is demonstrated by determination of protein adsorption patterns on a series of chemically well-defined so-called self-assembled alkanethiolate monolayers (SAMs) of 16-thiohexadecanol (HS-(CH2)(16)-OH) and n-hexadecanethiol (HS-(CH2)(15)-CH3) on gold.

Until recently, such processes could not be observed directly. Over the past decade, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has provided mechanistic insights into the molecular level interactions that occur at the biomaterial interface. Several unique operational modes have been developed which utilize intermittent contact with the sample and decrease applied shear forces. These dynamic modes also can be used to study the role of different structural components on biomaterial micromechanical properties. Force detection techniques allow molecular level studies of individual receptor-ligand binding events, and force mapping for determining structure/function relationships. Advancements in tip manufacturing, image processing techniques, the use of model surfaces and labeling all have contributed to the advancement of the AFM as a state-of-the-art research instrument.

Among the many surface analytical tools, AES has been shown to be very effective for surface composition analysis. These analyses are critically needed to better understand the interactions between the host and implant. The use of AES for titanium (Ti) and hydroxyapatite (HA) biomaterials characterization is demonstrated in this paper. The relative peak heights of TiL2,3M2,3V can be used as 'fingerprints' for TiO2 surfaces which have undergone different degrees of reduction. Similarly, for HA coatings, a shift in the phosphorus Auger peaks to a higher kinetic energy indicates the presence of a phosphate group, with strong P-O bonds. Depth compositional profiling and thin-film analysis can be performed using AES. In our studies, oxide thicknesses on Ti surfaces range from 36.8 +/- 7.4 Angstrom to 436 +/- 49 Angstrom depending on the surface treatment. Depth profiling can also be used to determine the subsurface composition of biomaterials. For HA coatings, a phosphorus concentration at the oxide/metal interface has been observed to be higher than at the outermost oxide surface. The HA coatings have also been observed to coexist within the titanium oxide, suggesting the occurrence of chemical bonding between the coatings and the metallic substrates. However, like other analytical tools, AES has its limitations. The electron beam damage can severely limit useful analysis of organic and biological materials and occasionally ceramic materials. Carbide buildup during long beam exposure times has been shown to affect the relative peak-to-peak intensities of the oxygen and metal Auger signals. The determination of film thickness requires a standard of known thickness and depth profiling of overlapping peaks can be very problematic. Even with these limitation, AES can be a powerful analytical tool for the characterization of biomaterial surfaces. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The situation of dental biomaterials is considered with special reference to glass-ionomer polyelectrolyte systems and to the impedance changes that may arise in consequence of setting mechanisms. Measurements have been conducted using both static and frequency-dependent potentials; where appropriate, with a high impedance interface and frequency-response analyser. Data are presented for the control situation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and for a series of glass-ionomer and resin-modified glass-ionomer biomaterials. It is observed that in the glass-polyalkenoate (G-PA) materials, ionic conduction and polarization are the dominant factors contributing to the impedance. This contrasts with the dipolar relaxation characteristic of PMMA. It is concluded that a more extended programme of data-acquisition is required, where possible from a 'homologous' series of formulations, to lay a firm foundation of mechanistic interpretation.

The heads were paired with polyethylene (UHMWPE) discs in a ball-on-disc machine. The abrasive wear resistance of the heads increased with surface hardness, and qualitatively differing patterns of wear were observed on the UHMWPE surfaces, depending on the abrasive wear of the matching areas of the heads.

Methods: In each of ten dogs, BP was placed in one lung and ePTFE in the other. The implants were retrieved at 30, 95, or 167 days after implantation and studied histologically. The connective tissue covering the implants was measured and analysis of variance tvas used to compare results with the two materials. Results: At 30 days, the BP specimens showed focal chronic inflammation and thin tissue coverage, whereas the ePTFE specimens had no focal inflammation and thick tissue coverage. At 95 and 167 days, the inflammation in the BP specimens had resolved, but tissue coverage remained minimal, and there was no resorption of the BP. In the ePTFE specimens, tissue coverage had increased. Analysis of variance comparing representative tissue specimens showed that the tissue encapsulating the ePTFE was significantly thicker than that surrounding the BP (P < 0.0001). No air leaks, staple-line disruptions, or infections occurred in the study. Conclusions: Neither ePTFE nor BP is resorbable. Both materials have been used successfully, without resultant infections, for clinical staple-line reinforcement. The more favorable tissue response to ePTFE observed in this study may have clinical ramifications. Comparative clinical studies of the two materials are needed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The biotechnological applications focus on the aspects of cellular growth or delivery of proteins capable of stimulating cellular response. However, basic knowledge about collagen biochemistry and the processing technology in combination with understanding of the physico-chemical properties is necessary for an adequate application of collagen for carrier systems. The purpose of this review article is to summarize information available on collagen dosage forms for drug delivery as well as to impart an overview of the chemical structures and the galenical properties including detailed description of the processing steps - extraction, purification, chemical crosslinking and sterilization. The most successful and stimulating applications are shields in ophthalmology, injectable dispersions for local tumor treatment, sponges carrying antibiotics and minipellets loaded with protein drugs. However, the scientific information about manipulating release properties or mechanistic studies is not as abundant as for some synthetic polymers.

The interactions of osteoblasts with different substrates can be measured in terms of cytotoxicity, attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. The osteoblast culture systems that produce an osteoblast matrix opposing implant material substrates provide one model for evaluating the implant-bone inter face. Alterations in osteoblast behavior at different culture substrates ma) reflect clinical determinants of bone formation at these substrates in vivo; however, cell responses in vitro have not been compared or correlated with in vivo outcomes. Legitimate interpretations of in vitro experiments are discussed in terms of practical, technical, and biologic limitations presented by the cell culture approach. Cell culture provides access to molecular and cellular information that fosters nanostructural engineering approaches to implant design and significant hypotheses to be tested in vivo. In this way, cell culture offers unique insights into the process and phenomenon of osseointegration.","Univ N Carolina, Sch Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Dent Res Ctr,Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Cooper, LF (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Dent Res Ctr,Dept Biochem & Biophys, 302 Brauer Hall,CB 7450, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",,,"Cooper, Lyndon/0000-0002-6577-781X",,,,106,124,130,0,9,QUINTESSENCE PUBL CO INC,CAROL STREAM,"551 NORTH KIMBERLY DR, CAROL STREAM, IL 60188-1881 USA",0882-2786,,,INT J ORAL MAX IMPL,Int.

An indirect central flattening is induced by a peripheral steepening related to the segments. This surgery was recently approved in Europe, but is still under evaluation in the multicenter study controled by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). We took part in that protocol and report our results at one year follow-up. Material and method Twenty-five patients were included in the study with 47 operated eyes and a follow-up between 3 to 18 months. Data relative to refractive results, quality of the vision and anatomic changes induced by intra stromal segments will be collected at the issue of a rigourous survey. Results At one year, non-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 100% and 20/20 in 60%. We noted no loss in best visual acuity and an improvement of one or two lines in 20% of operated eyes. No significative changes were observed concerning : intraocular pressure, corneal sensitivity, central pachymetry or corneal endothelium. Three eyes had to be explanted and recovered the preoperative refraction. No severe complications were observed. Discussion Analysis of results is in favor of the efficacy, predictibility and reproductibility of the surgery, which might be better with rings of a diameter under 0.40 mm. Occurrence of postoperative astigmatism appears to constitue the main limit suggesting discussion on etiologic factors and modalities of treatment. Conclusion This concept of intra-corneal rings appears particularely, promising for correction of low myopia and maybe in the near future for correction of others ametropia, requiring design of new specific segments. Essential interest of this surgery is the respect of rite central area and its potential reversibility.","Hop Morvan, Serv Ophtalmol, F-29609 Brest, France","Colin, J (reprint author), Hop Morvan, Serv Ophtalmol, F-29609 Brest, France.",,,,,,,13,18,18,0,0,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",0181-5512,,,J FR OPHTALMOL,J.

All lenses had 6.0 mm optics and PMMA haptics. A standardized surgical protocol was performed by a single surgeon using an extracapsular technique with capsulorhexis. Patients having surgical complications were excluded, and all patients had standardized medication and follow-up. Posterior capsule opacification was assessed by a digital retroillumination camera using a dedicated software program based on the analysis of texture in the image and calculated as the percentage area of opacified capsule. Data were analyzed 2 years postoperatively. Results: There was a significant difference in percentage of PCO at 2 years among the three lens types (P < .0001). The AcrySof lenses were associated with ess PCO (median 11.75%) than PMMA (43.65%) and silicone (33.50%) lenses (P < .001 and P = .025, respectively). The difference between PMMA and silicone lenses was not statistically significant.

Setting: A British teaching hospital eye department. Methods: Ninety eyes were prospectively randomized to receive a PMMA, silicone, or AcrySof IOL. All lenses had 6.0 mm optics with PMMA haptics. A standardized surgical protocol was performed by a single surgeon using an extracapsular technique with capsulorhexis; eyes that experienced a surgical complication were excluded. All patients had standardized postoperative medication and follow-up. Specular microscopy of the anterior IOL surface was carried out after pupil dilation on days 1, 7, 30, 90, 180, 360, and 720 to assess small cell and giant cell reactions. Results: All three IOL types produced a mild degree of nonspecific foreign-body response, which resolved over the study period without detrimental effect. The silicone group had significantly higher small cell counts than the PMMA and AcrySof groups (P = .02); the AcrySof group had significantly lower giant cell counts than the other two groups (P = .003). Conclusion: The three IOL types were sufficiently biocompatible to function in normal eyes with age-related cataracts. However, AcrySof IOLs were associated with lower giant cell counts than PMMA and silicone IOLs and might produce better results in eyes with pre-existing blood-aqueous barrier damage.","St Thomas Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, London SE1 7EH, England","Spalton, DJ (reprint author), St Thomas Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Lambeth Palace Rd, London SE1 7EH, England.",,,,,,,19,115,129,0,13,AMER SOC CATARACT REFRACTIVE SURGERY,FAIRFAX,"4000 LEGATO RD, SUITE 850, FAIRFAX, VA 22030 USA",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed binding of this protein to the surface of polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and a polyurethane, Chronoflex, after water washing, but only trace levels could be detected on two polymethacrylate derivatives, polymethyl methacrylate and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). alpha-1-m was selectively desorbed from the five materials by sequential washes of serum-conditioned surfaces with isopropanol solutions at increasing concentrations. The presence of alpha-1-m in the washing supernatants was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The relative binding strength of alpha-1-m to each surface was evaluated as the isopropanol (IsoPOH) concentration required to desorb the protein from that surface. Analysis of bound proteins by SDS-PAGE conclusively demonstrated the binding of a range of serum proteins, including alpha-1-m, to all polymer systems, but with varying binding strengths. The majority of protein was removed by water washing for the polymethacrylate polymers, while varying concentrations of IsoPOH were required to desorb proteins from PS, PVC and Chronoflex. There was a correlation between the hydrophobic nature of the material, determined by water contact angle measurements, and adsorption of alpha-1-m. Immunoblotting of isopropanol-eluted proteins by alpha-1-m antibodies showed the positive staining of a 29 kDa protein as well as selected bands within a molecular weight range of 40-200 kDa, suggesting the adsorption of this protein as both free and complexed forms. The ability of alpha-1-m to adsorb on to material surfaces and to participate in events relevant to the biocompatibility of a polymer, such as bacterial infection or inflammation control, suggests the need for further characterization of the properties of this protein.

Unfortunately, biofilm formation on the esophageal side of voice prostheses limits their lifetime to 3-4 mon on average. The effects of repeated argon plasma treatment of medical grade, hydrophobic silicone rubber on in vitro adhesion and growth of bacteria and yeasts isolated from voice prostheses, as well as in vivo biofilm formation are presented here. In vitro experiments demonstrated that initial microbial adhesion over a 4 h time span to plasma-treated, hydrophilized, silicone rubber was generally less than on original, hydrophobic silicone rubber, both in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film on the biomaterial. Growth studies over a time period of 14 d at 37 degrees C in a modified Robbins device, showed that fewer Candida cells adhered on plasma-treated, hydrophilized silicone rubber as compared to on original, hydrophobic silicone rubber. For the in vivo evaluation of biofilm formation on plasma-treated silicone rubber voice prostheses, seven laryngectomized patients received a partly hydrophilized ""Groningen Button"" voice prosthesis for a planned evaluation period of 4 wk. After removal of the voice prostheses, the border between the hydrophilized and the original, hydrophobic side of the prostheses was clearly visible. However, biofilm formation was, unexpectedly, less on the original, hydrophobic sides, although the microbial compositions of the biofilms on both sides were not significantly different. Summarizing, this study demonstrates that in vitro microbial adhesion and growth on silicone rubber can be reduced by plasma treatment, but in vivo biofilm formation on silicone rubber voice prostheses is oppositely enhanced by hydrophilizing the silicone rubber surface. Nevertheless, from the results of this study the important conclusion can be drawn that in vivo biofilm formation on voice prostheses is controlled by the hydrophobicity of the biomaterials surface used.

Biomaterials for implants have to display a wide range adaptability to suit the various stages of the bio-integration process of any foreign material into the human body, Often, a combination of materials is needed. The preparation of a functionally graded bioceramic coating composed of essentially calcium phosphate compounds is explored. The coating is graded in accordance to adhesive strength, bioactivity, and bioresorbability. The bond coat on the Ti-6Al-4V stub is deposited with a particle range of the hydroxyapatite (HA) that will provide a high adhesive strength and bioactivity but have poor bioresorption properties. The top coat, however, is composed of predominantly alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP) that is highly bioresorbable. This arrangement has the propensity of allowing accelerated bio-integration of the coating by the body tissues as the top layer is rapidly resorbed, leaving the more bioactive intermediate layer to facilitate the much needed bioactive properties for proper osteoconduction. The processing steps and problems are highlighted, as well as the results of post-spray heat treatment.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",,,"Khor, Khiam Aik/G-2827-2010; Khor, Khiam Aik (Michael)/B-6929-2009","KHOR, Khiam/0000-0003-1954-8423",,,,33,22,23,0,4,ASM INTERNATIONAL,MATERIALS PARK,"SUBSCRIPTIONS SPECIALIST CUSTOMER SERVICE, MATERIALS PARK, OH 44073-0002 USA",1059-9630,,,J THERM SPRAY TECHN,J.

To quantify the total levels of iron present in this organ, an electrochemical method was chosen based on the application of square wave voltammetry using adsorptive collection of iron-catechol on a mercury film microelectrode (MFM). The optimal working conditions to produce a very stable and reproducible iron peak in the digested kidney samples were found to be pH=7.2 provided by 8.0 mmol/L PIPES buffer, catechol concentration of 3.0x10(4) mol/L, deposition potential -1.80 V and deposition time 20 s. These results were compared with those obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) indicating a good performance of the electrochemical method used. The analytical results show an increase of iron concentration with treatment time, which indicates that this metal ion is partially accumulated in the kidney.

It has formed the basis for the emerging discipline of tissue engineering, which uses principles of molecular developmental biology and morphogenesis gleaned through studies on inductive signals, responding stem cells, and the extracellular matrix to design and construct spare parts that restore function to the human body. Among the many organs in the body, bone has considerable powers for regeneration and is a prototype model for tissue engineering. Implantation of demineralized bone matrix into subcutaneous sites results in local bone induction. This model mimics sequential limb morphogenesis and has permitted the isolation of bone morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), from demineralized adult bone matrix. BMPs initiate, promote, and maintain chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, but are also involved in the morphogenesis of organs other than bone. The symbiosis of the mechanisms underlying bone induction and differentiation is critical for tissue engineering and is governed by both biomechanics (physical forces) and context (microenvironment/extracellular matrix), which can be duplicated by biomimetic biomaterials such as collagens, hydroxyapatite, proteoglycans, and cell adhesion glycoproteins, including fibronectins and laminin.

The need to understand the response of human blood to contact with these artificial surfaces has led to multiple studies on the biocompatibilty of biomaterials. Up to this time, these investigations have predominantly been performed using physical, immunological and biochemical methods. Many of these approaches are useful in investigating the multiple factors involved in blood-biomaterial interactions. However, they always reflect the overall behaviour of whole cellular populations in local or systemic reactions. The application of multiparameter flow cytometry, on the other hand, provides insight into antigenic expression and changes at the single-cell level. Therefore, the technique of flow cytometry represents a new and powerful way of analysing and improving the biocompatibility of these materials in blood-contacting applications in this field.

In water, self association is a powerful organizational force leading to a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network (water structure). Localized perturbations in the chemical potential of water as by, for example, contact with a solid surface, induces compensating changes in water structure that can be sensed tens of nanometers from the point of origin using the surface force apparatus (SFA) and ancillary techniques. These instruments reveal attractive or repulsive forces between opposing surfaces immersed in water, over and above that anticipated by continuum theory (DLVO), that are attributed to a variable density (partial molar volume) of a more-or-less ordered water structure, depending on the water wettability (surface energy) of the water-contacting surfaces. Water structure at surfaces is thus found to be a manifestation of hydrophobicity and, while mechanistic/theoretical interpretation of experimental results remain the subject of some debate in the literature, convergence of experimental observations permit, for the first time, quantitative definition of the relative terms 'hydrophobic' and 'hydrophilic'. In particular, long-range attractive forces are detected only between surfaces exhibiting a water contact angle theta > 65 degrees (herein defined as hydrophobic surfaces with pure water adhesion tension tau degrees = gamma degrees cos theta < 30 dyn/cm where gamma degrees is water interfacial tension = 72.8 dyn/cm). Repulsive forces are detected between surfaces exhibiting theta < 65 degrees (hydrophilic surfaces, tau degrees > 30 dyn/cm). These findings suggest at least two distinct kinds of water structure and reactivity: a relatively less-dense water region against hydrophobic surfaces with an open hydrogen-bonded network and a relatively more-dense water region against hydrophilic surfaces with a collapsed hydrogen-bonded network. Importantly, membrane and SFA studies reveal a discrimination between biologically-important ions that preferentially solubilizes divalent ions in more-dense water regions relative to less-dense water regions in which monovalent ions are enriched. Thus, the compelling conclusion to be drawn from the collective scientific evidence gleaned from over a century of experimental and theoretical investigation is that solvent properties of water within the interphase separating a solid surface from bulk water solution vary with contacting surface chemistry. This interphase can extend tens of nanometers from a water-contacting surface due to a propagation of differences in self association between vicinal water and bulk-phase water. Physicochemical properties of interfacial water profoundly influence the biological response to materials in a surprisingly straightforward manner when key measures of biological activity sensitive to interfacial phenomena are scaled against water adhesion tension tau degrees of contacting surfaces. As examples, hydrophobic surfaces ( tau degrees < 30 dyn/cm) support adsorption of various surfactants and proteins from water because expulsion of solute from solution into the interphase between bulk solid and solution phases is energetically favorable. Adsorption to hydrophobic surfaces is driven by the reduction of interfacial energetics concomitant with replacement of water molecules at the surface by adsorbed solute (surface dehydration). Hydrophilic surfaces ( tau degrees > 30 dyn/cm) do not support adsorption because this mechanism is energetically unfavorable. Protein-adsorbing hydrophobic surfaces an inefficient contact activators of the blood coagulation cascade whereas protein-repellent hydrophilic surfaces are efficient activators of blood coagulation. Mammalian cell attachment is a process distinct from protein adsorption that occurs efficiently to hydrophilic surfaces but inefficiently to hydrophobic surfaces. Thus, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrast in the biological response to materials, often disputed in biomaterials science, is very clear when viewed from the perspective of water structure and reactivity at surfaces, The key measure of water structure and activity important to biomaterial scientists is tau degrees rather than parameters such as Zisman's critical surface tension gamma(c) or 'surface free energy' gamma(s) that are shown not to correlate sensibly with either tau degrees or results from the surface force apparatus.

The specific objective of this study was to investigate osteoblast precursor cell responses to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces of different treatments. Since the nature of bone cell responses in vitro is influenced by the properties of HA ceramics, this study was divided into two components: a chemical and crystallographic characterization of the HA ceramics and an in vitro cell culture study. The sintered HA samples were observed to have the highest crystallite size as compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA samples. No differences in the surface roughness and chemical composition were observed among the sintered, calcined, and as-received KA surfaces. In concurrence with the X-ray diffraction, high resolution XPS resolution of Ca 2p also indicated a higher crystallinity on sintered HA samples as compared to the calcined and as-received PIA samples. As indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, increased cell-surface and matrix-associated protein, and 1,25 (OH2) vitamin D-3-stimulated osteocalcin production, a more differentiated osteoblast-like phenotype was observed on the sintered HA surfaces compared to the as-received HA and calcined HA surfaces.

Incorporation was achieved by functionalizing the amine terminus of the peptide with an acrylate moiety, thereby enabling the adhesion peptide to copolymerize rapidly with the PEG diacrylate upon photoinitiation. PEG diacrylate hydrogels derivitized with RGD peptide at surface concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 pmol/cm(2) were studied in vitro for their ability to promote spreading of human foreskin fibroblasts over 24 h. Hydrogels not derivitized with peptides were poor substrates for adhesion, permitting spreading of only 5% of the seeded cells. When immobilized with no spacer arm, both RGD and RDG (inactive control) supported spreading of similar to 50% and similar to 15% of cells at 1 and 0.1 pmol/cm(2) surface concentrations, respectively; lower concentrations did not promote spreading. When a MW 3400 PEG spacer arm was incorporated between the hydrogel and the peptide linkage, incorporation of 1 pmol/cm(2) RGD promoted 70% spreading whereas RDG at the same concentration did not promote spreading. In addition, when cells were seeded in serum-free medium, only RGD peptides incorporated with a spacer arm were able to promote spreading. Thus peptide incorporated into PEG 8000 diacrylate hydrogels without a spacer arm nonspecifically mediated cell spreading whereas incorporation via a MW 3400 PEG spacer arm was required to permit cell spreading to be specifically mediated.

The observation of contrasting results for one material using the above-mentioned methods raised some concern about the assay system used. With further experimentation, it appeared that a sustained release of volatile substances still present in one extract exerted a toxic effect in neighboring cultures. It is concluded that in the microenvironment of a microplate the distribution of samples cannot be disregarded, as it may be responsible for toxicity cross-contamination, Moreover, the use of more than one single method has to be recommended in cytotoxicity testing, in order to avoid false positive results due to experimental artifacts.

When they are implanted inside a body, metallic biomaterials may corrode and/or wear, releasing metal ions and debris which may have toxic effects on tissues and organs. Since it is important for biomaterials to have no toxicity against a living body, a systematic and quantitative evaluation of the cytotoxicity of metallic elements is required for the development of new metallic biomaterials with superior biocompatibility. In this study, the cytotoxicity of 43 metal salts were evaluated by the colony formation method using two kinds of cultured cells. The effects of the difference in valence numbers of metallic elements in the salts on cytotoxicity were examined. The cytotoxicity of the salts of metallic elements' oxo acids was also investigated. As a result, the intensity of metal salts' cytotoxicity tends to be quite similar between MC3T3-E1 and L929 (the correlation coefficient of metal salts' IC(50)s is 0.82). The intensity of metal salts' cytotoxicity depends on the kinds of metallic elements, their chemical states, and concentrations. The IC50 of the highest toxic salt is 1.36 x 10(-6) mol L-1, which differs four orders of magnitude from the IC50 of the lowest toxic salt.

The necessary anticoagulation may be contraindicated and may even further increase the risk for the patient. This article evaluates the currently applied polymeric materials used in intensive care units (ICU) and gives a possible outlook into future developments. It is emphasized that systematic interdisciplinary research of physicans and biomaterial scientists is essential for the successful development of new polymers with improved biocompatibility. For this purpose a brief overview of analytical techniques for surface characterization is given, and future developments to a fully biocompatible polymer are described.","Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Klinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Klin Anasthesie & Intens Therapie, Dept Anaesthesiol & Intens Care Med, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Inst Polymer Res Dresden, Dresden, Germany","Ragaller, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Klinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Klin Anasthesie & Intens Therapie, Dept Anaesthesiol & Intens Care Med, Fetscherstasse 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",,"Umlauf, Ursula/D-3356-2014; Werner, Carsten/F-8127-2010","Werner, Carsten/0000-0003-0189-3448",,,,69,0,0,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0085-2538,1523-1755,,KIDNEY INT,Kidney Int.,FEB,1998.0,,,,64,,,S84,S90,,,,,,7,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,YV782,WOS:000071862800020,9475497.0,,,,2019-02-25

The aim of the presented study was to analyse, whether the use of biactive materials (in case of prostheses-hydroxylapatit-coating-) provides advantages concerning the quality of anchorage compared to biotolerant or bionert materials. The influence of grade of biocompatibility of materials, the surface structure, the period of investigation and weightbearing on the osseointegration of implants was evaluated in an animal experimental study. New Zealand White rabbits got implanted cylinders in the non weightbearing series and spacers in the weightbearing series in the distal femur. The implant materials were spongy metal, porous coated titanium and hydroxylapatit coated titanium. After the experimantal period of 4, 8 respectively 12 weeks the implant bearing femur underwent histological, morphometrical and scanning electromicroscopical investigation. The amount of osseointegration was determined by using the automatical image analysis. The percentage of new build bone was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and the adhesive power by push out tests. For non weightbearing implants higher adhesive powers were measured compared to hydroxylapatit coated implants while osseointegration was identic. All primary press-fit anchored weightbearing implants showed osseointegration. In hydroxylapatit coated specimen the most intensive osseointegration was found however without influence on the adhesive power. This fact was caused by the delamination of the plasma coating as consequence of the unsufficient attachment of the hydroxylapatit coat to the metal nucleus.","Sana Klin Zollernalb GMBH, D-72461 Albstadt, Germany","Gondolph-Zink, B (reprint author), Sana Klin Zollernalb GMBH, Robert Koch Str 26, D-72461 Albstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,35,12,12,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0085-4530,,,ORTHOPADE,Orthopade,FEB,1998.0,27,2,,,,,96,104,,,,,,9,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,ZB832,WOS:000072512500007,9530666.0,,,,2019-02-25

When appropriate treatments were applied, immunological, inflammatory, bacteriological or virological adverse responses can be prevented. However, these treatments may interact with type I collagen, the major component of the organic bone matrix. Type I collagen can bind osteoblasts via specific cell surface receptors, the integrins. In this work, two different xenogenic biomaterials were studied. Both biomaterials have a bovine bone origin. They displayed similar architectural organization with connected plates and rods and similar surface topography and roughness. They differed by the presence or not of collagen type I. The first one was characterized by preservation of the type I collagen matrix associated with spindle-shaped hydroxyapatite crystals and the sec end was solely composed by heal-modified apatite crystals. Osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2) were cultured on both biomaterials and examined in scanning and transmission electron microscopy after 7 and 14 days. Both biomaterials were cytocompatible as demonstrated by good ultrastructural cell preservation. (1) At the surface of the collagen containing biomaterial, cells were elongated in shape and oriented according to the trabecular architecture and to the superficial collagen network. After 14 days of culture, cells were confluent and the biomaterial surface was hidden by the cell sheet. The beta 1 integrin subunit was detected by immunogold in transmission electron microscopy in close relationship with the superficial collagen fibres of the biomaterial and with the outer cell surface. When cultures were carried out in presence of anti beta 1 integrin subunit, cells were packed and piled up with lack of specific orientation. (2) At the surface of the deproteinized biomaterial, cells were globular without specific disposition and often partially attached to the surface. After 14 days of culture, large areas of the biomaterial surface remained uncovered. Anti beta 1 subunits conjugated with gold particles were detected around the cells but with no specific association with the deproteinized biomaterial. These: results strongly suggest that presence of type I collagen fibres in the matrix of a bone biomaterial is of major interest to determine cell attachment, spreading and orientation via interaction between type I collagen and beta 1 integrin subunit of osteoblasts.","Fac Med, Lab Histol Embryol, LHEA, F-49045 Angers, France","Basle, MF (reprint author), Fac Med, Lab Histol Embryol, LHEA, F-49045 Angers, France.",,,,,,,30,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0085-4530,,,ORTHOPADE,Orthopade,FEB,1998.0,27,2,,,,,136,142,,,,,,7,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,ZB832,WOS:000072512500011,9530670.0,,,,2019-02-25

The results obtained contribute significantly to the understanding of the basic mechanisms of adsorption and surface dynamics of organic molecules. especially of proteins. An example of an area of great importance is biomaterials, where ellipsometry is used as a tool in the process of acquiring knowledge about the biological acceptance of new as well as currently used implant materials. In the area of affinity biosensors, ellipsometry has been suggested as a potential readout principle. Ellipsometry is also a tool in emerging technologies, such as surface molecular engineering with the aim to construct molecular superstructures with predesigned biological functions and to interface biology with electronics. However, in most cases when ellipsometry is applied in biology, it has been used for surface mass determination. The potential in using spectroscopic data for reasoning microstructural and dynamic information has not been exploited fully. From the above perspective, this report reviews the use of spectroscopic ellipsometry for studies in surface biology and highlights the advantages it offers. Two main themes are developed. The first is spectroscopy on monolayers of macromolecules with emphasis on determination of their dielectric functions and microstructure. A specific example discussed is ferritin adsorption on gold. The results, including dynamics of both the surface mass and layer microstructure, indicate an adsorption model based on a two-state adsorption mechanism. The second theme is ellipsometrically based biosensor systems. The discussion covers aspects of what imaging ellipsometry can provide in this content and is exemplified by results from affinity biosensor and gas sensor systems.

The goal of the study was to search for a critical size defect model leading to nonunion. The bone gap was maintained for three months with an internal fixation device involving two plates set in orthogonal planes. Radiological and histological examinations were performed on harvested metatarsal banes. Three months after surgery Group #1 animals showed obvious signs of bone healing without achieving complete union in all cases. Evidence of a healing process was not observed in Group #2 animals, and histological examination confirmed the complete failure of bone repair in the 20 mm gaps. These results are comparable to those of other authors who have concluded that a bone gap corresponding to 1.4 times the diaphyseal diameter overshoots physiological bone healing capacities. This long bone defect model showed good biological properties allowing callus settlement with minimal impairment in Group #1 and permitted weightbearing and unrestricted motion in the animals.

A triphasic composite, fabricated by the heterogeneous sintering of titanium and graphite powders was developed to address the fracture and wear performance of titanium. The composite is designed to smear graphite on both articulating surfaces and hence reduced wear and maintained a low friction tribosystem with fracture properties better than conventional bioceramics. The composite is made up of ductile titanium and a colony of hard, wear resistant titanium carbide produced by the controlled sintering of titanium and graphite particles. Free graphite is present in varying quantities depending upon compaction pressure and initial graphite composition. Initial graphite content composites of 4% and 8% were made with different compaction pressure to give a range of porosities from 10% to 45%. The coefficient of frictional was measured on a pin-on-disc (hardened steel) configuration. Under dry state, the coefficient of friction was observed to reduce with increasing porosity. Graphite smearing and the entrapment of debris by the pores contributed to the reduction of the wear components which in rum reduced the coefficient of friction. Under lubricated conditions, the sintered titanium and its composites were observed to be independent of porosity and pore size. The frictional behaviour of the titanium-8% graphite composites showed first, a titanium carbide dominated-wear stage and the second, a free graphite smearing stage. The results proved the concept that the coefficient of friction of titanium-graphite composites approaches that between graphite-graphite surfaces after the running-in period. This proof of concept is the first realisation of a biomaterial that could reduce the coefficient of friction on both articulating surfaces, a step closer to the development of fracture and wear resistant biomaterials that also protects the other counter surface.

Over time, laboratory wear tests have been developed and used more frequently to support the introduction of new material couples. Historically, these methods have been unreliable, and, despite recent improvements, predicting clinical wear performance is still a challenging task. Orthopaedic wear is a highly multi-factorial process-successful simulation depends on the identification, modeling, and control of many critical factors. Clinical results themselves an highly variable, complicating efforts to establish clinical validation criteria for test methods. It is recommended that improvements be made in identifying the appropriate clinical targets for laboratory tests, and that increased effort be directed toward the optimization and standardization of wear test methods.","Smith & Nephew Inc, Orthopaed Div, Memphis, TN 38116 USA","Sauer, WL (reprint author), Smith & Nephew Inc, Orthopaed Div, 1450 Brooks Rd, Memphis, TN 38116 USA.",,,,,,,167,30,30,0,3,AMER SOCIETY TESTING AND MATERIALS,W CONSHOHOCKEN,"100 BARR HARBOR DRIVE, W CONSHOHOCKEN, PA 19428-2959 USA",0066-0558,,0-8031-2490-2,AM SOC TEST MATER,,,1998.0,1346,,,,,,1,29,,10.1520/STP12827S,,,,29,"Engineering, Biomedical; Orthopedics",Engineering; Orthopedics,BM49Q,WOS:000078897100001,,,,,2019-02-25

Materials and Methods: Cylindrical Class V cavities were prepared in human premolars. In the non-exposure group an attempt was made to prepare the floor of the cavity to +/- 0.5 mm from the pulp. In the exposure group, the pulps were intentionally exposed. After hemostasis, the preparation was etched with 10% phosphoric acid. The teeth were restored with All-Bond 2. Histological evaluation was done at 0-7, 28-35, and >90 days. Results: A typical connective tissue response to injury was observed in the majority of the specimens. Irreversible injury to the odontoblasts closest to the site of cavity preparations resulted in the death of these cells. This was followed by an early neutrophilic response, a subsequent macrophage response and a fibroblastic response that led to the deposition of either reparative dentin or calcific bridge formation by odontoblast-like cells. However, another notable feature was the consistent observation of resin particulates within the dentin-pulp complex. These resin particulates could have been indirectly introduced into the pulp through the pertubation of the junctional complexes or the death of the odontoblasts. They may also enter the pulp directly through a pulpal exposure. In some specimens, the presence of these resin particulates appeared to have triggered a foreign body response, characterized by the presence of a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate as well as the appearance of multinuclear giant cells. The persistence of unresolved chronic inflammation was associated with the lack of calcific bridge formation in these specimens.","Univ Hong Kong, Prince Philip Dent Hosp, Dept Childrens Dent & Orthodont, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Biol & Pathol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Tay, FR (reprint author), Univ Hong Kong, Prince Philip Dent Hosp, Dept Childrens Dent & Orthodont, 34 Hosp Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,76,53,53,0,1,"MOSHER & LINDER, INC",WESTON,"318 INDIAN TRACE SUITE 500, WESTON, FL 33326 USA",0894-8275,,,AM J DENT,Am.

Several biomaterials have been tested as a matrix for the ingrowth of (peri)chondroblasts in experimental animals. In young (growing) rabbits we have developed a process of heterotopic cartilage induction with the use of a demineralized (bovine) bone matrix which is enfolded in a pedicled flap of ear perichondrium for at least three weeks. During this period the demineralized matrix is colonized by macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells which start a process of complete biodegradation of the material. Simultaneously, the collagen matrix is invaded by mesenchymal cells, originating from the perichondrium and differentiating into chondroblasts and Inter, into chondrocytes forming the intel cellular substance. The developing, very young cartilage could be demonstrated as collagen type II, thus, hyaline cartilage. When applied with its adherent perichondrium as a graft it merges easily with the more matured host cartilage and even appears to be capable of further growth. Therefore, it seems suitable for the reconstruction of a cartilaginous defect in growing cartilaginous structures like the nasal septum or the larynx.","Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, NL-3015 GD Rotterdam, Netherlands","Verwoerd-Verhoef, HL (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Dr Molewaterplein 40, NL-3015 GD Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,12,9,11,0,0,OCEAN SIDE PUBLICATIONS INC,PROVIDENCE,"95 PITMAN ST, PROVIDENCE, RI 02906 USA",1050-6586,,,AM J RHINOL,Am.

The common denominator for the three main elements that play a role in the physiopathlology of such infections (bacteria, neutrophils, and different biomaterials) are host proteins deposited over the surface of the devices immediately after their implantation. These proteins modulate that host cells response but can also promote Staphylococcus adhesion to the biomaterial. Neutrophils and other cells such as fibroblasts adhere to several extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, vitronectin, via specific cell surface receptor.

A common feature in their biochemistry is that they accumulate large amounts of disaccharides, the most common of which are sucrose and trehalose. Over the past 20 years, we have provided evidence that these sugars stabilize membranes and proteins in the dry state, most likely by hydrogen bonding to polar residues in the dry macromolecular assemblages. This direct interaction results in maintenance of dry proteins and membranes in a physical state similar to that seen in the presence of excess water. An alternative viewpoint has been proposed, based on the fact that both sucrose and trehalose form glasses in the dry state. It has been suggested that glass formation (vitrification) is in itself sufficient to stabilize dry biomaterials. In this review we present evidence that, although vitrification is indeed required, it is not in itself sufficient. Instead, both direct interaction and vitrification are required. Special properties have often been claimed for trehalose in this regard. In fact, trehalose has been shown by many workers to be remarkably (and sometimes uniquely) effective in stabilizing dry or frozen biomolecules, cells, and tissues. Others have not observed any such special properties. We review evidence here showing that trehalose has a remarkably high glass-transition temperature (T-g). It is not anomalous in this regard because it lies at the end of a continuum of sugars with increasing T-g, However, it is unusual in that addition of small amounts of water does not depress T-g, as in other sugars. Instead, a dihydrate crystal of trehalose forms, thereby shielding the remaining glassy trehalose from effects of the added water. Thus under less than ideal conditions such as high humidity and temperature, trehalose does indeed have special properties, which may explain the stability and longevity of anhydrobiotes that contain it. Further, it makes this sugar useful in stabilization of biomolecules of use in human welfare.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Denver, CO 80262 USA","Crowe, JH (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jhcrowe@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,85,860,896,2,137,ANNUAL REVIEWS INC,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4278,,,ANNU REV PHYSIOL,Annu.

Nitrogen ions of 500 eV/at. were used to bombard the surface of polycarbonate (PC) samples to a fluence of 5x10(16) at/cm(2). Five different environments (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, dry air and vacuum) were used to store the samples for some hours (1 to 24 hours) after the implantation. Aging studies of the contact angle (advancing and receding) have shown that the environment gas influences the long term value of the contact angle and helps to maintain the stability of the treated surfaces with the passage of time. XPS and ToF-SIMS have been used to study the chemical effects of both N-2(+) ion irradiation and storage gas surrounding the samples. The results show faster aging in the case of the samples stored in vacuum, a harmful effect of nitrogen gas on the treatment and the formation of new chemical species for all treatments.","Univ Quebec, INRS Energie & Mat, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S2, Canada","Poirier, A (reprint author), Univ Quebec, INRS Energie & Mat, 1650 Blvd Lionel Boulet, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S2, Canada.",ross@inrs-ener.uquebec.ca,,,,,,11,2,2,0,2,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-409-2,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,1998.0,504,,,,,,425,430,,,,,,6,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Materials Science, Coatings & Films",Materials Science,BM67L,WOS:000079427800064,,,,,2019-02-25

The polyrotaxanes inhibited cytoplasmic calcium increase in platelets, increased plasma membrane fluidity of red blood cell ghosts, and elevated cytoplasmic cyclic-3',5'-AMP levels in platelets. Such cellular response to the polyrotaxanes was observed, which was more than that to constituent molecules. These results suggest that the supramolecular structure of the polyrotaxanes contributes to acceleration of the physicochemical interaction with plasma membrane and intracellular metabolism of platelets.

Regioselective acylation of beta-O-methyl-galactopyranoside in nearly anhydrous pyridine with lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia yields the 6-acryloyl derivative (Compound I). Further lipase-catalysed acylation of the monoacrylate derivative in nearly anhydrous acetone yielded 2,6-diacryloyl-beta-O-methyl galactopyranoside (Compound II) that can act as a cross-linker with a structure similar to that of the sugar-based monomer. The high selectivity of enzyme catalysis yielded apparently highly regular hydrogel networks with swelling ratios at equilibrium ranging from 170 to 1100, elastic moduli ranging from 0.005 to 0.088 MPa and calculated mesh sizes ranging from 1160 to 6600 Angstrom. These values are far higher than conventional uncharged or lightly charged hydrogels at similar elastic moduli. Gel swelling was fast, with 75% of the equilibrium swelling value reached in a fractional time of 0.17. Non-selective chemical acryloylation of beta-O-methyl galactopyranoside followed by polymerization yielded a far lower-swelling hydrogel than that obtained using selective enzyme catalysis. These results indicate that the highly regular polymer structure achieved by regioselective enzyme-catalysed acylation yields relatively strong and highly swellable materials. Sugar-based hydrogels, such as those described herein, may find particular use as biomaterials because of their high water content, homogeneity, stability and expected non-toxicity. A wide range of pore sizes can be attained, suggesting that they may also be especially useful as matrices for enzyme immobilization and controlled delivery of biological macromolecules.

Poly[trimellitylimido-L-tyrosine-co-sebacic acid-co-1,3-bis(carboxyphenoxy)propane] microspheres, with and without entrapped bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, were made using the double emulsion solvent evaporation process. Water penetration and anhydride bond cleavage (polymer degradation) occurred rapidly (<5 days) compared to the time scale of overall microsphere erosion (weeks to months) with most polymer compositions. Subsequent to bond cleavage, the ultimate erosion of the microsphere and release of entrapped BSA was due mainly to the slow dissolution of the individual hydrophobic monomers (TMA-Tyr, SA and CPP) from the microsphere surface. BSA. was released at approximately the same rate as the polymer eroded. Due to the fast degradation of anhydride bonds relative to microsphere erosion, initial polymer molecular weight did not have a significant effect on macromolecule release rates. Instead, monomer solubility correlated well with polymer erosion and BSA release rates. This erosion mechanism leads to predictable drug release rates which may be appropriate for the delivery of many protein therapeutics, including vaccine antigens. The anhydride-imide copolymers were well tolerated in acute toxicity studies in rats and therefore show promise as biomaterials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This work was directed towards the investigation of model systems and clinically-applicable materials which provide both of these surface requirements. Model systems were prepared by chemically grafting end-functionalized star poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to surfaces. The end-grafted polymers provide a means for cell-signaling through coupling of peptides to the free chain ends. Protein adsorption on star vs. linear grafted layers was compared. To further understand these results, neutron reflectivity studies were carried out in situ for solvated PEO surfaces to determine the concentration profiles of the swollen grafted layers. Surprisingly, grafted PEO layers which resist protein adsorption have low concentrations of polymer segments throughout the swollen layer. We find that dense star architectures which might be expected to impart improved protein resistance in fact allow small proteins to adsorb. For clinical materials, a novel approach to the surface modification of poly(lactide) (PLA) has been taken by surface segregating a comb copolymer containing a PLA backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) teeth. The ends of the teeth provide sites for surface tethering of peptide ligands. Comb surfaces without tethered ligands are cell adhesion resistant, indicating strong protein adsorption resistance. By then incorporating an adhesion ligand, modulation of cell morphology on comb surfaces has been demonstrated. Finally, the surface segregation of the comb to the surface of PLA was shown via cell attachment assays and XPS measurements.","MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Mayes, AM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,0,9,9,0,1,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-436-X,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,1998.0,530,,,,,,73,84,,10.1557/PROC-530-73,,,,12,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Materials Science,BL98P,WOS:000077368400012,,,,,2019-02-25

First and foremost, materials themselves tend to be hydrophobic and/or thrombogenic in nature, and face compatibility problems upon implantation. To mediate this problem, researchers have attempted to graft proteins or protein fragments onto biomaterial surfaces to promote endothelial cell attachment and minimize thrombosis. We envisioned a novel approach, based on the capability of biomolecules to self-assemble into well-defined and intricate structures, for creating biomimetic biomaterials that promote cell adhesion and proliferation. One of the most intriguing self-assembly processes is the folding of peptide chains into native protein structures. We have developed a method for building proteinlike structural motifs that incorporate sequences of biological interest. A lipophilic moiety is attached onto an N-alpha-amino group of a peptide chain, resulting in a ""peptide-amphiphile."" The alignment of amphiphilic compounds at the lipid-solvent interface is used to facilitate peptide alignment and structure initiation and propagation, while the lipophilic region adsorbs to hydrophobic surfaces. Peptide-amphiphiles containing potentially triple-helical or alpha-helical structural motifs have been synthesized. The resultant head group structures have been characterized by CD spectroscopy and found to be thermally stable over physiological temperature ranges. Triple-helical peptide-amphiphiles have been applied to studies of surface modification and cell receptor binding. Cell adhesion and spreading was promoted by triple-helical peptide-amphiphiles. Cellular interaction with the type IV collagen sequence alpha 1(IV) 1263-1277 increased signal transduction, with both the time mid level of induction dependent upon triple-helical conformation. Collectively, these results suggest that peptide-amphiphiles may be used to form stable molecular structures on biomaterial surfaces that promote cellular activities and improve biocompatibility.

Cell biologists, engineers, and surgeons now work within a team. Artificial connective, epithelial, or neuronal tissues are being constructed using living cells and different kinds of biomaterials. Numerous companies and laboratories are presenting dynamic developments in this field. Prognoses predict that, at the beginning of the coming century, the industry of tissue engineering will reach the importance of the present genetic technology. An enormous demand for organ and tissue transplants motivates research activities and drives the acquisition of innovative techniques and creative solutions. At the front of this development is the creation of artificial skin for severely burned patients and the generation of artificial cartilage for implantation in articular joint diseases. Future challenges are the construction of liver organoids and the development of an artificial kidney on the basis of cultured cells. In this paper we show strategies, needs, tools, and equipment for tissue engineering. The presupposition for all projects is the induction, development, and maintenance of differentiation within the tissue under in vitro conditions. As experiments in conventional culture dishes continued to fail, new cell and tissue culture methods had to be developed. Tissues are cultured under conditions as close as possible to their natural environment. To optimize adherence or embedding, cells are grown on novel tissue carriers and on individually selected biomatrices or scaffolds. The tissues are subsequently transferred into different types of containers for permanent perfusion with fresh culture medium. This guarantees constant nutrition of the developing tissue and prevents the accumulation of harmful metabolites. An or gano-typical environment for epithelial cells, for example, is obtained in gradient containers, which are permanently superfused at the apical and basal sides with different media. Long term experiments result in cultured tissues in a quality thus far unreached.","Univ Regensburg, Inst Anat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; Humboldt Univ, German Rheumatism Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Dept Med 3, Berlin, Germany","Minuth, WW (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Anat, Univ St 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",will.minuth@vkl.uni-regensburg.de,,,,,,102,127,136,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0302-766X,1432-0878,,CELL TISSUE RES,Cell Tissue Res.,JAN,1998.0,291,1,,,,,1,11,,,,,,11,Cell Biology,Cell Biology,YN154,WOS:000071138500001,9394038.0,,,,2019-02-25

Generally, interactions between proteins and polysaccharides in aqueous media can lead to one- or two-phase systems, the latter being generally observed. In some cases of protein-polysaccharide net attraction, mainly mediated through electrostatic interactions, complex coacervation or associative phase separation occurs, giving rise to the formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes. Physicochemical factors such as pH, ionic strength, ratio of protein to polysaccharide, polysaccharide and protein charge, and molecular weight affect the formation and stability of such complexes. Additionally, the temperature and mechanical factors (pressure, shearing rate, and time) have an influence on phase separation and time stability of the system. The protein-polysacchaide complexes exhibit better functional properties than that of the proteins and polysaccharides alone. This improvement could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of the two biopolymers, as well as the structure of the complexes. Consequently, the interesting hydration (solubility, viscosity), structuration (aggregation, gelation) and surface (foaming, emulsifying) properties of these complexes can be used in a number of domains. Among others, these could be macromolecular purification, microencapsulation, food formulation (fat replacers, texturing agents), and synthesis of biomaterials (edible films, artificial grafts).","Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Ecole Natl Agron & Ind Alimentairs, Lab Physicochim & Genie Alimentaires, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Sanchez, C (reprint author), Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Ecole Natl Agron & Ind Alimentairs, Lab Physicochim & Genie Alimentaires, 2 Ave Foret Haye,BP 172, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",,,,,,,243,511,529,23,371,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1040-8398,1549-7852,,CRIT REV FOOD SCI,Crit.

In this paper, we compare the relative performance of these three ionization methods for characterizing the molecular weights, polydispersities and quantification of relative amounts of polymer components in mixtures, Two polymers used in biomaterials, poly(dimethylsiloxane) and poly(ethylene glycol), are employed as the model polymer systems for our survey because of their well defined molecular weights and importance as surfactants in biomaterials and because many of their surface and solution-phase properties are well understood. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization can be used to examine the surface and bulk composition of biomaterials, whereas secondary ion mass spectrometry is used for examining monolayer and submonolayer coverage of polymers on surfaces and electrospray ionization is suited for examination of extractables from biomaterials, Secondary ion mass spectrometry and electrospray show discriminate behavior against ionization of higher molecular weight oligomers, especially of poly(dimethylsiloxane). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization appears to exhibit the best performance for reliable molecular weight determination at higher masses and polydispersity characterization as well as for quantification of components in polymer mixtures. The results are discussed within the context of the ionization mechanisms by which each soft ionization technique operates and by the attributes of the mass analyzers (time-of-flight and Fourier transform mass spectrometers) employed.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Chem, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; Bausch & Lomb Inc, Rochester, NY 14692 USA; Roswell Pk Canc Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Biophys, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA","Yan, WY (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Chem, Nat Sci Complex, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,,"Wood, Troy/0000-0002-2556-8511",,,,25,22,22,0,14,IM PUBLICATIONS,W SUSSEX,"6 CHARLTON MILL, CHARLTON, CHICHESTER,, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO18 0HY",1356-1049,,,EUR MASS SPECTROM,Eur.

Collagenous biomaterials can be stabilized by chemical and physical agents. The epithelium of enucleated porcine eyes was removed. Eight test groups, 10 eyes each, were treated with UV-light (lambda = 254 nm), 0.5% riboflavin, 0.5% riboflavin and W-light (365 nm) blue light (436 nm) and sunlight, and the chemical agents-glutaraldehyde (1% and 0.1%, 10 min) and Karnovsky's solution (0.1%, 10 min). Strips of 5 mm in width and 9 mm in length were cut from each cornea and the stress-strain behaviour of the strips was measured to assess the cross-linking process. For comparison, ten untreated corneas were measured by the same method. Compared to untreated corneas treatment with riboflavin and UV-irradiation as well as weak glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky's solutions resulted in an increased stiffness of the cornea. The biomechanical behaviour of the cornea can be altered by glutaraldehyde, Karnovsky's solution, and with riboflavin and UV-irradiation which offers the potential of a conservative treatment of keratoconus. To optimize this effect further investigation is necessary regarding the dose-response and in-vivo application.

Human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured with ascorbic acid produced a cohesive cellular sheet. This sheet was placed around a tubular support to produce the media of the vessel. A similar sheet of human fibroblasts was wrapped around the media to provide the adventitia. After maturation, the tubular support was removed and endothelial cells were seeded in the lumen. This TEBV featured a well-defined, three-layered organization and numerous extracellular matrix proteins, including elastin. In this environment, SMC reexpressed desmin, a differentiation marker known to be lost under standard culture conditions. The endothelium expressed von Willebrand factor, incorporated acetylated LDL, produced PGI(2), and strongly inhibited platelet adhesion in vitro. The complete vessel had a burst strength over 2000 mmHg. This is the first completely biological TEBV to display a burst strength comparable to that of human vessels. Short-term grafting experiment in a canine model demonstrated good handling and suturability characteristics. Taken together, these results suggest that this novel technique can produce completely biological vessels fulfilling the fundamental requirements for grafting: high burst strength, positive surgical handling, and a functional endothelium.","Hop St Sacrement, Lab Angiogenese Expt LOEX, Ste Foy, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada; Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada","Auger, FA (reprint author), Hop St Sacrement, Lab Angiogenese Expt LOEX, 1050 Chemin, Ste Foy, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada.",nheureux@bioeng.ucsd.edu; lucie.germain@chg.ulaval.ca,,,,,,67,879,892,9,196,FEDERATION AMER SOC EXP BIOL,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3998 USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,JAN,1998.0,12,1,,,,,47,56,,,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,YR723,WOS:000071523800006,9438410.0,,,,2019-02-25

For TP35H and SUS329J4L, the crack growth characteristics in Ringer's solution were almost the same as those in room air in the entire Delta K region examined, and thus the effect of Ringer's solution was not observed. The crack growth rates of SUS304 were enhanced in Ringer's solution in the region of Delta K greater than or equal to 25 MPa root m as compared ro room air, while below this Delta K level they were similar in both environments. Also in Ti-6Al-4V, similar crack growth behaviour in Ringer's solution was found. From the comparison among the da/dN-Delta K relationships of the four materials in Ringer's solution, TP35H exhibited the fastest growth rates and then Ti-6Al-4V, SUS304, SUS329J4L in the order of decreasing growth rate. On the contrary, if the data were plotted in terms of Delta K-eff/E, Ti-6Al-4V and TP35H showed superior crack growth resistance to the stainless steels.","Toyota Coll Technol, Dept Engn Mech, Toyota, Japan; Toyohashi Univ Technol, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan; Gifu Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Gifu, Japan","Nakajima, M (reprint author), Toyota Coll Technol, Dept Engn Mech, 2-1 Eisei Cho, Toyota, Japan.",,,,,,,21,12,12,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",8756-758X,,,FATIGUE FRACT ENG M,Fatigue Fract.

The simulator was also used to evaluate the wear and damage of various material combinations, the effect of conformity, lubricant type, and material integrity. The level of sophistication relating to each type of simulation device is reflected in the development costs of each simulator. For merely material ranking tests the simple pin-on-disc machines represent a quick and low cost estimate of relative material performance. However, for a more accurate representation of the in vivo performance of prosthetic knee replacements it is necessary to replicate the complex kinematics by means of electro-hydraulic or electro-pneumatic simulators with superimposed variable loading patterns. The simulation device detailed in this paper offers some level of performance prediction with respect to the material combinations used for total knee replacements and the laboratory simulation results compare favourably with clinical retrievals. The paper concludes that true simulation is difficult because of the complexity of the systems involved. However, comparative results for both different designs and different biomaterials can be reasonably estimated if there is a goad analogue of both the duty cycle and the predominant in vitro conditions. From the work carried out it appears that important factors for this type of simulation are the integrity of the UHMWPE, lubricant type, surface conformity, and the inclusion of superimposed twisting.","Kingston Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Surrey, England","Lilley, PA (reprint author), Kingston Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,INST ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS INSPEC INC,EDISON,"379 THORNALL ST, EDISON, NJ 08837 USA",0537-9989,,0-85296-709-8,IEE CONF PUBL,,,1998.0,,457,,,,,35,41,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Transportation",Engineering; Transportation,BM06G,WOS:000077496200006,,,,,2019-02-25

Specifically, we will concentrate on the methodology developed by van Oss, Chaudhury and Good [5-7] for the determination of the work of adhesion and interfacial tension. Recently, Good [4] has redefined the surface interaction components gamma(+) and gamma(-) as hydrogen bond acidic and basic parameters. We have related the surface-hydrogen-bond components gamma(+) and gamma(-) to the Taft and Kamlet's [28,29] linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) solvatochromic alpha and beta parameters. We [28,29] have found that, for water at ambient temperature, alpha hydrogen-bond-donating (HBD) ability] and beta[ [hydrogen-bond-accepting (HBA) ability] are not equal, and the ratio for the normalized alpha and beta is 1.8. This new ratio is assumed to be equal to that of gamma(+) & gamma(-) for water at 20 degrees C. On the basis of the new ratio, we will present our recalculated surface-hydrogen-bond components for several polymers and biomaterials. This change in the ratio did not affect the total surface tension or the sign of the interfacial tension. The net improvement is in the lowering of the gamma(-) values. These data may be useful for predicting the adhesion between an adhesive and an adherend.","Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Lee, LH (reprint author), 796 John Glenn Blvd, Webster, NY 14580 USA.",,,,,,,45,17,17,0,7,GORDON BREACH SCI PUBL LTD,READING,"C/O STBS LTD, PO BOX 90, READING RG1 8JL, BERKS, ENGLAND",0021-8464,,,J ADHESION,J.

The chain extender was synthesized by a diesterification reaction between L-phenylalanine and 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol to yield a diester, diamine. Soft segment chemistry (polycaprolactone diol, PCL and polyethylene oxide, PEO) and molecular weight were varied and the impact on polyurethane physicochemical and degradation characteristics was evaluated. It was found that the PEO containing polyurethanes absorbed large amounts of water while the PCL containing ones did not, indicating a large difference in bulk hydrophilicity. The rate of water vapor permeance (WVP) through the polyurethane films generally followed the water absorption trends. However, soft segment crystallinity, noted by DSC, for the PCL containing polyurethanes served to reduce WVP values with increasing PCL molecular weight. Polyurethane surface characterization was carried out by water contact angles and XPS. The PEO containing polyurethanes exhibited low contact angles in comparison with the PCL ones. In addition, angle-resolved XPS demonstrated soft segment surface enrichment in all cases typical for phase segregated materials. Significant variation in the physicochemical properties of the experimental polyurethanes was observed indicating potential use in a variety of biomaterials applications. An in vitro degradation study was carried out by incubating the polymers in 0.1 M TBS at 37 degrees C, pH 8.0 for up to 56 days. Degradation was followed by measuring mass loss, change in molecular weight by GPC and surface alteration by scanning electron microscopy. The polyurethane containing PEO was found to exhibit substantial mass and molecular weight loss over 56 days resulting in a porous material of little strength. In contrast, the PCL containing polyurethane displayed modest mass and molecular weight loss after 56 days. This polyurethane retained its strength and displayed little surface alteration after 56 days in buffer. It was hypothesized that differences in polyurethane hydrophilicity as well as initial molecular weight may have been responsible for the dramatic difference in degradation rate observed here.","Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada","Woodhouse, KA (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, 200 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada.",,,,,,,39,124,126,6,53,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) showed defluorination, oxygen incorporation, and extensive unsaturation within the treated PTFE surfaces. The suitability of these reduced PTFE films as substrates for graft polymerization was initially assessed via photograft polymerization of the sodium salt of styrenesulfonic acid (SS-Na), which permitted unequivocal surface analysis by the introduction of a new atom, as well as poly(ethylene glycol) monoacrylate (PEG-Ac). All photograft polymerization was performed employing ultraviolet irradiation with 2,2 -dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as an initiator. Photograft polymerization of SS-Na was verified by further reduction of fluorine atomic content and the appearance of new sulfur and sodium atomic peaks on ESCA survey spectra, and that of PEG-Ac was verified by further reduction of fluorine atomic content and increase of atomic percent ratio of O/C from ESCA survey spectra as well as appearance of a new ester peak on high resolution ESCA C 1s spectra. Dynamic water contact angles on reduced and PEG-Ac photograft polymerized films were measured and showed that the PTFE film surface became more hydrophilic after reduction (from 120 to 89 deg) and the reduced film became more hydrophilic after photograft polymerization with PEG-Ac (from 89 to 36 deg). Modification of the complete surface of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), i.e, of the lumenal, outside and pore surfaces, was performed by employing the reaction described above, except at 105 degrees C for 1 day, followed by photograft polymerization of PEG-Ac. ESCA was performed on the superficial surfaces (i.e. the lumen and exterior) as well as on cross-sections of the ePTFE to permit analysis of the pore surfaces. This analysis showed that both the initial surface reduction and the subsequent photograft polymerization were successful as indicated from F/C and O/C atomic percent ratios from ESCA survey spectra, from overall peak shapes of high resolution ESCA C Is spectra and from generation of new ester peaks on high resolution ESCA C Is spectra of ePTFE graft polymerized with PEG-Ac, which demonstrated an O/C atomic percent ratio close to that of PEG-Ac homopolymer. Low voltage scanning electron microscopy confirmed minimal morphological damage to the ePTFE microstructure after reduction and graft polymerization. The approach explored thus provides a means for modulation of biological interactions at ePTFE surfaces with only minimal modification of material morphology, with some surface texture appearing on a length scale of 50-100 nm.","Univ Texas, Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Ctr Biomed, Farmington, CT 06030 USA","Hubbell, JA (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, Moussonstr 18, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland.",hubbell@biomed.mat.ethz.ch,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",NIGMS NIH HHS [R43 GM064291]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR-570]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R29 HL055450],,,39,21,21,0,8,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Poly(AM-co-VA) film was synthesized by Hofmann degradation of a cross-linked poly(acrylamide) film. Conversion to vinyl amine on the surface of the film was approximately 50%, but bulk conversion was not observed; surface specificity was thought to be the result of cleavage of aminated polymer chains at the surface due to chain scission. Reaction between primary amine and TPEG gave a graft yield of 2 mol% (based on XPS) with respect to available surface amine groups, equivalent to 54 mol% ethylene oxide based on monomer units. Physical adsorption of non-activated polymer was done under identical conditions as a control and the difference in oxygen content was significant compared to TPEG. The type of buffer agent and buffer concentration did not influence graft yields. This graft reaction, which was completed in as little as 2 h was considered to be mild enough to be used for a surface modification of microcapsules containing cells without affecting their viability. Such a surface modification technique may prove to be a useful means of enhancing the biocompatibility of microcapsules (or any tissue engineering construct) even after cell encapsulation or seeding.","Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada; Univ Toronto, Ctr Biomat, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada","Sefton, MV (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada.",,,,,,,22,2,3,0,14,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Analysis by ATR-FTIR and ESCA reveled that PEG was incorporated well within the GL9-PEG polymer networks and was enriched at the surfaces. From the results of SEM, AFM, and contact angle analyses, GL9-PEG networks showed relatively rough and irregular surfaces compared to GL9 network, but the mobile PEG chains coupled at their termini were readily exposed toward the aqueous environment when contacting water such that the surfaces became smoother and more hydrophilic. This reorientation and increase in hydrophilicity were more extensive with increasing PEG molecular weight and content. As compared to GL9 network lacking PEG, protein adsorption as well as platelet and S, epidermidis adhesion to GL9-PEG networks were significantly reduced as the molecular weight and content of PEG was increased, indicating that GL9-PEG networks are more biocompatible than the GL9 network due to PEG's passivity. Based on the physical and biological characterization reported, the GL9-PEG materials would appear to be interesting candidates as matrices for tissue engineering.","Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Biomat Res Ctr, Seoul 130650, South Korea; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland","Kim, YH (reprint author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Biomat Res Ctr, POB 131, Seoul 130650, South Korea.",yhakim@kistmail.kist.re.kr,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456; Han, Dong Keun/0000-0003-4641-7883",,,,30,53,55,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

To determine the utility of elastomeric materials as substrates for such applications, we asked whether skeletal myogenesis would be supported on a commercially available polyurethane, Tecoflex(R) SG-80A. G8 skeletal myoblasts were cultured on Tecoflex(R) two-dimensional solid thin films fabricated by a spin-casting method. Myoblasts attached, proliferated, displayed migratory activity and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes which expressed myosin heavy chain on solid thin films indicating that Tecoflex(R) SG-80A was permissive for skeletal myogenesis. Porous three-dimensional (3-D) cell scaffolds were fabricated in a variety of shapes, thicknesses, and porosities by an immersion precipitation method, and where subsequently characterized with microscopic and mechanical methods. Mechanical analysis revealed that the constructs were elastomeric, recovering their original length following 100% elongation. The 3-D substrates were seeded with muscle precursors to determine if muscle differentiation could be obtained within the porous network of the fabricated constructs. Following several weeks in culture, histological studies revealed the presence of multinucleated myotubes within the elastomeric material. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the myotubes expressed the myosin heavy chain protein suggesting that the myotubes had reached a state of terminal differentiation. Together the results of the study suggest that it is indeed feasible to engineer bioartificial systems consisting of skeletal muscle cultivated on a 3-D elastomeric substrate.","Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Tissue Engn Lab, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Tresco, PA (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Tissue Engn Lab, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",PatrickTresco@m.cc.utah.edu,,,,,,35,45,45,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

All six polymers, prepared using recombinant DNA technology, expressed at good levels using transformed E. coli fermentation. These E. coli-produced polymers were purified For the first time to the exacting levels required for use as biomaterials where a large quantity could disperse into the tissues in a few days. Time periods of 2 and 4 weeks were used, Polymer I functioned as a bulking agent around which a fine fibrous capsule formed. Inclusion of (GVGVAP)(8), a chemoattractant toward monocytes and elastin-synthesizing fibroblasts in the sequence of polymer I, resulted in an appropriate tissue response of invasion of macrophages. Inclusion of lysine residues, for lysyl oxidase cross-linking, suggested a possible remodeling of the implant toward fibers. Most promising however, when the cell attachment sequence, GRGDSP, was added to polymer I, the implant elicited tissue generation with a normal complement of collagen and elastic fibers, spindle-shaped histiocytes and angiogenesis, If this response is retained over time, the desired soft tissue augmentation and generation will have been achieved, Our working hypothesis is that on formation of elastin, with a half-life of the order of 70 years, a long lasting soft tissue augmentation would result rather than scar tissue as occurs with Contigen(R), the currently approved injectable implant for soft tissue augmentation.","Bioelast Res Ltd, OADI Technol Ctr, Birmingham, AL 35211 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Biol Proc Technol Inst, Gortner Labs 240, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Urry, DW (reprint author), Bioelast Res Ltd, OADI Technol Ctr, 2800 Milan Court,Suite 386, Birmingham, AL 35211 USA.",,,,NICHD NIH HHS [1 R43 HD34659-01],,,58,109,110,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In previous work showing that fibrinogen adsorbed to surfaces quickly becomes non-displaceable upon exposure to blood plasma, the fibrinogen was adsorbed from buffer, so we performed new studies in which the displaceability of fibrinogen adsorbed from plasma was characterized. Fibrinogen was adsorbed from 1% plasma to seven different surfaces for 1-64 min and then transferred to 100% plasma lacking radiolabeled fibrinogen and the amount adsorbed before and after transfer measured. The surfaces were glass, Silicone rubber, and five different polyurethanes. As adsorption time increased, the fibrinogen became increasingly resistant to displacement during the 100% plasma step, but the rate of increase in resistance varied greatly with surface type. Fibrinogen adsorbed from 1% plasma evidently undergoes rapid, surface dependent transitions. This work shows that the transitions that occur when the fibrinogen is adsorbed from blood plasma are similar to what we have previously observed for fibrinogen adsorbed from buffer.","Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Horbett, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL19419, HL25951]",,,29,18,18,0,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Preseeding synthetic graft materials such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with endothelial cells (EC) has been examined in various in vitro and in vivo models. Although various studies provide encouraging results, clinical trials for EC seeding on synthetic grafts have not been equally successful. This paper provides a brief review of the various reports on EC seeding in animal and clinical studies. We discuss the inefficiencies associated with the EC seeding process and examine plasma protein treatment of the graft surfaces as a viable option for improving EC attachment, retention and spreading. As an alternative to exsisting therapies we present data on a heterogeneous ligand treatment of fibronectin (Fn) and avidin-biotin for enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion to ePTFE graft surfaces. Control consisted of HUVECs seeded on Fn treated ePTFE graft surfaces. Functionality of HUVECs was assessed by measuring prostacyclin production of cells on both homogeneous and heterogeneous ligand treated surfaces. Laminar flow studies with a variable width flow chamber and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure initial cell retention and observe initial cell spreading on ePTFE surfaces, respectively. HUVEC retention on heterogeneous ligand treated graft surface was significantly (p < 0.001) higher compared to homogeneous ligand treated surfaces for shear stress in the range of 10-30 dyn cm(-2) HUVEC showed more cellular spreading on the heterogeneous ligand treated surface after seeding for 1-2 h. In vivo experimentation was performed in immune deficient (nude) rats by replacing a section of both the femoral arteries with 8 mm long, 1 mm internal diameter denucleated ePTFE grafts treated with homogeneous and heterogeneous ligands respectively Both grafts were seeded with similar cell density for 15 min prior to implantation. EC attachment and retention was measured by staining EC with hematoxylin and counting the cells before and after flow using light microscopy. The results indicate that a heterogeneous ligand treatment of graft surfaces using avidin-biotin and Fn-integrin attachment mechanisms increase cell seeding efficiency, initial cell retention and cellular spreading.","Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Ctr Cellular & Biosurface Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Reichert, WM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,"Truskey, George/B-2215-2012","Truskey, George/0000-0002-6885-4489","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-44972, HL-32132]",,,89,56,57,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The nature of the Mab dictated the nature of the response: anti-albumin antibodies were used to prevent cell and platelet adhesion in vitro, whilst anti-fibronectin Mabs promoted attachment. Patterned surfaces could be formed, bearing Mabs that generated adhesive and non-adhesive regions. Fibrinogen adsorption from plasma showed a Vroman peak on unmodified control polymer, which was reduced by 64% in the presence of surface-bound anti-albumin Mab. Immobilization of a control Mab reduced fibrinogen adsorption only slightly, implying an albumin-mediated effect. In static tests, platelet adhesion from human platelet rich plasma was significantly reduced by the immobilization of anti-HSA Mab when compared to the untreated FEP surface (p < 0.0001). This effect was also seen with citrated blood flowing through Mab-treated polyurethane tubing at a shear rate of 132 s(-1) (p = 0.034).

However, the mechanism by which adsorbed fibrinogen affects phagocyte responses is still not clear. To investigate the molecular interaction between fibrinogen and biomaterials, fibrinogen fragments (D100 and E50) were generated and used in the present study. The results indicate that biomaterial:D100 interaction is essential to fibrinogen-mediated inflammatory responses, because biomaterials precoated with D100, but not E50, prompt strong inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the results from in vitro studies show that whole molecule fibrinogen and D100 exhibit very similar protein:surface interactions. Specifically: (1) both D100 and fibrinogen have high affinity for biomaterial surfaces; and (2) the retention rates of adsorbed D100 in both in vivo and in vitro environments are as high as that for adsorbed fibrinogen. On the other hand, E50 does bind to biomaterials but with low affinity because, once bound, it is not tightly adherent to the biomaterial surfaces. Taken together, the results suggest that the mechanism of fibrinogen mediated inflammatory responses may involve the following three consecutive events: (1) after contact with blood or tissue fluid, the D domain tends to interact with biomaterial surfaces and is important in the tight binding of fibrinogen to implant surfaces; (2) the biomaterial surface then promotes conformational changes within the D domain, exposing P1 epitope (gamma 190-202, which interacts with phaocyte Mac-1 integrin); and (3) the engagement of Mac-1 integrin with P1 epitope then triggers subsequent phagocyte adherence and reactions.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tang, LP (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",,,,,,,34,37,38,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Activated products of the coagulation cascade may then enhance the inflammatory responses associated with wound healing. In the present investigation the ability of rat osteosarcoma. (ROS) cells to express TF activity was examined following their growth on tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) and selected orthopedic biomaterials (titanium and zirconium alloys, and stainless steel). ROS cells exhibited significant TF activity as evidenced by the conversion of Factor X to Factor Xa in the presence of TF Factor VIIa, and Ca2+. Factor Xa concentrations ranged from 1.0 fM per cell at 10 min to 6.0 fM pel cell after 60 min. Additionally, ROS cells stimulated with calcium ionophore (A13187) exhibited approximately twice the activity of non-stimulated cells when grown on TCPS but not on the metallic substrates. ROS cells (stimulated or unstimulated) adherent to the zirconium alloy generated lower amounts of Factor Xa compared to those bound to the other alloys and unstimulated cells grown on TCPS, These results indicate that ROS cells cultured on these synthetic surfaces differentially express procoagulant activity and that cells grown on TCPS, but not the metallic alloys, exhibit increased TF activity in response to stimulation by calcium ionophore. This procoagulant activity may potentiate subsequent inflammatory responses associated with the use of orthopedic biomaterials and thereby influence the tissue compatibility of the implant.","Memphis State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Slack, SM (reprint author), Memphis State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Campus Box 526582, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",,,,,,,9,6,6,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The nature of the materials may affect the attachment and/or the activation of these cells procoagulant responses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to measure the strength of adhesion of these vascular cells to potential biomaterials (titanium, zirconium alloys, and stainless steel) by exposing them to a range of shear stresses (50-300 dyn cm(-2)) in a parallel plate flow chamber. The procoagulant responses of the cells a ere evaluated by measuring the tissue factor (TF) activity promoted by the different materials under flow conditions. The materials supported distinctly different levels of initial cell adhesion in static culture. However, the fraction of adherent cells did not decline significantly with incrementally increasing shear stress within the range tested. TF expression, as measured by factor Xa (FXa) production, was material-dependent. For example, cells cultured on Ti1313 exhibited more FXa production (13.2 nhl 10(-5) cells) than Ti1313(DH) (8.5 nM 10(-5) cells) or stainless steel (2 nM 10(-5) cells). Thus, our studies indicate that the level of adhesion, strength of attachment and the expression of procoagulant activity of adherent vascular cells depend strongly on the nature of the underlying biomaterial.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Hall, CL (reprint author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biomed Engn, Campus Box 526582, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",clhall@memphis.edu,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL 29019],,,34,11,11,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The first and least understood step in biomaterial-associated infections is the initial interaction between bacteria and a surface. This initial interaction can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the physiochemical nature of the biological and synthetic surfaces, as well as the properties of the interstitial fluid. We have shown that atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be employed as an exquisitely sensitive and versatile tool for quantifying the interaction between bacteria and surfaces in physiological solutions. The forces of interaction between an AFM cantilever tip and a uniform lawn of bacteria immobilized on glass were determined. By comparing the interactions of cantilever tips with lawns of isogenic E. coli strains carrying genetic lesions that alter their cell surface composition, it was possible to evaluate the effect of macromolecules such as lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide on the adhesion process. Mutations that result in the synthesis of truncated lipopolysaccharide or in the overproduction of the negatively charged capsular polysaccharide colanic acid render the interaction of the bacteria. with the AFM tip unfavorable due to increased electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, AFM could be used to evaluate the adhesion of bacteria. onto commercially relevant biomaterials. In one approach, micron-size polystyrene beads were attached to AFM tips which Mere then used to measure forces. Unfortunately, this approach is limited by the meager number of materials manufactured as bead, of a size suitable for AFM measurements. As an alternative approach, AFM cantilever tips were coated with a confluent layer of bacteria and used to probe planar surfaces. In this configuration, AFM could be employed to measure the force of interaction between virtually any bacterium and surface of interest.","Univ Texas, Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Petr Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Georgiou, G (reprint author), Univ Texas, Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,37,54,55,1,21,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The polymers are methoxypolyoxyethylene amine (PEGA1) and polyoxyethylene bis(amine) (PEGA2), which contain charged amine groups at one or both ends, respectively, with PEG as the backbone. The coating of the microcapsules with PEG-amine resulted in a much smoother capsule surface than A-P-A microcapsule surfaces as examined under a scanning electron microscope. The diffusivity of bovine serum albumin into the microcapsules remained the same after PEGA1 coating. But the diffusivity decreased to less than one-fifth that in A-P-A microcapsules coated with PEGA2. The biocompatibility of the microcapsules also improved as investigated by an in vivo study. Microcapsules were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice and retrieved 120 d after implantation. The fibrotic action against A-P-A microcapsules was severe and the capsules retrieved by peritoneal lavage aggregated into clusters. In contrast, the surface-modified capsules were free-flowing and free of cell overgrowth. Secretion of insulin from rat islets within A-P-A-PEGA microcapsules responded well to changes in glucose concentration in a static glucose test. Intraperitoneal transplantation of the microencapsulated islets into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice could maintain normal blood glucose levels in test animals for up to 200 d without immunosuppression.","Chang Gung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan; Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan","Chen, JP (reprint author), Chang Gung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kwei Sun, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan.",,,"Chen, Jyh-Ping/0000-0001-6527-4801; Fu, Shin-Huei/0000-0001-9697-6814",,,,18,27,29,0,14,"SOC FERMENTATION BIOENGINEERING, JAPAN",OSAKA,"OSAKA UNIV, FACULTY ENGINEERING, 2-1 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, OSAKA, 565, JAPAN",0922-338X,,,J FERMENT BIOENG,J.

Existing methods are either complicated or not applicable to systems utilizing collagen-based materials, and the development of a rapid and simple technique would be an advantage. In the current paper, a method is described which relies on the radiolabelling of newly synthesized protein with [(3)H]-proline followed by specific precipitation of collagen using 1% sirius red dissolved in water. The results indicate that collagen binding to sirius red is unaffected by using water rather than picric acid as a solvent and the dye binds in a similar fashion to collagen type I, II and III. Cycloheximide treatment of the gels indicated that precipitated [(3)H]-proline was restricted to macromolecular protein. Collagenase treatment eradicated labelled precipitation formation when using 1% sirius red in water, indicating a high degree of specificity for collagen whilst specificity was poor when using 1% sirius red in picric acid. The method described is both simple and rapid and shows a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. For these reasons it is highly suited for the assessment of collagen synthesis by cells in collagen-based materials.","UCL, Sch Med, Inst Orthopaed, IRC Biomed Mat, Stanmore HA7 4LP, Middx, England; Univ London Queen Mary & Westfield Coll, IRC Biomed Mat, London E1 4NS, England","Lee, DA (reprint author), UCL, Sch Med, Inst Orthopaed, IRC Biomed Mat, Brockley Hill, Stanmore HA7 4LP, Middx, England.",,,"Lee, David/0000-0001-7646-4643",,,,17,26,26,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The uptake of nickel by cells in the oral tissues is a critical factor in assessing the biological liabilities of nickel. Nickel uptake by macrophages may be particularly important because of the central role of macrophages in the inflammatory process and the known role of the macrophage in orchestrating the response to biomaterials. The aims of the current study were to assess the reversibility of the uptake of nickel from human macrophages and determine the portion of the nickel which reaches the nuclei as a function of time. Cellular nickel content was measured by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. Nuclear nickel content was assessed after fractionating cells. The results showed that nickel was rapidly taken up by macrophages and that the nickel accumulated in the nucleus in as little as 8 h. After 48 h, over 60% of the cellular nickel was in the nucleus. Once taken up, the nickel was lost at a lower rate. The rate of loss decreased as the initial exposure time to the nickel increased. Thus, the results indicated that macrophages may accumulate nickel if the time between exposures is insufficient to reverse the uptake. Further studies are necessary to correlate the retention of nickel with impaired function of macrophages and to further define the biological risks of using nickel in dental alloys.","Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Dent, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Wataha, JC (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Rehabil, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",,,,,,,31,23,24,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-182X,,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The stimulation of fibroblast growth is essential for the normal healing and tissue integration of biomaterials. The local elevation of proinflammatory mediators in infected perigraft fluid (PGF) may inhibit this growth. We sought to determine whether infected PGF inhibited fibroblast growth, and, if so, whether this was primarily dependent on the biomaterial, bacteria, or host. Methods. In vivo Dacron or expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts, sterile or colonized with slime-producing (RP-62A, viable or formalin-killed) or nonslime-producing (RP-62NA) Staphylococcus epidermidis (1 x 10(7) CFU/cm(2)), were implanted in Swiss Webster mice, and the PGF was harvested at 7 and 28 days. Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 alpha, interferon gamma (7 gamma g/day), and indomethacin (50 mu g/day) were administered by microinfusion pumps for 7 days and the PGF was harvested. Inhibition of the proinflammatory mediators was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. The nontreated, heat-treated, or trypsin-digested in vivo PGF was incubated with an in vitro [H-3]thymidine murine fibroblast (ATCC CCL-12) proliferation assay. Results. Fibroblast inhibition was significant at 7 and 28 days with infected PGF incubation compared with sterile and was not dependent on bacterial slime production or viability. Dacron sterile PGF did not significantly inhibit fibroblasts compared with control, whereas sterile ePTFE stimulated (P < 0.05) fibroblasts, Treatment of the PGF with proinflammatory cytokines, heat, and trypsin failed to reverse fibroblast inhibition in the infected state. Conclusion. Biomaterial infection is associated with fibroblast inhibition that is dependent primarily on bacterial products and not the host or biomaterial, Conservative intervention strategies for graft infection need to address the problem of poor healing as well as bacterial clearance.

Polyurethanes were used as the model materials. The tumor promoting activities of polyurethanes were strong, whereas the initiating activities were weak. Such promoting activities were associated with the inhibition of the function of the connexins which play an important role in the gap-junctional intercellular communications, and the inhibition might be caused by many factors such as additives, catalysts, leachable oligomers, and material surface characteristic, which have tumor-promoting activities via inhibitory action on gap-junctional intercellular communication in polymers. From these results, two in vitro methods, namely gap-junctional intercellular communication test (example: V79 metabolic cooperation test) and 2-stage Balb 3T3 cell transformation test, are considered to be useful for evaluating the tumorigenic potentials of polymers.","Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Divices, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1580098, Japan","Tsuchiya, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Med Divices, Setagaya Ku, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo 1580098, Japan.",,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,SOC POLYMER SCIENCE JAPAN,TOKYO,"TSUKIJI DAISAN NAGAOKA BLDG, 2-4-2 TSUKIJI, CHUO-KU, TOKYO, 104, JAPAN",0386-2186,,,KOBUNSHI RONBUNSHU,Kobunshi Ronbunshu,,1998.0,55,6,,,,,314,322,,10.1295/koron.55.314,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,ZW947,WOS:000074464300002,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

Nitrogen ions of 500 eV/at. and argon ions of 3 keV/at. under partial pressure of oxygen were used to bombard the surface of polycarbonate (PC) samples to a fluence of 5x10(16) at/cm(2) and 2.1x10(17) at./cm(2), respectively. After implantation, the samples were stored in two different environments (oxygen and argon) over controlled intervals of time (1 to 24 hours). Characterization of samples was performed by means of XPS, ERD ExB and RES. The results show an increase of the oxygen concentration near the surface for all implanted samples. Also, desorption of hydrogen was observed after implantation of argon under a partial pressure of oxygen. These results confirm the formation of new functional groups such as C-OK for all treatments.

The experimental and theoretical melting curves are both fairly symmetrical and possess nearly identical T-m values. Calculated melting of coding and flanking DNA regions indicates that flanking DNAs are more (A+T)-rich than coding sequences and account for the earliest melting DNA. Calculated melting curves of the 16 individual yeast chromosomes are very similar and with few exceptions exhibit symmetric melting curves. MELTSIM was also used to calculate a theoretical denaturation map of Chromosome III DNA. The agreement between MELTSIM calculated and experimental melting data demonstrates our ability to accurately simulate long DNA sequence melting in complex eukaryotic genomes, whose sequences are becoming increasingly available for study in public databases. This has important consequences for the understanding of sequence dependent energetic properties of DNA in their biological sequence context and also for their potential use in biomaterials applications.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Lowell, MA 01854 USA","Bizzaro, JW (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.",,,,,,,0,5,5,0,1,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-394-0,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,1998.0,489,,,,,,73,75,,,,,,3,Biophysics; Cell Biology,Biophysics; Cell Biology,BM11Z,WOS:000077674600012,,,,,2019-02-25

Multicomponent blends of synthetic, semi-synthetic and naturally occurring macromolecules have been evaluated with a particular interest in the preparation of immunoisolation barriers for pancreatic islets. A screening has resulted in thirty three polymeric systems which have been compared according to their mechanical strength, capsule characteristics (such as shape, surface smoothness, stability, and swelling/shrinking) and per meability (MWCO). A limited number of tests were also carried out on the cell viability in the presence of polymer mixtures. These included measurements of the perifusion of encapsulated pancreatic islets and the host tissue response. The quality of the membrane produced was observed to be a strong function of the polymer properties, processing conditions, such as the type and concentration of the simple electrolyte, and the reaction time. Additionally, a multi component polyelectrolyte technology based on the formation of a capsular ""wall-complex"" was developed for the simultaneous optimization of the membrane mechanical properties and permeability. This involved the preparation of a wide pore matrix through the reaction of a core polyanion with a small ionotropic ion. A second, low or medium molecular weight, polycation was subsequently added, in a second reactive stage, and its time dependent diffusion into the capsule could be used to control the membrane wall thickness and permeability. Alternatively, the simultaneous application of low and high molecular weight cations (or a divalent and polyvalent cation) often led to capsules with similar controllable properties. For many combinations, a distinct capsular wall was observed. Overall seven chemistries were identified as providing suitable permeability and capsular mechanical properties. All contained an anionic polysaccharide blend interior to an oligocation solution. The alginate/cellulose sulfate//polymethylene-co-guanidine/calcium chloride/sodium chloride system was found to be the most viable alternative to the standard alginate-polylysine-alginate capsule (APA).","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Polymers & Biomat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med Endocrinol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Micrograv Res & Applicat, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Hunkeler, D (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Polymers & Biomat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",david.hunkeler@epfl.ch,,,,,,29,42,45,0,14,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN 33,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, W-1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY",0065-3195,,,ADV POLYM SCI,,,1998.0,136,,,,,,53,73,,,,,,21,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,BL16Q,WOS:000074527400002,,,,,2019-02-25

That EC might be very relevant to other aspects of haemocompatibility has not received much attention. The highly reactive nature of the endothelium, however, makes it an important candidate for a regulatory role in the reactions to intravascular implants, whether in the short-term (e.g. catheters, haemodialysis) or in the long-term, as in prosthetic heart valves or vascular stents. In the present paper the ability of biomaterials to alter the activation state of the endothelium, both in the vicinity of, as well as at a distance from a cardiovascular implant, will be discussed. Among the relevant activating signals affecting EC are metal ions, bacterial toxins and mediators from blood cells and plasma cascade systems, which can elicit EC production of inflammatory mediators and up-regulate cell adhesion molecules (CAM). This in turn can lead to an amplification of the inflammatory response. These complex reactions are intricately involved in the complications associated with such biomaterial applications. Nevertheless, knowledge of these pathomechanisms could offer the possibility of therapeutic control, in order to minimize the negative effects.

Many currently applied biomaterials are selected more or less on an empirical basis because knowledge of the basic mechanisms of cell-material interactions is still limited. Indeed,a better understanding of the ongoing processes at the cellular and intracellular level during interaction of anchorage-dependent cells with biomaterials may help in the development of tailor-made biomaterials. Much of the contemporary research activities restrict to investigations of the characterisation of physicochemical material properties, protein adsorption, and macroscopic parameters of cell behaviour. We have tried to relate the change in tissue compatibility, with altered wettability of model substrata, to the adsorption of fibronectin (FN), the organisation of integrin receptors (alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin), cellular signalling processes, and FN matrix formation. Results of these investigations have shown that a decreased compatibility of biomaterials seems to be due to conformational changes of FN adsorbed with high binding strength on the substratum which inhibits appropriate organisation of FN receptors and signal transmission into the cell. As a consequence, it was observed that cells could not organise a normal extracellular matrix and hadtherefore a decreased ability to proliferate.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Chem, D-145613 Teltow, Germany","Groth, T (reprint author), GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Chem, Kantstr 55, D-145613 Teltow, Germany.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,0,15,15,0,0,I O S PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-6743,,90-5199-365-X,BIOM HLTH R,,,1998.0,16,,,,,,12,23,,,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,BL79T,WOS:000076774700002,,,,,2019-02-25

Prime factors in the thrombogenicity of synthetic materials in contact with blood include gas nuclei at the blood gas interface as well as the inherent thrombogenicity of the materials themselves. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular prostheses were denucleated by placement in acetone and ethanol followed by degassed saline or by placement in degassed saline subjected to hydrostatic pressure. Heparinized grafts were prepared by coating with tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC), followed by immersion in heparin. Grafts were installed to reconstruct-the femoral artery (1 x 10 mm) or as renal iliac bypasses (1 x 50 mm) in rats. In the femoral artery reconstruction model, control grafts thrombosed within 10 minutes of implantation. All acetone denucleated femoral grafts remained patent for 60 minutes but were occluded at day 1. All pressure denucleated femoral grafts remained patent for 60 minutes, whereas six were patent at 1 month. In contrast, 11 of 15 heparinized femoral grafts were patent at 1 month. In the renal iliac bypass model, all control grafts were thrombosed within 10 minutes, whereas all heparin bonded grafts remained patent at 1 month. This finding confirms that removal of air from small diameter ePTFE grafts decreases acute thrombogenicity and that heparin bonding further decreases thrombogenicity, suggesting that clinically useful lengths of microvascular prostheses may be possible.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Surg, Div Plast Reconstruct Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Plast Surg Res Labs, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Klitzman, B (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Box 3906, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",,,,,,,21,18,20,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0032-1052,1529-4242,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

Rutile was selected as the reference, and the Reference Intensity Ratios (RIR) were accurately measured. A RIR database of XRPD quantitative analysis for biomaterials based on calcium phosphate was established. The principals and method of RIR quantitative analysis were introduced. The phase amounts of biomaterials based on calcium phosphate could be analyzed accurately, quickly and conveniently. The relative error is less than 5%. The absorption effect was totally eliminated and the cumbersome calibration curve procedure was shunted.

The national and international standards for testing regimes represent a lowest common denominator for such applications and do not necessarily ensure that optimal function will be achieved. The authors' thesis is that biocompatibility testing has scope for extensive development with respect to biofunctionality. The present paper reviews current trends in the in vitro aspects of biocompatibility testing. As well as a critical appraisal of the recent literature, future trends are also stressed, which the authors regard as essential for a meaningful integration of a modern biological approach into new developments in the material sciences.

Although bone banks, such as Eurotransplant, are founded to supply such substitutes, natural bone is not always adequate. For-example, frequently these so-called bone grafts resorb after implantation (1). Further, they cannot be used for joint and tooth replacement, and recently worries have been raised about the transfer of infectious diseases. Therefore, interest has dramatically increased in the use of synthetic materials for replacement of lost or damaged bone tissue. The generic name of these tissue alternatives is biomaterials. A special class of these biomaterials is composed of metallic devices with coatings to improve bone bonding. These specialized coatings used to improve the metallic implant are the topic of this paper.","Leiden Univ, Biomat Res Grp, Leiden, Netherlands","de Groot, K (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Biomat Res Grp, Leiden, Netherlands.",,"Wolke, J.G.C./L-4768-2015",,,,,103,182,182,2,44,PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD,BURY ST EDMUNDS,"NORTHGATE AVENUE,, BURY ST EDMUNDS, SUFFOLK, ENGLAND IP32 6BW",0954-4119,,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

It is recently considered that wear of the UHMWPE cup is of major concern. Generation of the wear debris can have adverse effects on the body, both localized and systemic. It is envisaged that wear of the prosthetic components, particularly those fabricated from UHMWPE can be reduced through the use of surface coatings. The aim of this investigation was to deposit a selection of refractory element nitride-based coatings (TiN, TiAIN, ZrN) onto 316L stainless steel substrates, using physical vapour deposition (PVD) technology and to study their sliding wear behaviour in contact with both UHMWPE and 316L stainless steel pins, using a pin-on-plate testing rig. Tests were conducted in Ringers solution and Ringers solution plus bone cement particles. The volume of material removed from the pins served as an indication of their wear behaviour. Wear mechanisms were identified using scanning electron microscopy. The results of these findings and the potential for these coatings to be used in orthopaedic applications are discussed.","Univ S Australia, Ian Wark Res Inst, The Levels, SA, Australia","Ward, LP (reprint author), Royal Melbourne Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",,"Ward, Liam/B-5033-2019","Ward, Liam/0000-0002-8025-7425",,,,30,23,23,2,9,PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD,BURY ST EDMUNDS,"NORTHGATE AVENUE,, BURY ST EDMUNDS, SUFFOLK, ENGLAND IP32 6BW",0954-4119,,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

In this paper the use of computer modelling for the design of biomaterials is discussed. The word 'biomaterials' is interpreted in its broadest sense, i.e. referring to any foreign object brought into the body for temporary or permanent use. Computer modelling will first be discussed as a tool to model biological structures (bones, arteries) or to investigate and simulate biological interactions at implant-host interfaces. It will then be illustrated how computer modelling, using insights gained from the modelling of the biological structures themselves, is used in the design process of dental, orthopaedic and cardiovascular prostheses. The area of computer modelling for biomaterials applications has become so vast that an exhaustive overview is impossible in the framework of one paper. Rather, some illustrative case studies will be discussed which are, in the opinion of the authors, representative of general trends in this challenging domain of science on the boundary between engineering and medicine.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Biomech & Engn Design, Louvain, Belgium","Sloten, JV (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Biomech & Engn Design, Louvain, Belgium.",,"HO BA THO, Marie-Christine/J-1946-2012","HO BA THO, Marie-Christine/0000-0003-1192-0075",,,,90,11,12,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0954-4119,2041-3033,,P I MECH ENG H,Proc.

It is now routinely being deposited onto the stems of surgical implants to achieve cementless fixation to bone. Despite its favourable osteoconductive and bioactive properties, HA is still a main obstacle in the area of orthopaedics applications where implants have to withstand medium high loading. Therefore, to bridge the gap in biomaterials with HA having low load bearing characteristics, bioceramic composite coatings are being developed. Two different kinds of HA composite coatings are being studied, namely HA/Ti-6Al-4V and HA/Y-ZrO2 (Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia). HA combined with non-toxicity and bioinert Ti-6Al-4V provides an implant that is biocompatible, light and stable. Likewise, HA combined with biocompatible Y-ZrO2 gives an implant that is favourable in its strength and fracture toughness. plasma spraying technique is a popular method of depositing the composite powders. This paper investigates the influence of plasma spraying currents and gun transverse speeds on the characteristics of the composite coatings. Mechanical properties of the individual layers were tested using the tensile adhesion test (ASTM C-633). The surface morphology and microstructure of the composite layers were examined by a backscattered scanning electron microscope. The phase composition and crystallinity were determined by the X-ray diffractometer. For HA/Ti6Al-4V coatings, investigations revealed that the individual layers are more porous in the HA-rich regions. Tensile adhesion test showed a higher bond strength for the composite coatings compared to pure HA coatings. A lower spraying current and a faster gun transverse speed are also accountable for the porous microstructure and low bonding strength. For HAPT-ZrO2 coatings, the amount of HA decomposition increases with increasing spraying currents. The impurities were alpha-TCP and CaO with small amount of TTCP being detected. Y-ZrO2 reacted with CaO in HA to form CaZrO3, which caused an increase in the decomposition of the CaO-poor HA.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Khor, KA (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,"Khor, Khiam Aik/G-2827-2010; Khor, Khiam Aik (Michael)/B-6929-2009","KHOR, Khiam/0000-0003-1954-8423",,,,0,0,0,0,9,"MINERALS, METALS & MATERIALS SOC",WARRENDALE,"184 THORN HILL RD, WARRENDALE, PA 15086-7514 USA",,,0-87339-415-1,,,,1998.0,,,,,,,195,209,,,,,,15,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Materials Science, Composites",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BM03W,WOS:000077459300014,,,,,2019-02-25

It has been established that solid waste incineration resulted in a formation of a slag product composed of stable mineral phases: oxyapatite, nagelschmidtite, spinels, karnegiite, which can be considered as host phases for radionuclide immobilization. Waste vitrification with metal fuel yields an amorphous phase which is predominant in final products, and a small amount of crystalline phases. Preliminary leaching tests were carried out.

These multifaceted requirements can be met by functionally graded materials (FGM). Biomaterials for implants have to display a wide range of adaptability to suit the various stages of the biointegration of a foreign material into the human body. This paper reports the preparation of functionally graded bioceramic coatings that are composed of essentially calcium phosphate compounds. Two FGM systems were investigated. System 1 utilised the thermal response of different size ranges of hydroxyapatite (HA) powders in the plasma name to form the gradient in biological/physical properties while System 2 synergized two types of calcium phosphates, namely, cr-tricalcium phosphate and HA, to form the FGM. The coating is graded in accordance to adhesive strength and bioresorbability. The bond coat on the metal stub is deposited with a particle range of HA that will provide high adhesive strength but have poor biocompatibility. The top coat of System 1 is composed of a particle size range of HA that elicit a layer that is highly biocompatible while in System 2, the top coat is mainly a-tricalcium phosphate that is highly bioresorbable. This arrangement has the propensity of allowing accelerated biointegration of the coating by the body tissues. The processing steps and problems will be highlighted in this paper as well as the results of post-spray treatment by conventional heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing (HIP).","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Khor, KA (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,"Khor, Khiam Aik/G-2827-2010; Khor, Khiam Aik (Michael)/B-6929-2009",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,INST MATERIALS,LONDON,"1 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5DB, ENGLAND",,,1-86125-055-X,,,,1998.0,,,,,,,1038,1050,,,,,,13,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BN40T,WOS:000081833400113,,,,,2019-02-25

Heparin was partially degraded and the resulting fragments were covalently end-point attached to 0.5 cm long silicone biomaterial surface. Collagen type I was immobilized on the heparinized biomaterials and then cross-linked with acyl-azide or carbodiimide. Finally, the resulting biosurfaces were exposed to antibiotics, i.e. rifampicin in combination with cefuroxime, fusidic acid, ofloxacin or vancomycin, respectively. The antibiotic bonded biomaterials were evaluated for their anti-staphylococcal activity after elution in NaCl, serum or blood by measuring the zones of inhibition for S. epidermidis strain RP12. Furthermore, we examined the in-vitro colonization resistance to S. epidermidis RP12 for these combinations of rifampicin-bonded biomaterials by an ATP bioluminescence assay. The ATP measurements showed that initially adherent bacteria were eradicated from the polymer surface, for at least 24 or 48 h (fusidic acid > cefuroxime > vancomycin > ofloxacin).
