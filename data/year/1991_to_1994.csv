The authors evaluated two bone substitutes in a posterolateral spinal arthrodesis (PSA) model in sheep: coral porites (99% calcium carbonate, Biocoral Registered Trademark , Inoteb, France) and a biphasic ceramic (BCP) (65% hydroxyapatite and 35% B tricalcium phosphate, Triosite Registered Trademark, Zimmer International). Summary of Background Data, Bone substitutes would be of great interest for PSA. Previous trials began with two kinds of biomaterials: natural coralline calcium carbonate, and phosphate calcium ceramic. Methods. A lumbar PSA was performed in 11 sheep (coral group) and in 9 sheep (BCP group). Sacrifice and biomechanical tests were performed after 1 year. Results. A large decrease of flexibility in all directions was obtained with both coral PSA and BCP PSA similarly to autologous graft. No nonfusion case was observed. Conclusion, in conditions close to the human surgery, a PSA can be obtained using either coral porites or BCP as bone substitutes.","INST CALOT,INST RECH MALADIES SQUELETTE,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE; INST CALOT,CHIRURG RACHIS SERV,BERCK,FRANCE; ECOLE NATL SUPER ARTS & METIERS,BIOMECH LAB,PARIS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,0,38,38,0,5,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,DEC 15,1994.0,19,24,,,,,2798,2803,,10.1097/00007632-199412150-00012,,,,6,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,PY226,WOS:A1994PY22600012,7899982.0,,,,2019-02-25

The purpose of this study was to develop a rat model in which capsular contracture occurred frequently and to determine whether surface texturing had any effect on the incidence or degree of capsular contracture as determined by in vivo biomechanical analysis of tissue modulus and histological examination of the tissue at the capsule-implant interface. A new sublatissimus implantation site in the rat was developed in an attempt to avoid subpannicular placement, which has been associated with inconsistent results because of contracture despite texturing, and a high rate of implant exposure secondary to trauma. Each rat (N = 43) was implanted with two devices-one smooth-surface 6-ml implant and one textured Biocell 6-ml implant-both with remote ports to allow for biomechanical analysis. Evaluation was carried out at 1, 2, and 3 months (n = 10) and 6 months (n = 5). Biomechanical evaluation of the implants was carried out in vivo and anonymously. The animals were then killed, and sectioning of the overlying capsule-implant interface from the dome of the implant was performed. Histological evaluation was carried out anonymously with regards to the implant type. Capsular contracture developed in smooth-surface devices in 95% of sites; this became evident on biomechanical analysis at 2 months and progressed to 3 months, after which it remained relatively stable. Capsular contracture did not develop in textured devices, but in all cases there was tissue adherence of the capsule to the implant at the interface. Histology confirmed disruption of collagen fiber alignment, increased cellularity and vascularity, and overall thinner capsules around the textured Biocell implants. This rat model provides an inexpensive animal model for further investigation of a difficult clinical problem. In vivo biomechanical analysis to determine tissue modulus has again been shown to be a sensitive method of defining overall soft-tissue contracture around implanted biomaterials.","SURG RES LAB,NASHVILLE,TN; BAPTIST HOSP,INST AESTHET & RECONSTRUCT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN; GRAND RAPIDS AREA MED EDUC CTR INC,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,GRAND RAPIDS,MI",,,,,,,,12,32,33,1,2,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",0148-7043,,,ANN PLAS SURG,Ann.

Since complement activation can play a role in this reaction, we checked in vitro the ability of empty alginate-polylysine microcapsules to activate complement. Human serum was incubated with microcapsules, and complement activation was evaluated by two methods: the complement hemolytic activity (CH50) and the assay of the C3adesArg fragment. The occurrence of complement activation in the presence of microcapsules was suggested both by a CH50 decrease and by high C3adesArg levels despite C3adesArg adsorption to the capsule membrane. Capsule membrane protection against the cytotoxic effects of complement was also tested. No hemolysis occurred when microencapsulated sensitized sheep erythrocytes were incubated with activated complement. In conclusion, the microcapsule membrane can protect cells against activated complement fragments.

Scanning electron microscopy observations of the surface of the seeded ceramic disks revealed that cells attached, spread, and proliferated on the material surface. Soaking in cell-free culture medium showed that no change occurred in the surface structure. However, when cultured with bone cells and observed under a transmission electron microscope, an electron-dense layer was noted initially at the surface of the material, before bone formation occurred. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis demonstrated the presence of calcium and phosphorus in this layer. Progressively, during the following days of culture, active osteoblasts synthetized and laid down an osteoid matrix composed of numerous collagen fibrils arranged either parallel or perpendicularly to the first-formed electron-dense layer. Mineralization initiated on the ceramic surface dispersed then along the collagenous fibrils, leading to a mineralized matrix which surrounded the ceramic particles. These results demonstrate the capacity of apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic to initiate biomineralization in osteoblast cultures and to achieve a direct bond between the surface apatite layer of the bioactive glass-ceramic and the mineralized bone matrix.","UNIV PARIS 07,BIOL ODONTOL LAB,PARIS,FRANCE; OSAKA KYOIKU UNIV,FAC ENGN,SAKYO KU,KYOTO 60601,JAPAN; UNIV PARIS 07,BIOL DEV LAB,F-75251 PARIS 05,FRANCE",,,,,,,,35,40,42,1,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0171-967X,,,CALCIFIED TISSUE INT,Calcif.

These carrier materials function as slow-delivery systems for BMP. By combination of BMP with different carrier materials such as various types of calcium phosphate ceramics, collagen or inactive collagenous bone matrix, and other organic and inorganic carriers, the biomaterial can be adapted to clinical demands in a wide range.

Samples of bone were sandwiched between holders of a different material and using this specimen configuration a new technique was developed to test the fracture toughness of the bone interlayer. The effects of different specimens sizes and holder materials were investigated empirically. Using finite element analysis a correction factor was determined to account for the finite thickness of the interlayer and the analytical solutions governing the test specimen were accordingly modified. Bulk compact tension specimens of bone were tested for comparison. Bath wet and dry bone were evaluated and the fracture surface morphology characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate no statistically significant differences between the fracture toughness values obtained from the compact tension and sandwich specimens.

Four days after implantation, specimens of the spleen and implanted rubber fragment were retrieved and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). In SEM, macrophages with membrane fusion and cytoplasmic spreading were noted on the surfaces of implanted rubber fragments. Specimens of the spleen from animals with implants showed light 3-10-mu m structures that were not observed in those without implants. EDX revealed the presence of silicon both in the rubber fragment and in the spleen of the implanted animals. Both light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed a large number of particles inside giant cells of the spleen.

To accomplish this objective, proper fixation, processing techniques, instrument quality control, and laboratory safety practices should be followed at all times. This paper reviews the methodology that has become standard practice in our laboratory for the evaluation of bone/implant interfaces. A regimen of fluorescent bone markers was used after implant placement to study rates of bone remodeling. At sacrifice, the tissue was perfused or immersed in an aldehyde or alcohol fixative. Implants were retrieved en bloc, radiographs made, and tissues embedded in plastic. Tissue implant blocks were cut longitudinally into 300-400 mu m thick wafers with a low speed saw equipped with a diamond blade. The wafers were glued to plexiglass slides and hand ground to approximately 25 mu m. Wafers were photographed with an epi-fluorescence microscope; radiographs were made in an X-ray cabinet; and the sections were stained for light microscopy evaluation. Various histomorphometric methods can be used to determine some variables of tissue remodeling around the implants from photomicrographs. Specimens prepared in this fashion can also be evaluated with a scanning or transmission electron microscope. These combined techniques provide a comprehensive approach for the evaluation of the bone/implant interface.","UNIV IOWA,COLL DENT,DEPT PROSTHODONT,IOWA CITY,IA; UNIV IOWA HOSP & CLIN,DEPT OTOLARYNGOL & PROSTHODONT,IOWA CITY,IA","KRIZAN, ME (reprint author), UNIV IOWA,HOSP DENT,COLL DENT,DIV ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURG,N442 DENT SCI BLDG,IOWA CITY,IA 52242, USA.",,,,,,,31,6,6,0,1,NATL SOC HISTOTECHNOLOGY,BOWIE,"4201 NORTHVIEW DR, STE 502, BOWIE, MD 20716-1073",0147-8885,,,J HISTOTECHNOL,J.

A chemico-physical and biological characterization was carried out on these ''bioartificial materials'' made of synthetic and biological polymers. The morphological and chemical properties of the films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The transport properties of these films were tested in liquid systems to evaluate their possible use in dialysis and/or haemodialysis. The biocompatibility was investigated by a haemocompatibility test based on the contact activation of plasma prekallikrein. No particular interaction between the two components was observed. The results of the permeation tests were compared with those obtained using commercial products such as Cuprophane and poly(acrylonitrile) membranes. These tests indicate that the permeability of the blends decreases as the content of the synthetic polymer increases.

The mechanisms involved in this process are only partly understood. STUDY DESIGN: Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) were grown on control polystyrene culture ware and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The binding of monoclonal antibodies against the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and the E-selectin by adherent HSVEC was determined by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were cocultured with HSVEC adherent to ePTFE and leukocyte binding was determined with and without the addition of a protein kinase C inhibitor. RESULTS: HSVEC adherent to ePTFE constitutively bound anti-ICAM-1 antibodies, which were attenuated by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7. HSVEC adherent to ePTFE bound significantly greater numbers of leukocytes than those on control (58 versus 41 percent, p<0.05). Incubation with H-7 decreased leukocyte binding to HSVEC significantly (p<0.005). Coculture of PBL with HSVEC adherent to ePTFE caused a tenfold increase in binding of anti-E-selectin antibodies (p<0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PBL binding to HSVEC adherent to ePTFE is, at least in part, ICAM-1 and E-selectin dependent.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT SURG,DIV GEN SURG,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,AMER COLL SURGEONS,CHICAGO,"54 EAST ERIE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60611",1072-7515,,,J AM COLL SURGEONS,J.

However, we recently proposed and realized a new strategy to design a bioactive material, on which biosignal molecules such as cell-growth-factor proteins and cell-adhesion-factor proteins were immobilized. The immobilized biosignal molecules were not only bioactive without being incorporated into the cell, but also more active than free (soluble) ones. In this review, some evidence to demonstrate that the effect of immobilized biosignal is based on biospecific interactions with cellular receptors is shown. In addition, the explanation for the strong effect of the biosignalling, some efforts to further enhance the effect, and various applications of the biosignal molecules-immobilized biomaterials are described.

As for the additives, three chemicals among eight antioxidants showed stronger inhibitory activities than BHT, a tumor promotor.

Polymers containing spiroorthocarbonates (SOCs) show promise in this respect, but their toxicology in copolymerized materials has not been explored. In this study, the in vitro toxicology of these materials in homopolymer form and in two trial non-shrinking epoxy co-polymers was evaluated for cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT test to measure the lethality effect on mouse L929 cells. Mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames-Salmonella Test. For comparison, commercial composite and adhesive materials as well as several other materials of current interest in dentistry were also evaluated. Epoxy resin samples containing 5% of either T/T SOC or Dp SOC reduced the cytotoxicity (TC50) from approximately 400 to 800 mu g/200 mu l. The epoxy-spiro copolymers had more favorable TC50 values than the commercial product Super-Bond. They showed TC50 values on the order of 35% greater than Super-Bond and 45% less than Scotchbond 2, the latter two being materials currently used in the clinic. These two comparatives demonstrated dose response curves with lower doses at maximum cell kill values than the spiro materials. The epoxy formulations all showed weak mutagenesis, but this is attributed to the epoxy formulation and not the SOCs. Although considerable toxicology is yet be conducted, these in vitro results suggest that biocompatible copolymer formulations for spiroorthocarbonates are a developmental reality.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH DENT,DEPT ORAL BIOL,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108; MIDWEST RES INST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64110","YOURTEE, DM (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,SCH PHARM,TOXICORE LABS,2411 HOLMES ST,KANSAS CITY,MO 64108, USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [P01 DE09696, R01 DE08450]",,,17,5,8,0,2,P J D PUBLICATIONS LTD,WESTBURY,"PO BOX 966, WESTBURY, NY 11590",1078-0297,,,RES COMMUN MOL PATH,Res.

The biological interaction between these materials and blood was studied by in vitro and ex vivo methods. Silicone rubber tubes were copolymerized with acrylamide and N-vinylpyrrolidone by radiation-grafting techniques. The irradiation was performed with gamma-rays from a Co-60 source at a constant dose rate (0.2 kGy/h) for various time intervals (4-15 h). To evaluate the antithrombogenicity of the grafted tubes, the surface adsorption of I-125-albumin and I-125-fibrinogen was studied. All graft copolymers show a preference for albumin, and the degree of preference appears to correlate with antithrombogenic tendency. In the ex vivo experiment with animals, tubes were implanted in the carotid artery of dogs and the blood flow in the graft copolymers was detected with an ultrasonic flow meter. The blood flow rate in the ungrafted implants decreased more rapidly (stopped completely after 15 to 210 min) compared to the flow rate in the grafted ones (decreased slowly from 38 to 35 ml/min and 70 to 60 ml/min). There was a direct relationship between both methods in the study of blood compatibility of the materials. The results suggest that the graft copolymers can be used as biomaterials for long-term use in cardiovascular systems.","EFEI, INST CIENCIAS, DEPT CIENCIAS, BR-37500000 ITAJUBA, BRAZIL; IPEN CNEN SP, BR-05508900 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL; INCOR, INST CORACAO, BR-01246903 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,0,ASSOC BRAS DIVULG CIENTIFICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE MEDICINA, SALA 21, 14049 RIBEIRAO PRETO, SAO PAULO, 00, BRAZIL",0100-879X,,,BRAZ J MED BIOL RES,Brazilian J.

These polymers were evaluated with respect to their possible use as radiopaque implant biomaterials-that is, materials that are visible in a noninvasive manner using routine X-ray absorption imaging techniques. Polymer A is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 1 (80 and 20 mol%, respectively). Polymer B was prepared from MMA, 1, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) (mel ratio 65:20:15, respectively). Compound 1 was synthesized from 4-iodophenol and methacryloyl chloride. The resulting polymers were characterized with GPC, DSC, NMR, and by measuring both the advancing and receding contact angles. Thrombogenicity of the polymers was determined by an in vitro thrombin generation test procedure. The maximum concentration of free thrombin was 76 +/- 1 nM for polymer A, and 64 +/- 3 nM for polymer B. The lag times (i.e., time onset of thrombin generation) were 392 seconds for polymer A and 553 seconds for polymer B. For PVC-T, which is known as a passive material, a lag time of 583 seconds was found. This indicates that polymer B is comparable to PVC-T, and more passive than polymer A. Polymer A exhibited minor activation of platelets. Polymer B did not induce platelet activation at all. The polymers exhibited, even as fibers with a diameter of ca. 0.3 mm, good radiopacity with routine imaging X-ray techniques in the clinic. It is argued that polymers A and B-which actually represent a whole family of radiopaque polymeric biomaterials-exhibit promising properties with respect to applications as construction materials for a new generation of endovascular stents.

Using a computer-assisted cell counting method, it was shown that the membrane thickness was a stable parameter that poorly correlated with the other histomorphometric parameters except fibrocyte distance parameters. Macrophages were significant in number only in the short term and were always located at the implant-tissue interface. At 4 weeks, the period corresponding to which macrophages disappeared, fibrocytes were found nearer the interface than at earlier periods and did not migrate for up to 52 weeks, although their densities decreased to 50% of their initial values. Therefore, it can be histomorphometrically confirmed that 1) the presence of an implant induced delay in the healing process; 2) the immune system was not usually involved in the response to bulk metals; and 3) at early time periods, the presence of PMN cells was correlated to the long-term number of macrophages. On the contrary, the histomorphometric findings suggested that around the tested materials, a large number of macrophages did not induce an immediate or a delayed fibrocyte proliferation. If one considers that a low fibrocyte surface density is related to activated cells surrounded by a matrix high in collagen content, then the large number of macrophages induced the stimulation of collagen synthesis by the fibrocytes already included in the membrane. Accordingly, in the short-term, a high fibrocyte density and few macrophages may be a criterion for testing biocompatibility.

However, with rare exceptions, only IOLs designed for adults are currently available. These lenses may be difficult to insert into small eyes. Since the pediatric crystalline lens is smaller than that of adults and because the capsular bag does not continue to grow after lensectomy, it is worthwhile to determine the biomaterials, designs, and sizes that may be appropriate for pediatric implantation. In a study of 50 pediatric eyes obtained postmortem, we have documented an estimated growth curve for the developing crystalline lens between birth and 16 years of age. Ninety percent of crystalline lens growth occurs during the first two years of life. Based on these data and this study using the Miyake posterior view analysis of implanted standard and prototype IOLs, we recommend the following: Clinical trials of capsular IOLs, downsized to approximately 10.0 mm diameter, are appropriate for children under two years of age. Capsular IOLs are defined as flexible open-loop, one-piece, all poly(methyl methacrylate), modified C-loop designs made specifically for in-the-bag placement. Because the rapid growth phase of the lens is complete by the age of two, we believe that downsizing the IOL is not necessary after this age unless axial length measurements indicate an unusually small eye. Standard flexible 12.0 mm to 12.5 mm diameter capsular IOLs can be safely implanted. Such lenses could be tolerated throughout life, obviating the need for later IOL exchange.",,"WILSON, ME (reprint author), MED UNIV S CAROLINA,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,STORM EYE INST,CTR INTRAOCULAR LENS RES,CHARLESTON,SC 29425, USA.",,,,,,,0,57,60,0,0,AMER SOC CATARACT REFRACTIVE SURGERY,FAIRFAX,"4000 LEGATO RD, SUITE 850, FAIRFAX, VA 22030",0886-3350,,,J CATARACT REFR SURG,J.

Four interrelated properties of biomaterials (chemical composition, surface energy, surface roughness, and surface topography) affect mesenchymal cells in vitro. Attachment, proliferation, metabolism, matrix synthesis, and differentiation of osteoblast-like cell lines and primary chondrocytes are sensitive to one or more of these properties. The nature of the response depends on cell maturation state. Rarely do differentiated osteoblasts or chondrocytes see a material prior to its modification by biological fluids, immune cells and less differentiated mesenchymal cells in vivo. Studies using the rat marrow ablation model of endosteal wound healing indicate that ability of osteoblasts to synthesize and calcify their extracellular matrix is affected by the local presence of the material. Changes in the morphology and biochemistry of matrix vesicles, extracellular organelles associated with matrix maturation and calcification, seen in normal endosteal healing, are altered by implants. Moreover, the material exerts a systemic effect on endosteal healing as well. This may be due to local effects on growth factor production and secretion into the circulation, as well as to the tact that the implant may serve as a bioreactor.

The model proposes a reaction-diffusion mechanism for multiple proteins, involving interactions between diffusive-convective protein transport from the bulk solution and competitive adsorption and displacement kinetics-on the surface. The resulting equations in time and space were solved numerically with a finite difference approach. Using a simulated dilute plasma solution consisting of albumin, immunoglobulin-gamma, and fibrinogen at their physiological proportions, the phenomenon of sequential protein adsorption and displacement on the surface(known as the Vroman effect), was shown. Explanations were obtained for several other phenomena observed by biomaterials researchers studying protein adsorption. The model also allows the study of how the modification of surface parameters can determine adsorption behavior. This study not only demonstrates the complexity of the adsorption process but also shows that it can be quantified by comprehensive models.

We have exploited differently modified polystyrenes, specific component-depleted sera, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to leukocyte integrins to ask what adhesion mechanisms mediate human blood monocyte adhesion to different surfaces in vitro. Preliminary findings are that monocyte interactions with fluorinated, siliconized, nitrogenated, and oxygenated surfaces are reduced by 50-100% when complement component C3-depleted serum is used for adsorption; reductions vary with material surface properties. Adhesion is restored on all surfaces when C3-depleted serum is replenished with purified C3. Monocyte adhesion to serum-adsorbed surfaces is inhibited by mAbs to the leukocyte integrin beta subunit, CD18 (mAbs 60.3 and MHM23), and partially inhibited by a mAb to the a submit, CD11b (mAb 60.1), suggesting adhesive interactions between adsorbed C3bi (the hemolytically inactive form of the C3b fragment) and the leukocyte integrin CD11b/CD18. However, adsorbed fibrinogen reduces the effectiveness of these mAbs, indicating that alternative adhesion mechanisms may operate depending on the propensities of critical adhesion-mediating components to be adsorbed onto different surfaces.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA",,,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL33849],,,43,133,134,0,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Membrane materials were the uncharged regenerated cellulose, the synthetic polysulphone (PS), a positively charged diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-C), the negatively charged carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and acrylonitrile copolymer (AN). The experimental system involved perfusion with human fresh venous blood through different modules containing the materials in the form of hollow fibre membranes. Extracellular and intracellular aspects of blood reactions after the first contact with the materials were investigated in Ficoll-separated granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Investigations were done by release reactions of platelet activating factor (PAF), oxygen radical (O-2(-)), leukotriene B-4, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6). The intracellular activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was done by mRNA transcription of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG). From the set of parameters, release reactions were only measurable for PAF, PGE(2) and O-2(-) if a second stimulus (phorbol myristate acetate, lipopolysaccharide, zymosan and calcium ionophore) was used after blood-membrane interaction. Although the extent of the release reaction was weak, negatively charged membranes were, in general, more active. All dialysers exhibited the same increase in beta 2-MG mRNA transcription, suggesting that all blood-contacting membranes initiate the gene expression of beta 2-MG at the same level. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-8 mRNAs were demonstrated in the AN and CMC membranes rather than the other materials, which exhibit a lower transcription than the tubing set. As has been found, an enhanced generation of PGE(2) for both CMC and AN membranes supports, therefore, the concept of an effect of the negative charges of the materials in the gene expression of cytokines. However, this initiation does not lead to the generation of cytokines, even after stimulation with pyrogens.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; HANNOVER MED SCH,DEPT NEPHROL,KONSTANTY GUTSCHOW STR 8,D-30623 HANNOVER,GERMANY",,,,,,,,44,11,11,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,969,980,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90077-9,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600003,7530999.0,,,,2019-02-25

The breaking stress for each was determined by means of tensile tests in which a constant strain rate was applied, and a tensile test with graduated stress and relaxation defined the elastic limit, i.e. the point beyond which deformation becomes irreversible. The study of the stress-strain curve during this elastic period enabled us to obtain the mathematical function that governs these reversible deformations, which shows excellence of fit (R(2) > 0.98). The prime derivative at each point of the resulting functions is the elastic modulus, the best parameter for comparing the elasticities of the suture threads. Since breaking stress alone does not suitably define the mechanical quality of a suture, we propose the use of other parameters during the elastic period, such as percentage of elongation at a point 10 times lower than the elastic limit (safety coefficient of 10), and tensile stress and elastic modulus at the said point, which are more reliable in the assessment of the resistance and elasticity of these threads.","CLIN PUERTA HIERRO, SERV BIOSTAT, E-28035 MADRID, SPAIN; ESCUELA SUPER TECN INGN IND, DEPT STRUCT MECH, E-28006 MADRID, SPAIN; INST NACL ESTADIST, E-28046 MADRID, SPAIN","PAEZ, JMG (reprint author), CLIN PUERTA HIERRO, SERV EXPTL SURG, SAN MARTIN PORRES 4, E-28035 MADRID, SPAIN.",,,,,,,16,18,18,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,981,984,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90078-7,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600004,7841295.0,,,,2019-02-25

The structure and properties of collagen fibres are defined by the magnitudes of electrostatic and hydrophobic attractive forces between neighbouring collagen molecules within collagen fibres. The structure and mechanical properties of collagen fibre dispersions were studied by dynamic theological measurements and by polarized microscopy. Rheological measurements were performed over pHs ranging from 6 to 9 and over temperatures ranging from 283 to 298 K. At higher pHs, the fibre dispersions were found to possess more rigid fibres and stronger inter-fibre attractive forces. This response is argued to result from changes in the ionization of amino acid side chains, which result in larger net-electrostatic attractive forces. Raising the temperature caused fibres to rigidify through enhanced hydrophobic attractive forces. Gels formed by lower pH-higher temperature fibre dispersions possess different properties than gels formed at higher pHs and lower temperatures.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BERKELEY,CA 94720; CELTRIX PHARMACEUT INC,SANTA CLARA,CA 95052","ROSENBLATT, J (reprint author), COLLAGEN CORP,2500 FABER PL,PALO ALTO,CA 94303, USA.",,,,,,,35,66,66,3,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,OCT,1994.0,15,12,,,,,985,995,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90079-5,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PK886,WOS:A1994PK88600005,7841296.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the present study, machined, electropolished and anodically oxidized implants were prepared, surface characterized and inserted in the cortical bone of rabbits (7 wks and 12 wks). SEM, scanning Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed no differences in surface composition but marked differences in oxide thickness, surface topography and roughness. Light microscopic morphology and morphometry showed that all implants were in contact with bone, and had a large proportion of bone within the threads. The smooth, electropolished implants were surrounded by less bone than the machined implants with similar oxide thickness, (4-5 nm) and the anodically oxidized implants with thicker oxides (21 nm and 180 nm, respectively) after 7 wks. These studies show that a high degree of bone contact and bone formation can be achieved with titanium implants which are modified with respect to oxide thickness and surface topography.

For kinetic and thermodynamic reasons, surfaces are different from the corresponding bulk of the material, and contain reactive (unsaturated) bonds, which in turn lead to the formation of surface reactive layers (e.g., surface oxides on metals) and adsorbed contamination layers. The encounter with the biological environment leads to further surface reactions modifying the surface, and to the adsorption of water, ions, and biomolecules, which are continuously exchanged.

It already occurs in living systems where the dielectric and conductive properties of biomaterials are vital in sustaining activity. The transverse and lateral properties of interfaces, including the effects of molecular ordering, are considered and it is suggested that the advent of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies provides a significant opportunity for nano-metric dielectric studies. An important feature, suggested for future exploitation, is the cross-coupling in interfaces of force fields arising from electrical, mechanical, chemical and entropic potential gradients. Application of these concepts to biology and to the behavior of polymer gels which may lead to development of muscle-like actuators and transducers are considered.

The novel systems combine rhBMP-2 with dry powder microparticles of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The mixture of rhBMP-2 with PLGA microparticles is added to an aqueous solution of biopolymer to yield a semisolid paste. The biopolymers tested include autologous blood clot, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and sodium alginate cross-linked with calcium ion. Insoluble collageneous bone matrix was also studied as a control. Test articles were made at 0-, 10-, and 30-mu g doses of rhBMP-2 and implanted in 8-mm-diameter rat carvarial defects (which will not heal if left untreated). The animals were examined 21 days after implantation by radiography, radiomorphometry, histology, and histomorphometry. All tested materials containing rhBMP-2 restored radiopacity and normal contouring to the calvarial defects. Samples without added rhBMP-2 yielded only soft tissue within the defects. Histology showed restoration of inner and outer bone tables plus marrow constituents. The PLGA microparticles were significantly resorbed at the 21-day time point. Although small differences between delivery systems were evident at 0- and 10-mu g rhBMP-2 doses, all test articles performed essentially equivalently at the 30-mu g dose. Thus, novel delivery systems for rhBMP-2 offer the promise of combining the intrinsic bioactivity of the osteoinductive protein with pharmaceutically acceptable biomaterials.

The polyurethanes were selected to reflect variations in the hard-segment chemistry, soft-segment chemistry, and polyurethane hydrophilicity resulting from combinations of hydrophobic/hydrophilic soft segments. All materials were characterized using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, size exclusion chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The material surfaces were examined both before and after incubation with enzyme and control solutions using scanning electron microscopy. Biodegradation assays were carried out at 37 degrees C using cholesterol esterase (CE) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) under optimal pH conditions for each enzyme. The hydrolytic enzyme (CE) was effective in releasing degradation products that contained hard-segment components from some of the polyurethanes. HPLC analysis of products for a polyesterurethane synthesized with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) suggested that the bulk of the incorporated radiolabeled TDI was still covalently bonded within the cleaved chain segments of the original polymer and was not released as pure toluene diamine (TDA). The data suggest that urethane linkages in the soft-segment domains of phase separated polyetherurea-urethanes may be more prone to cleavage by CE than are the urea/urethane groups in the hard-segment domains. This could be related to the nature of the hard-segment domain structures. The oxidative enzyme (HRP) was not able to induce liberation of radiolabeled segments from either the polyether or polyester-based polyurethanes.

Whether promoting cell adhesion or selectively inhibiting cell-cell aggregation mediated by integrin cell surface receptors, RGD-containing peptides can be rationally designed to incorporate both stability and integrin specificity. Synthetic peptides containing this sequence have been linked to biodegradable biopolymers and introduced for the enhancement of dermal and corneal wound healing. By accelerating the healing reaction using RGD-containing peptides, the quality of regenerated tissue seems to be improved, the extent of fibrosis restricted, and the risk of microbial infection may be reduced. Controlling the degree of fibrosis that often accompanies the healing of wounds and the reaction of tissue to foreign materials can also be achieved by natural antagonists of fibrogenic activity of TGF-beta animal models of kidney fibrosis. These advances in the biotechnology of wound healing and tissue regeneration eventually will have an overall impact on the quality of health care.

We have employed self-assembled lipid microstructures in the development of a number of biomedical material applications. The blood substitute, liposome encapsulated hemoglobin, is being investigated for the in vivo delivery of hemoglobin without many of the inherent toxicities associated with the delivery of free hemoglobin. This investigation is currently focused on demonstrations of efficacy in stressed animal models and on the safety of administering this material in models of sepsis. The synthetic modification of phospholipids to include photopolymerizable moieties such as diacetylenes has resulted in the spontaneous self-assembly of a hollow microcylinder which we are investigating for the controlled release of growth factors in soft tissue regeneration. Self-assembled monolayers are also being explored for the ability to surface modify biomaterials for improved cell adhesion. Photolithographic techniques have been combined with monolayer deposition to fabricate coplanar patterns of cell adhesion and inhibiting moieties. This results in the ability to spatially control the adhesion of cells to biomaterial surfaces. These cell patterns can form the basis for understanding two- and three-dimensional cellular events on the biomaterial surface and for the fabrication of improved cell-based biocompatible surfaces.

During the last few years solid progress has been made in the area of tissue and organ regeneration. This new approach is based on the discovery that certain simple chemical analogs of extracellular matrices synthesized by graft copolymerization of a glycosaminoglycan onto type I collagen can induce synthesis of physiologic tissue in lesions which otherwise heal spontaneously by synthesis of scar tissue. This approach offers serious potential advantages over the alternatives listed above since the graft ''grows out'' of host tissue.

Recent advances in cellular and molecular biology of the growth and differentiation factors have set the stage for a symbiosis of biotechnology and biomaterials. Recent advances permit one to enunciate the rules of architecture for tissue engineering of bone and cartilage. The purification and cloning of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth factors such as platelet derived growth factors (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I) will allow the design of an optimal combination of signals to initiate and promote development of skeletal stem cells into cartilage and bone. Successful and optimal bone and cartilage formation is a synergy of inductive and conductive strategies governed by biomechanics, optimal load bearing, and motion. BMPs function as inductive signals. Biomaterials (both natural and synthetic) mimic the extracellular matrix and play a role in conduction of bone and cartilage. Examples of biomaterials include hydroxyapatite, polyanhydrides, polyphosphoesters, polylactic acid, and polyglycolic acid. The prospects for novel biomaterials are immense, and they likely will be a fertile growth industry. Cooperative ventures between academia and industry and technology transfer from the federal government augur well for an exciting future for clinical applications.

In the case of polymeric elastomers, these iatrogenic effects are likely intermediated by absorbed host proteins that spontaneously bind to the device surface, promoting both bacterial adherence and thrombotic events. We earlier attempted to produce biomaterial surfaces that would selectively bind host albumin because albumin-coated surfaces were known to diminish both coagulation and bacterial adherence. To this end, an albumin-binding high molecular weight dextran:Cibacron blue adduct was bulk incorporated into polyetherurethane (Keogh et al., J Biomed Mater Res 1992;26:441). The modified material bound albumin selectively and reversibly and showed evidence of enhanced biocompatibility. However, similar to 30% of the surface of this material was evidently unmodified and still capable of exerting the above adverse effects. In the present work, we have covalently surface-modified polyetherurethane with sequential additions of acrylamide, amino-propylmethacrylamide, dextran, and Cibacron blue. This derivatized polyurethane preferentially and reversibly binds albumin, even from complex mixtures of proteins such as plasma. Furthermore, this material inhibits the clotting of nonanticoagulated whole human blood (for >16 hours at room temperature), perhaps by virtue of binding and activation of antithrombin III by the sulfonic acid residues on the surface-immobilized Cibacron blue. Finally, such surfaces, especially when bearing bound albumin, diminish the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a pathogen frequently associated with device-centered infections. We conclude that similar albumin-affinity surfaces may hold promise for the development of more biocompatible materials for implantation and blood contact applications.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EXPTL PATHOL, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA; MEDTRONIC INC, MINNEAPOLIS, MN USA",,,,,,,,37,54,56,0,11,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

In order to better understand how the bioavailability of these HBGFs can take part in the regulation of the wound healing processes, we have studied the healing effect of various chemically substituted dextrans (CMDBS) selected for their affinity for HBGFs, alone and in association with HBGFs. The CMDBS was obtained by substitution of methylcarboxylic (CM), benzylamide (B) and benzylamine sulfonate (S) groups in proportion of 83%, 23% and 13% respectively for CMDBS K that we have further used (Mauzac et al., 1985 Biomaterials. 6: 61-63). CMDBS K could 1: potentiate the biological activity of 1 or 2 FGFs, 2: protect 1 and 2 FGFs against thermal or pH inactivation, 3: protect a and b FGFs against proteolytic degradation (Tardieu et al., 1992 J. Cell. Physiol. 150: 194-203). CMDBS K was tested alone in cutaneous and bone wound healing models and for its ability to stabilize FGFs. Rats were punched and skin regeneration was studied by morphometric and histological analysis. The wounds (6 mm diameter) were filled with collagen plaster alone or soaked with CMDBS. CMDBS K in collagen plaster was able to induce a remarkable effect both on the kinetics and on the quality of the restored skirt. These results suggest that endogenous growth factors naturally released during the regeneration process could be trapped, protected and released by CMDBS. Taking note of the ubiquitous distribution of FGFs and their ability to stimulate a wide range of target cells, we have looked at the effect of CMDBS K in a calvarian bone defect healing. Adult rats were trephined (3 mm diameter) and healing of their defects were studied after 21 days. Only those treated with CMDBS show significant new bone formation and filling of defects. In conclusion, biopolymers could be designed to mimic some of the mechanisms regulating the bioavailability of growth factors and hence be used as wound healing agents.","UNIV PARIS 12,CRRET,ETUD CROISSANCE REPARAT TISSULAIRE LAB,F-94010 CRETEIL,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 13,RECH MACROMOLEC LAB,VILLETANEUSE,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 05,PHYSIOPATHOL OSSEUSE LAB,MONTROUGE,FRANCE",,,"Meddahi-Pelle, Anne/B-7821-2013",,,,,10,37,38,0,7,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0344-0338,,,PATHOL RES PRACT,Pathol.

Two tanning protocols were used for the membranes, a new one involving microwaving and glutaraldehyde treatment (NEWGA), and the other, a conventional method using glutaraldehyde treatment at room temperature (OLDGA). Untreated membranes (NONGA) were also implanted. Sections of the implants were examined by light microscopy and with the confocal laser scanning microscope focusing on neovascularization and incorporation of the implant. At 64 days, the smooth sides of NEWGA and OLDGA implants were not well incorporated, with scarring subjacent to the surface and dystrophic calcification of that side of the membrane. At the same time, the rough sides of the NEWGA and OLDGA were not calcified with a giant cell reaction around the porcine collagen. The best incorporation was found in the NONGA membranes with no dystrophic calcification, excellent neovascularization of all layers, and complete remodeling at day 64. After 5 months, the completely remodeled NONGA membrane still could be identified, and the NEWGA and OLDGA membranes were calcified with a giant cell reaction having a dense fibrous capsule. It is concluded that if cross-linking is deemed necessary, the microwave cross-linking method is advisable because in the early stages there is less reactive inflammation around it, and the implant surfaces should be rough with an open structure, making calcification of crosslinked collagen unlikely.

Ellipsometry experiments of the simultaneous adsorption of HSA and either IgG or fibrinogen revealed a preferential adsorption of the latter proteins. This is seen not only from the total adsorbed amount, but also from the adsorbed layer thickness and from the buildup of the adsorbed layer. However, in sequential adsorption experiments, where HSA was first allowed to adsorb, followed by rinsing and addition of either IgG or fibrinogen, the additional adsorption is quite limited. Consequently, when HSA is allowed to adsorb on its own at hydrophobic surfaces, it is not removed by either IgG or fibrinogen to any larger extent. Furthermore, preadsorbed HSA was not exchanged by HSA added after adsorption and rinsing, implying that the mechanism behind this effect is an ''irreversible'' adsorption of HSA at hydrophobic surfaces, possibly originating from a surface-induced conformational change of HSA at these surfaces. Analogous findings were obtained with both methylated and HMDSO-treated surfaces, using both ellipsometry and TIRF.

Furthermore, 0.25 x 10(6) S. aureus were needed to induce a persistent specific inflammatory reaction with high concentrations of lymphocytes, i.e. mainly plasma-cells, at 3 weeks. The results indicate that this model functioned well to obtain the wanted information.

From immunologic studies it is known that inflammatory reactions can be modulated by use of (anti) growth factors or anti-inflammatory drugs. Before this can be employed the role of individual factors (humoral and cellular) involved in the inflammatory reaction against biomaterials has to be studied. In this part of the study the role of macrophages is studied with and without depletion by use of the liposomes-mediated macrophage suicide technique. Crosslinked dermal sheep collagens were used as biodegradable test materials. The results showed that macrophage depletion increases vascularization, and decreases the infiltration of granulocytess into the collagens. The foreign body reaction, i.e. the infiltration of macrophages and giant cells was significantly inhibited, resulting in a strongly delayed degradation time of the biomaterials. However, macrophage depletion did not inhibit attraction of fibroblasts and even resulted in increased formation of autologous rat-collagen, which improved the biocompatibility and the function of the biomaterials as a tempory scaffold.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,CELL BIOL & ELECTRON MICROSCOPY LAB,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,36,14,14,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine variations in the calcium concentration in the culture medium due to calcium release from the pretreated copolymers. Bone marrow cells were cultured on the copolymers for 2 and 3 weeks. Differences in formation rate and mineralization of bone nodules were analysed using LM and TEM techniques. Formation of bone nodules was observed after 2 weeks on non-treated copolymers. However,no mineralization in these bone nodules could be detected during the 3 weeks of this experiment. Addition of calcium ions to the copolymers initially increased the calcium concentration of the culture medium and led to formation of mineralized nodules after 2 weeks. The two precalcified copolymers had different effects on the calcium concentration of the culture medium. Instead of nodules, two or three continuous cell layers were formed and mineralization was observed after 2 weeks. Longer culture periods resulted in more mineralization in close contact with the copolymer surface. Based on the results of this experiment we conclude that the pre-operative addition of calcium ions or calcium phosphate to PEO/PBT copolymers stimulates mineralization in bone marrow cell cultures, which is an indication for better bone-bonding characteristics in vitro",,"GAILLARD, ML (reprint author), LEIDEN STATE UNIV,BIOMAT RES GRP,RIJNSBURGERWEG 10,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,"van Blitterswijk, Clemens/0000-0003-2371-4615",,,,33,5,5,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Human tissue adjacent to commercially pure titanium fracture fixation plates was obtained during routine removal of the plates after 1.5 years of implantation. Tissue samples of 20 patients were examined with both techniques. For monoclonal staining the following antibodies were used: HAM 56 (macrophages), propyl-4-hydroxylase (fibroblasts), CD 20 (B-lymphocytes), CD 2 (T-lymphocytes), CD 25 (activated T-lymphocytes), CD 4 (T-helper/inducer cells), CD 8 (T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells). For the visually controlled evaluation, we observed connective tissue cells (fibrocytes, fibroblasts) 709 +/- 19/mm(2) (mean +/- SEM per mm(2)), macrophages 4.0 +/- 0.9/mm(2) and lymphocytes 48.9 +/- 15/mm(2) With image analysis we found fibroblasts 223 +/- 23/mm(2), macrophages (HAM 56) 112 +/- 16/mm(2), T-lymphocytes (CD2) 100 +/- 10/mm(2), activated T-lymphocytes (CD 25) 49 +/- 6/mm(2). No B-lymphocytes were observed in the tissue samples. The results for macrophages (p = 0.0001) and lymphocytes (p = 0.0001) are statistically significantly higher using the image analysis. The antibody staining method in combination with an image analysis is to be recommended because of the time saved and the more precise identification of cells. Whenever no specific antibodies are available for the structure to be analysed, as in many animal studies, the visual method should be applied.","AO ASIF RES CTR DAVOS,CH-7270 DAVOS,SWITZERLAND; UNIV LIVERPOOL,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778",,,,10,1,1,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Macrophages are one of the cell types involved in both these responses. Initially macrophage infiltration is necessary to phagocytose cellular and other debris which result from implantation of a device. Wound healing can then follow. If, however, phagocytosis cannot be completed the macrophages may become highly activated resulting in a chronic inflammatory response. In this paper we examine the activation of human peritoneal macrophages, cultured on a range of materials, by transmitted and reflected light microscopy. The cells were stained for non-specific esterase (NSE), a macrophage marker and indicator of activation. The results showed that cells adhered to all materials tested, except for polyvinyl chloride. Polypropylene caused the greatest degree of macrophage activation, while hydroxyapatite and polytetrafluoroethylene caused the least activation. Macrophages cultured with metal phagocytosed some of the material. We conclude that this technique gives a good indication of the activated state of these cells and can be used in the assessment of the biocompatibility of materials with respect to the immune system.","ROYAL NATL ORTHOPAED HOSP,IRC BIOMED MAT,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND","MARTIN, M (reprint author), ROYAL NATL ORTHOPAED HOSP,INST ORTHOPAED,BROCKLEY HILL,STANMORE HA7 4LP,MIDDX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) underwent splenectomy or sham operation 7 days prior to the intraperitoneal implantation of rubber drain fragments (7 cm(2)). Bacterial translocation was measured 2 days after rubber drain implantation. The incidence of bacterial translocation was significantly higher in the group with intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation plus sham splenectomy than in the groups with sham splenectomy plus sham implantation, splenectomy plus sham implantation or splenectomy plus rubber drain implantation. An increase in ileal permeability of I-125-human serum albumin was induced by intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation and ameliorated by splenectomy. Splenectomy also improved the impaired intestinal motility induced by intraperitoneal rubber drain implantation. Histological examination revealed a preserved normal mucosal architecture in splenectomized rats. Thus, splenectomy reduced the rate of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal biomaterial implantation.

The black color of the resulting materials indicates the presence of polypyrrole while collagen was verified by amino acid analysis of the hybrids. Collagen incorporation into the hybrid was found to be a function of pyrrole concentration used in the polymerization. When the concentration of pyrrole was high, the collagen loading was low and vice versa. This inverse relationship was also found in the hybrids' electrical conductivity. A 26% collagen content in the hybrid gave a conductivity of 1.4 S cm-1 while a 4% collagen gave a higher value of 62.4 S cm-1. Thermogravimetric data suggest that the two polymers exist in the hybrid as a blend. The nature of the interaction of the components in the hybrid is believed to be strong since collagen could not be extracted despite denaturation with sodium dodecylsulfate.","NATL UNIV SINGAPORE,DEPT CHEM,SINGAPORE 0511,SINGAPORE",,,,,,,,38,12,13,0,3,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0959-8103,,,POLYM INT,Polym.

We have recently developed an in vitro test system to evaluate platelet/biomaterial interactions in whole blood. The system consists of a parallel plate flow cell and epifluorescent video microscopy (EVM). A glass coverslip coated with a polymer was incorporated into the flow cell, and blood was perfused using a syringe pump via a polymer-coated PVC tubing connected to the flow cell. Whole human blood was anticoagulated with heparin (2 U/ml), and the platelets were labeled with the fluorescent dye mepacrine (5 mu M). This system permitted real-time and dynamic observations of platelet/biomaterial interactions in whole blood under a defined flow condition. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this system, two different segmented polyether-poryurethanes (SPEUs), PU-PTMG(650) and PU-PTMG(2000), were chosen as test polymers. Surface characteristics verified with electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and contact angle measurements showed similar results in both SPEUs. Blood was perfused at a wall shear rate of 200 s(-1) for 20 min. Excitation light was applied for 2 s at 1 min intervals. The real-time image was then analyzed at each time point for the percentage of surface area of platelet coverage. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) levels were also measured before and after each run. PU-PTMG(650) showed a significantly higher number of adhered platelets than PU-PTMG(2000) at each time point. beta-TG levels of PU-PTMG(650) were also higher than those of PU-PTMG(2000), which is comparable to the results of EVM. Thus, this EVM system has been proven to be an excellent and highly sensitive in vitro analytical method for evaluating platelet/biomaterial interactions.","TERUMO CO LTD,CTR RES & DEV,INST BIOMED SCI,NAKAI,KANAGAWA 25901,JAPAN; WASEDA UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,TOKYO,JAPAN; TOKYO WOMENS MED COLL,TOKYO 162,JAPAN",,,,,,,,27,17,17,1,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

An effective approach for developing a clinically applicable biomaterial is to modify the surface of the material which already has excellent biofunctionality and bulk properties. This review article focuses on the surface modification of polymers by grafting techniques, which have long been known in polymer chemistry but are not yet widely applied to biomaterials. A grafted surface can be produced primarily either by graft polymerization of monomers or covalent coupling reaction of existing polymer molecules onto the substrate polymer surface. The major surface properties that should be modified include two kinds of biocompatibility. One is the surface property that elicits the least foreign-body reactions and the other is the cell- and tissue-bonding capability. In addition, physiologically active surfaces with, for instance, selective adsorbability may be required.

The effect of the extraction of lipids from the tissue employed in porcine valves is assessed in a model of subcutaneous implantation in rats. Tissue from aortic and pulmonary porcine valves was treated with chloroform-methanol and 0.625% glutaraldehyde and was implanted into young rats for periods of 21 and 60 d. The calcium accumulated was then quantified by atomic absorption. The effectiveness of this treatment is demonstrated by the detection of much lower calcium values than in the control group. For aortic valve tissue, the values obtained were 40.5 and 188.1 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight of tissue for implantation times of 21 and 60 d, respectively, versus 5.48 and 1.4 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight of tissue for the same tissue treated with chloroform-methanol, ihe values obtained with pulmonary valve tissue were very similar: 72.46 and 108.06 mu gCa(2+)/mg dry weight tissue versus 0.67 and 0.80 mu Ca2+/mg dry weight tissue for implantation periods of 21 and 60 d, respectively.

Cells which trafficked to the matrix blocks were recovered and characterized for surface phenotype using iluorescently labelled antibodies and flow cytometry (fluorescence activated cell sorting). Temporal information of the differential recruitment of cells was determined. The basic pattern of recruitment in response to the hydrogels was established and mimicked that seen in a local inflammatory response. Neutrophils (PMN) were rapidly recruited (1 d) followed by macrophages and lymphocytes (1-3 d). Cell surface phenotype studies included the determination of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, Mac-1(+) cells, and immunoglobulin bearing cells. Microscopic analysis revealed numerous activated PMNs and monocyte derived foamy macrophages. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry of frozen sections of the block revealed that macrophages, CD3(+) and natural killer tells were all recruited to the interior of the block. Ultrastructural analysis (transmission electron microscopy) showed highly activated macrophages, with abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles. Cells which remained on the surface of the matrix block were CD44 positive migratory cells. Electron microscopic evidence showed foamy macrophages with a varying degree of involvement with the hydrogel material. Surface scanning electron microscopy revealed numerous fibroblast-like cells coating the surface of the block. We suggest that these methods may be used to address the inflammatory response elicited with a variety of implanted materials such as hydrogels, silicones, ceramics and metals. Furthermore, this model has been useful in determining cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors under similar conditions.","USN,MED RES INST,WOUND REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM,BETHESDA,MD 20889","SPARGO, BJ (reprint author), USN,RES LAB,CTR BIOMOLEC SCI & ENGN,CODE 6900,WASHINGTON,DC 20375, USA.",,,,,,,14,19,20,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,AUG,1994.0,15,10,,,,,853,858,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90042-6,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,PC347,WOS:A1994PC34700019,7986951.0,,,,2019-02-25

In the present paper we show that vitrification is indeed necessary. However, dextran, which exists as a glass at a higher temperature than does trehalose and thus might be expected to stabilize liposomes more effectively, preserves DPPC liposomes only when extremely large quantities of the dextran are added. Dextran does not stabilize egg PC liposomes and, in fact, inhibits the stabilizing effects of trehalose. Dextran also does not depress T(m)in the dry phospholipids and shows no interaction with the polar headgroup, as assessed by infrared spectroscopy. Trehalose, by contrast, depresses T(m)in dry egg PC by about 60 degrees C and depresses vibrational frequency of the phosphate in the polar headgroup to the frequency seen in the hydrated lipid, an effect we ascribe to hydrogen bonding between the sugar and the polar headgroup. We conclude that while vitrification may be required it is not in itself sufficient to preserve freeze-dried liposomes.

Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes and the liver was observed in animals from groups 2 and 3, but significantly increased in group 4 with a concomitant elevation of serum levels of TNF and IL-6, as compared with group 1. Histological examination revealed a more pronounced inflammatory reaction in the peritoneum and distal ileum in group 3 than in groups 2 and 3.

The resulting polymers had weight average molecular weights ranging from 120,000-450,000, and their chemical structure was confirmed by elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The polycarbonates were evaluated as degradable biomaterials. Their surface properties were determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and contact angle measurement. The degree of surface hydrophobicity was related to the length of the alkyl ester pendent chain. The tensile properties were dependent on the chemical structure of the polymers: For thin, solvent cast film specimens, the tensile modulus varied from 1.2-1.6 GPa, and the strength at break from 60-220 MPa. The degradation of polymeric films was followed in vitro by measuring changes in mechanical strength for up to 40 weeks, and the decrease in molecular weight and changes in surface chemistry for up to 80 weeks. The length of the pendent chain affected the degradation behavior and strength retention; the polymers with short pendent chains were more readily hydrolyzable. For sterilization, ethylene oxide treatment was less destructive, as judged by molecular weight retention, than gamma-irradiation. Spin-cast films of all tested polycarbonates were not cytotoxic toward cultured rat lung fibroblasts. The cell response was influenced by the chemical structure of the polymer. The least hydrophobic polycarbonate (having a short ethyl ester pendent chain) was a more stimulating substrate for cell growth than the more hydrophobic polymers (carrying longer alkyl ester pendent chains).

Where relative toxicity is important, cytotoxicity testing is an effective way of further ranking the potential products. Though cytotoxicity cannot be used to predict precisely in vivo toxicity, used in this fashion it can be successfully incorporated into the selection procedures of a product research and development programme. Four applications of cytotoxicity testing in an industrial research environment will be discussed. Primary screening of metal complexes for potential antitumour activity by evaluating selective cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumour-derived cell lines. The cytotoxicity of a class of novel gold-phosphine complexes with antibacterial activity was assessed against the CHO cell line in order to select compounds with a favourable in vitro therapeutic index.

This has taken the form of many different assessment criteria, some even attempting some form of 'quantitative' grading index. With the complexity of this response and the availability of high performance computer systems it is not sufficient and no longer necessary to describe a tissue response subjectively. The soft tissue response to a number of implanted materials has been analysed using a combination of immunohistochemistry and image analysis to reproducibly stain and count the cells involved in a soft tissue response to implanted materials, as well as measure their position relative to the implanted material. The combination of cell count and pattern of cell distribution revealed that although the magnitude of the cellular responses changes with respect to time the position of cells with respect to an implanted material does not change significantly over time. The position of cells is controlled more by the type of implant material and the change in subject the material is implanted in.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT STAT & COMPUTAT MATH,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND","HUNT, JA (reprint author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT CLIN ENGN,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,"Hunt, John/G-6366-2012","Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778; Abrams, Keith/0000-0002-7557-1567",,,,10,23,24,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER, BAY 15, SHANNON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE CO, CLARE, IRELAND",0921-8912,,,ANAL CELL PATHOL,Anal.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether phagocytosable particles of hydroxyapatite had an adverse effect on bone ingrowth. Bone harvest chambers were implanted bilaterally in the proximal tibial metaphyses of 13 mature rabbits. The bone harvest chamber has a transverse 1-mm wide pore, providing a continuous canal through the chamber for tissue ingrowth. After an initial 6-week period for osseointegration of the bone harvest chambers, the contents of the canal were harvested at 3- or 6-week intervals. Hydroxyapatite particles (diameter, 5 mu) were mixed with a carrier solution, 1% sodium hyaluronate, and implanted in the canal of one chamber in each animal. The contralateral chamber was implanted with the carrier only and served as a control. Histological sections from the tissue harvested from the chambers were evaluated by light microscopy and histomorphometry, and the area of bone ingrowth was measured as a percentage of total area in each section. At 3 weeks there was more bone in the hydroxyapatite sections than in controls; at 6 weeks there was no difference. Hydroxypapatite particles were incorporated within the matrix of new ingrown bone at both time periods. There was no evidence of granuloma formation or inflammation. Previous studies have shown that particles of high density polyethylene and bone cement adversely affect bone ingrowth in this model.

The purpose of this study was to correlate the size and the orientation of image disturbances observed on specific samples of dental materials with their magnetic susceptibility. The measurement of the magnetic susceptibility was performed in the 10(-5) or 10(-6) range using MRI to establish a classification of dental materials. Methods. Cylindrical dental alloy samples incorporating gold, silver, and palladium were placed in a Pyrex beaker filled with distilled water. Images were performed at 0.13 Tesla using two-dimensional Fourier transformation and projection reconstruction at 360 degrees imaging methods. The magnetic susceptibilities were obtained by measuring distances between spots having the highest intensity on the image. Results. Avery discriminating classification may be established on MRI criteria. This method permits one to determine the dia- or para-magnetic character of the dental materials tested. Only palladium-based alloys have been detected to be paramagnetic with kappa > 0. One of the silver-based alloys did not induce detectable distortion because its susceptibility was very close to that of distilled water. Based on this MRI data, the use of this material may be recommended for applications that may be subjected to MRI evaluation. Significance. With the increasing use of MRI as a diagnostic tool, it is useful to establish a classification of prosthetic biomaterials compatible with MRI.","UNIV LYON 1,LAB RMN,F-69372 LYON 08,FRANCE","BEUF, O (reprint author), UNIV LYON 1,FAC ODONTOL,ETUD SURFACES & INTERFACES ODONTOL LAB,RUE GUILLAUME PARADIN,F-69372 LYON 08,FRANCE.",,"BEUF, Olivier/H-6966-2014",,,,,11,17,18,2,2,ACAD DENTAL MATERIALS,DALLAS,"BAYLOR COLLEGE DENTISTRY, 3302 GASTON AVE, DALLAS, TX 75266-0677",0109-5641,,,DENT MATER,Dent.

Antibody-treated platelets were added to microtiter wells coated with fibronectin, fibrinogen, vWF, IgG, vitronectin, albumin, or platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Cr-51-labeled platelet adhesion to matrix proteins was expressed as a percentage of that measured on PPP-coated surface. Platelets adhered to fibrinogen, fibronectin, vWF, or IgG immobilized on polystyrene. Limited binding to either vitronectin or albumin was detected. Binding to fibrinogen and IgG was blocked by mAb 10E5. Binding to IgG was also blocked by mAb IV.3. Binding to fibronectin, reduced in the presence of mAb 10E5, mAb BIIG4, or the polyclonal antiserum A108 alone, was further reduced by combined 10E5 and BIIG4 or 10E5 and A108. Neither mAb 10E5 nor 6D1 alone blocked adhesion to vWF; however, the combination of 10E5 and 6D1 significantly reduced platelet adhesion to this matrix, Finally, platelet adhesion to the plasma-coated surface was reduced by mAbs 10E5 and BIIG4. These results indicate that multiple adhesion receptors can mediate platelet adhesion to matrix proteins immobilized on surfaces.

New hard tissue is formed directly on the hydroxyapatite, whereas a characteristic necrotic area appears under Ca(OH)(2). The differing pulpal reactions to these two capping agents suggest differing cell responses. After isolation and selection of human pulp fibroblasts in vitro, the cells were characterized by their morphology, their high alkaline phosphatase specific activity, and their synthesis of type I and III collagens and fibronectin. They were then incubated in the presence of either hydroxyapatite (1 mg/ml) or Ca(OH)(2) (0.8 mg/ml). With Ca(OH)(2), the cells exhibited dramatical alterations in morphology, DNA synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity and protein synthesis, in accordance with the necrosis observed in vivo. With hydroxyapatite, phagocytic activity of pulpal fibroblasts toward hydroxyapatite particles (<10 mu m) was seen. As a consequence, DNA synthesis was affected. This inhibitory effect was not due to cell damage, as demonstrated by increased [H-3]-proline and [H-3]-leucine incorporation by the cells. There was also an inhibitory effect of hydroxyapatite on alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that the pulp fibroblasts were not in a differentiation stage. In conclusion, compared to the effects of Ca(OH)(2) on human pulp fibroblasts, these data are consistent with the biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite previously described in vivo and testify to the occurrence of a biological response elicited by this synthetic biomaterial.","INST BIOL,INSERM,CJF 9011,F-44035 NANTES,FRANCE","ALLIOTLICHT, B (reprint author), FAC CHIRURG DENT,PL A RICORDEAU,F-44035 NANTES,FRANCE.",,"GREGOIRE, Marc/G-2867-2013","GREGOIRE, Marc/0000-0003-3868-0198",,,,48,25,29,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0003-9969,,,ARCH ORAL BIOL,Arch.

All of these surfaces were covered with their respective oxides formed upon exposure of the metals to air. Quantitative analysis of the number of cells bound per unit area indicates that S. epidermidis (RP12) exhibits greatest adhesion to pure V surfaces. When exposed to surfaces having controlled spatial variations in chemical composition on the 10 mu m scale (microfabricated samples), the bacteria preferentially populate V islands versus Ti or Al substrata. In the case of the biphasic Ti6Al4V alloy, the bacteria tend to adhere to V-rich, mixed phase regions and phase boundaries. These findings demonstrate that enhanced and preferential adhesion of S. epidermidis (RP12) occurs on V surfaces in TI-Al-V metal systems and suggest that bacterial interactions are influenced by surface oxide composition.","MED SCI RES INST,HERNDON,VA 22071; JAMES MADISON UNIV,HARRISONBURG,VA 22801; CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL,S-41296 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN",,,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [AR26957]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM35939],,,31,19,20,1,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUN,1994.0,15,8,,,,,628,634,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90214-3,,,,7,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,NV145,WOS:A1994NV14500010,7948583.0,,,,2019-02-25

The respective biomaterials were positioned in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber, and exposed to flowing blood for 5 min at wall shear rates characteristic for veins (100/s), medium sized (650/s) and moderately stenosed arteries (2600/s). Blood-material interactions were morphologically quantified as platelet-surface adhesion, thrombus volume and fibrin deposition. Platelet adhesion to Dacron was highest at the lowest shear rate (13%) and decreased with increasing shear (4% at 2600/s). In contrast, platelet adhesion to PTFE was shear rate independent (17-19%), and significantly higher than the adhesion to Dacron at 2600/s (P< 0.05). A hallmark of the platelets adherent to PTFE and Dacron was the large percentage of platelets not spread out on the surface. This indicates that both materials were poor platelet activators, even though immunostaining demonstrated the adsorption of the platelet adhesive proteins von Willebrand factor and fibronectin. Adsorption of fibrinogen was also prevailing on both materials. Virtually no thrombi formed on Dacron, while a few small platelet thrombi were observed on PTFE. Less than 1 % of the Dacron and PTFE surfaces were covered by fibrin, irrespective of the shear rate. Thus, Dacron and PTFE interact differently with flowing non-anticoagulated human blood, and Dacron is apparently the least thrombogenic material.","NYCOMED BIOREG AS,UNIV OSLO,N-0317 OSLO,NORWAY",,,,,,,,31,32,36,1,6,RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH",0957-5235,,,BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN,Blood Coagul.

One of the potential difficulties with absorbable implants is the possible toxicity of the polymeric degradation products especially if they accumulate and become concentrated. Accordingly, material evaluation must involve dose-response toxicity data as well as mechanical properties and degradation rates. In this study the toxicity and rates of degradation for six polymers were determined, along with the toxicity of their degradation product components. The polymers studied were poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), two samples of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) having different molecular weights, poly(ortho ester) (POE), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(hydroxy butyrate valerate) (5% valerate) (PHBV). Polymeric specimens were incubated at 37-degrees-C in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 37-degrees-C) and sterile deionized water. The solutions were not changed during the incubation intervals, providing a worst-case model of the effects of accumulation of degradation products. The pH and acute toxicity of the incubation solutions and the mass loss and logarithmic viscosity number of the polymer samples were measured at 10 days, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Toxicity was measured using a bioluminescent bacteria, acute toxicity assay system. The acute toxicity of pure PGA, PLA, POE, and PCL degradation product components was also determined. Degradation products for PHBV were not tested. PGA incubation solutions were toxic at 10 days and at all following intervals. The lower molecular weight PLA incubation solutions were not toxic in buffer but were toxic by 4 weeks in water. The other materials did not produce toxic responses during the 16-week exposures. The degradation products components in order from most toxic to least toxic are: lactic acid (PLA), epsilon-caproic acid (PCL), glycolic acid (PGA), cyclohexane dimethanol (POE), propionic acid (POE), 1,6 hexane diol (POE), pentaerythritol dipropionate (POE), and pentaerythritol (POE).

Albumin molecules were functionalized by introducing double bonds using glycidyl acrylate. The functionalized albumin was covalently attached to various biomaterial surfaces such as polypropylene, polycarbonate, and poly(vinyl chloride) by gamma-irradiation. Surface-induced platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on the albumin-grafted surfaces was examined using computer-enhanced video microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The amount of the grafted albumin was dependent on the gamma-irradiation dose and the concentration of albumin used for adsorption. The grafted albumin molecules remained on the surface even after exposure to blood for prolonged time periods. This approach was used to graft albumin to polymeric materials of an oxygenator. The albumin grafting resulted in a substantial improvement in blood compatibility as compared to control oxygenators. The covalent grafting of functionalized albumin by gamma-irradiation obviates the need for premodification of chemically inert polymer surfaces. It is useful for albumin grafting to various biomaterial surfaces.

The efficacy of a lubricated cystoscope was evaluated by an in vivo test simulating cystoscope operation. The maximal and the total resistance force on the cystoscope model were found to decrease with the surface lubrication. Histological study revealed that urethral damage caused by rubbing with the cystoscope model was reduced by this lubrication technique.

A four-step detergent and enzymatic extraction process has been developed to remove cellular components from bovine pericardial tissue. The process results in an acellular matrix material consisting primarily of elastin, insoluble collagen, and tightly bound glycosaminoglycans. Light and electron microscopy confirmed that nearly all cellular constituents are removed without ultrastructural evidence of damage to fibrous components. Collagen denaturation temperatures remained unaltered. Biochemical analysis confirmed the retention of collagen and elastin and some differential extraction of glycosaminoglycans. Low strain rate fracture testing and high strain rate viscoelastic characterization showed that, with the exception of slightly increased stress relaxation, the mechanical properties of the fresh tissue were preserved in the pericardial acellular matrix. Crosslinking of the material in glutaraldehyde or poly(glycidyl ether) produced mechanical changes consistent with the same treatments of fresh tissue. The pericardial acellular matrix is a promising approach to the production of biomaterials for heart valve or cardiovascular patching applications.

In the first step the films were made hydrophobic by exposure to a tetrafluoromethane plasma. In the second step hydrophilicity was gradually increased by exposure to an argon plasma. XPS analysis of these films demonstrated that the first step resulted in the incorporation of fluor into the film surface (approximately 50 At.-%). In the second step fluor was almost completely removed from the surface, while the surface oxygen concentration increased from 5 to 20 At.-%. The wettability of the modified films, as characterized by water contact angle measurements, increased as a function of the argon treatment time. The advancing/receding contact angles (Wilhelmy plate method) decreased from 128/83 to 50/2 degrees respectively. In vitro adhesion of granulocytes and lymphocytes to the modified surfaces was studied under static conditions as a function of time. For both types of leukocytes it was found that the number of cells which adhered to the surface within a certain incubation time increased when the surface became more hydrophilic. The number of adherent granulocytes was about 2-3 times higher than the number of adherent lymphocytes. The number of adherent cells which could be predicted from the relationship between leukocyte adhesion and the wettability of the substrates within the series of homologous surfaces corresponded with the number of adherent cells to control surfaces (untreated polyurethane and Teflon).

Stabilization of collagen was performed with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde at acid pH, in the absence or presence of 0.7 M NaCl to control collagen swelling. For each condition, some samples were further treated at neutral pH. These test samples were compared with samples treated with glutaraldehyde at neutral pH and with samples of Omni-flow vascular prosthesis. The effectiveness of the stabilization was examined by amino acid analysis, to assess the extent of modification, isometric tension analysis, to evaluate the extent of crosslinking, compliance and accelerated fatigue testing, to evaluate mechanical properties, and by a rat subcutaneous model to evaluate tissue response and propensity to calcification. The data indicated that effective crosslinking could be achieved at low pH and that this can be increased slightly by the presence of NaCl. At low pH, the extent of calcification was low compared to samples treated at pH 7. Subsequent treatment at pH 7 of samples given an initial low pH glutaraldehyde (GA) treatment generally did not alter shrinkage temperatures although the extent of lysine modification and calcification did increase. In general, a more inflammatory response was observed in samples tanned at low pH, although this was not as severe as responses to untreated tissue implants.

To visualize the cell layer on opaque surfaces, a fluorescent staining method has been developed. The measurements show statistically significant differences between material classes, with the highest degree of adhesion about twice that of the lowest degree of adhesion. The greatest adhesion was observed with metallic materials which exhibit a shear stress to erode cells from the material surface of about 5.65 x 10(-3) N cm(-2). The tensile stress of adhesion (about 2.15 x 10(-2) N cm(-2)) was similar for most materials. The interpretation of the results of jet impingement testing and their relation to in vivo cell and soft tissue adherence to biomaterials merits further investigation.","AO,RES INST,DAVOS,SWITZERLAND","BUNDY, KJ (reprint author), TULANE UNIV,SCH ENGN,NEW ORLEANS,LA, USA.",,"O'Connor, Kim/H-3145-2012",,,,,6,6,6,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

When combined with a biocompatible liquid medium, the material easily flowed through small-gauge needles. When injected beneath the facial skin in rats, a profound macrophage response was initially seen at 30 days accompanied by fibroblast proliferation and new collagen formation. By 1 year, a quescient, noninflammatory cellular response with extensive intermaterial collagen deposition was evident. No adverse reactions were seen in the contralateral facial sites, which were injected with only the liquid medium. These preliminary findings suggest good tissue compatibility of this composite biomaterial and provide further evidence of the significant regulatory role of the macrophage in the tissue response to implanted biomaterials.","INDIANA UNIV,DEPT ORAL PATHOL,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202","EPPLEY, BL (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,MED CTR,DIV PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,702 BARNHILL DR,ROOM 2514,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202, USA.",,,,,,,22,13,13,0,1,LITTLE BROWN CO,BOSTON,"34 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, MA 02108-1493",0148-7043,,,ANN PLAS SURG,Ann.

However, the survival rate of patients with acute hepatic failure remains at approximately 30% and has not improved as expected. Current advances in biotechnology have opened the way for the development of a biological artificial liver, which is called the hybrid artificial liver because it consists of both biological and artificial materials. Isolated hepatocytes have been investigated for use in various types of hybrid artificial liver. In addition, the role of biomatrices, microcarriers, and the microencapsulation technique has been studied with respect to long-term maintenance of hepatocellular function and development of high-density culture systems for hepatocytes. Before clinical application of hybrid artificial liver support systems becomes possible, many problems have to be resolved, including large-scale preparation and long-term preservation of biomaterials, high-density and stable immobilization of biomaterials on artificial materials, control of immunological hazards, biocompatibility, safe transportation and sterilization of biomaterials, and the high cost.

The beta-sheet structure is stable at very low concentrations in water and at high temperatures. Various pH changes at 1.5, 3, 7, and 11 had little effect on the stability of the beta-sheet structure. The beta-sheet structure was not altered significantly even in the presence of 0.1% SDS, 7 molar guanidine hydrochloride, or 8 molar urea. One of the structural characteristics of the EAK16 is its ionic self-complementarity in that ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds between Glu and Lys can form readily between two oligopeptide beta-sheet structures. This structural feature is probably one of the factors that promotes its extreme stability. This is the first example of such an extended ionic self-complementarity in a protein structure. EAK16 and its related peptides may have applications as useful biomaterials. It also offers a good model for studying the mechanism of beta-sheet formation. Because the oligopeptide can self-assemble to form a membranous structure, it may have relevance to origin of life research.

Of particular interest is the study monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the implanted cages containing biomaterials, as macrophages may initiate a wide spectrum of responses upon interaction with a foreign material. In this study, the authors propose a technique using subcutaneous tissue cages in conjunction with cytofluorimetric analysis of exudate leukocytes to evaluate the monocyte/macrophage cell activation in response to different materials. The studies reported here used several materials (thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers) as the challenging agent, to demonstrate whether polymers, chemically different from each other, could differentially activate macrophages to carry out their proinflammatory role more effectively. The materials tested included: poly(etherurethane ureas) (PEUU A'), poly(etherurethane ureas) with a surface active additive, Methacrol(R), (PEUU C'), polymethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyetherimide, (PEI), and polyetheretherketone, (PEEK). For all the tested materials, the maximum numbers of exudate cells and of Ia-positive macrophages were found on day 7, although the entity of the cell increase was associated with the material used for the implant. Similarly, the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages varied according to the specific polymer present in the cages after 7 days. By day 14 the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages decreased with individual exudates showing 19-32% Ia-positive cells depending on the different type of material. Only in the case of PDMS did the percentage of Ia-positive macrophages remain the same as compared with control empty cage macrophages.

This study investigated the role of the host protein fibronectin in promoting adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis to metallic surfaces representing materials used for orthopaedic devices. Pure human fibronectin was adsorbed in vitro onto coverslips (0.8 x 0.8 cm) of stainless steel, pure titanium, or titanium-aluminum-niobium alloy. In vitro bacterial adhesion was promoted more strongly by the metallic surfaces coated with fibronectin than by albumin-coated controls for two strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis. Furthermore, with the fibronectin-coated coverslips, bacterial adhesion to titanium alloy was significantly greater than adhesion to stainless steel. Adhesion of the three staphylococcal strains was promoted more strongly by coverslips explanted from the subcutaneous space of guinea pins and tested under similar conditions than by albumin-coated controls. Incubation of either in vitro fibronectin-coated or explanted metallic coverslips with anti-fibronectin antibodies produced a significant decrease in staphylococcal adhesion. These results suggest that the presence of fibronectin on the surface of implanted metallic devices is an important determinant of colonization of orthopaedic biomaterials by staphylococci.","UNIV HOSP GENEVA,DEPT MED,DIV INFECT DIS,CH-1211 GENEVA 14,SWITZERLAND; UNIV HOSP GENEVA,DEPT SURG,ORTHOPAED CLIN,GENEVA,SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,22,49,49,0,5,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Angle-dependent x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements indicated that EDS was immobilized on glass as a fractional hydrophilic monolayer, and ODDMS and DMS were bound as patchy amorphous hydrophobic multilayers. Neither surface coverage nor thickness of the overlayer seemed to be as important as surface chemistry, or charge, in guiding mammalian cell distribution. These results are consistent with the concept that mammalian cells attach to and are guided by positively charged surfaces.

In this study the function of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) crosslinked with carbodiimide (ENDSC) as repair material for abdominal wall defects in rats was compared with that of commercial hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked HDSC. The results indicate that early after implantation both ENDSC and HDSC functioned well as a matrix for cellular ingrowth. However during further implantation HDSC soon degraded resulting in herniations, while ENDSC showed a delay in the degradation time of at least 20 weeks. ENDSC thereby enabled collagen new-formation and functioned as a guidance for muscle overgrowth.

In this work, the adsorption of plasminogen to silylated silica glass materials has been investigated with the objective of providing data for the development of a profibrinolytic or clot lysing surface for blood-contacting applications. The adsorption of plasminogen from Tris buffer to silica glass, lysine modified silica glass, and its sulfonated silica glass precursor has been investigated. The isotherms (25-degrees-C) suggest high affinity, Langmuir type adsorption. Adsorption capacities are in the order sulfonated silica > lysinized silica > unmodified silica. Estimates of the apparent affinity constants based on the Langmuir equation indicate that the affinity of plasminogen is greater for the lysinized surface than for either the silica glass or sulfonated silica glass. Experiments on the adsorption of plasminogen to the sulfonated and lysinized silica glass in the presence of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), known to interfere with plasminogen binding to lysine, were also carried out. Adsorption plateau values for the sulfonated surface with and without EACA in the buffer were the same. For the lysinized surface, adsorption was reduced in the presence of EACA. Desorption experiments against Tris buffer showed that for the lysinized and sulfonated surfaces, 70-80% of the protein was irreversibly bound, with slightly higher reversibility on the lysinized surface. It is concluded that the mechanisms of adsorption of plasminogen to the lysinized surface and sulfonated surface are different, and that the lysine binding sites of plasminogen may be utilized in its interactions with the lysinized surface.

Light of visible blue wavelengths, 400-500 nm, has been applied at normal angles to 0.2-5.0 mm sections of human dentine and representative ceramic, polymer-ceramic composites and hybrid glass-.polyalkenoate materials. The integrated optical transmission has been determined for each material section. The data have been converted to absorbance values and analysed to check for mathematical conformity to the Beer-Lambert Law. It is found that conformity (typically, P < 0.01) to the linear Beer-Lambert Law is only attained by making a substantial correction for the intensity of light reflected from the surface of aesthetic biomaterials. This is otherwise expressed by distinguishing between true and apparent absorbance. From linear regression of apparent absorbance with section thickness, the intercept depends upon the logarithm of the surface-reflection ratio. This factor ranges from 30% to 90% in the materials investigated. It follows that there is a high degree of inefficency in the transmission of visible light into and through aesthetic biomaterials for the purposes of photoactivation using existing technology. Means by which this limitation and inefficiency may be reduced are discussed.

The silicone-containing elastomers studied included two thermoset amorphous silica reinforced dimethyl methylvinyl siloxane-based polymers which were extruded as Silastic(R) RX-50 Medical Grade Tubing (RX-50) and Silastic(R) Medical Grade Tubing H.P. (HP). They also included three experimental thermoplastic silicone-urea urethane copolymers received as X7-4074 (SP-1), X7-4037 (SP-2), and X7-4943 (SP-3). The RX-50 tubing material showed less thrombus deposition compared to the silicone-urea urethane copolymers. This suggests that the blood-contacting response of a silicone elastomer is strongly affected by the incorporation of the urea urethane segments. Among the silicone-urea urethane copolymers, the SP-3 material showed higher levels of platelet and fibrinogen deposition than the SP-1 and SP-2 materials, whereas the SP-1 and SP-2 samples had similar levels of deposition. These results indicate that the blood-contacting properties of the silicone-urea urethane copolymers were influenced more by the molecular weight of the polydimethylsiloxane than by the type of diol used in the urea urethane segments. The maximal platelet deposition on the poly(vinyl alcohol)-coated silicone was approximately an order of magnitude greater than those on the silicone-containing elastomers indicating that the PVA coating was more thrombogenic.","UNIV DELAWARE,COLL ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; DOW CORNING CORP,MIDLAND,MI 48686; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,"Lin, Jui-Che/C-8230-2012","Lin, Jui-Che/0000-0003-4436-655X",,,,16,0,0,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Bone repair in the drilled hole may be affected by bone damage attributed to drilling, thus influencing the bone response to biomaterials. The drilling parameters (the speed of rotation and irrigation) were investigated histologically. Three holes were drilled in each rabbit tibia with different conditions; three speeds (200, 500 and 5000 r.p.m.) and the use of central irrigation or not. Rabbits were killed immediately, 3 days, 2 weeks or 4 weeks post-operatively. India ink was injected in several rabbits just after drilling to investigate the extent of local ischaemia. The drilling quality was evaluated with regard to hole geometry, initial thermal damage and later bone healing process. For 500 or 200 r.p.m. the initial thermal damage, shown by the degree of ischaemia, was less than for 5000 r.p.m. drilling, but the hole edge was not always cleanly cut. This uneven cut edge was considered not to influence the bone-healing process. Drilling at 200 r.p.m. introduced a lower degree of circularity. The subsequent bone formation was retarded by 5000 r.p.m. drilling, presumably due to thermal damage and vascular obstructions, The irrigation was effective in reducing the ischaemic area. These results suggest that a speed of about 500 r.p.m. may be recommendable for intraosseous implantation of biomaterials. The central irrigation system is considered effective in reducing the ischaemic area.","UNIV PARIS 07,FAC MED LARIBOISIERE ST LOUIS,CNRS,UA 1432,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","OHASHI, H (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,10,10,0,6,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The implantation site is assumed to be one of the factors that influence the bone response to biomaterials. The aim of this study was to investigate the bone-healing process in drilled cortical defects at different sites with respect to time. Sheep metatarsus was implemented, since it is a long straight bone with four flat faces. Thus, the different drilling sites were obtained by changing the longitudinal level (proximal, middle and distal) and bone aspect (anterior, lateral and posterior). Metatarsi were obtained at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months post-operatively and with non-decalcified sections the newly formed bone area was measured using a microscope connected to an image analyser. The rate of bone formation was higher in the anterior aspect (P < 0.05). The new bone did not form concentrically from the hole edge towards the centre, and the principal direction of bone growth was different between the anterior and the posterior aspects (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference with respect to the longitudinal axis. These results indicate that the implantation site must be considered when analysing the bone response to biomaterials implanted in cortical defects.","UNIV PARIS 07,FAC MED LARIBOISIERE ST LOUIS,CNRS,UA 1432,RECH ORTHOPED LAB,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","OHASHI, H (reprint author), OSAKA CITY UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,1-5-7 ASAHIMACHI,ABENO KU,OSAKA 545,JAPAN.",,,,,,,8,1,1,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

In this study, the contact system, in which the activation of factor XII and plasma kallikrein is included, is highlighted. This article describes a simple chromogenic assay to determine the Hageman Factor fragment (HFf, or factor XIIf) and kallikrein activity invitro. The assay is based on conversion of Z-Lys-Phe-Arg-pNA.2HCl to which human factor XIIf and kallikrein appeared to have a high affinity. To discriminate between the serine proteases factor XIIf and kallikrein to cleave this substrate, aprotinin was added to one of two complementary samples. In this in vitro study, standardized disks from glass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polytetrafluoro ethylene (PTFE), and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) were studied for their capacity to generate factor XIIf and kallikrein in plasma. Kaolin was used as positive control. On glass disks the highest and on HDPE the lowest generation of factor XIIf and kallikrein were found, both with a ratio of 1:1. On PDMS and on PTFE disks protease activities were intermediate, but with a factor XIIf and kallikrein activity ratio of 1:2 and 1:4, respectively. Apparently because of the hydrophobic surface character of PDMS and PTFE, these surfaces absorb or fail to produce the factor XIIf. This assay appeared to be discriminative even for materials that are considered mild activators of the contact system and can therefore be used asa standard method to qualify biomaterials. NOTE: Factor XIIf (mel wt. 28,000) is designated in the literature as HFf, beta-factor XIIa, or factor XII(LMW) and factor XIIa (mel wt. 80,000) as HFa; factor XIIa(HMW) or alpha-factor XIIa. To avoid the unfashionable use of beta-factor XIIa or alpha-factor XIIa, we chose in this study the use of factor XIIf and factor XIIa, according to the article by R. A.

In vitro, the four DSC versions were found to be noncytotoxic or very low in cytoxicity. After subcutaneous implantation in rats, hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked DSC (HDSC) seldom induced an increased infiltration of neutrophils or macrophages, as compared with normal wound healing; whereas new formation of collagen was observed. DSC crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GDSC) followed by reaction with NaBH4 shortly after implantation showed an increased infiltration of neutrophils with a deviant morphology. Furthermore, a high incidence of calcification was observed, which may explain the minor ingrowth of giant cells and fibroblasts, and the poor formation of new rat collagen. Acyl azide-crosslinked DSC (AaDSC) first induced an increased infiltration of macrophages, and then of giant cells, both with high lipid formation. AaDSC degraded at least twice as slowly as HDSC and GDSC, finally leaving a matrix of newly formed rat collagen. Samples crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (ENDSC) induced the same mild cellular reaction as HDSC; whereas, similar to AaDSC, the degradation rate was slow and an-optimal rat collagen matrix was formed. Of the crosslinked DSC samples, ENDSC seems most promising for tissue regeneration.

White New Zealand rabbits received intraperitoneal implants of different biomaterials for repair of defects created on the abdominal wall. The following biomaterials were used: polypropylene, polyester, expanded polytetraflueroethylene, polypropylene mesh/polypropylene sheeting (polypropylene mesh covered with polypropylene sheeting on the peritoneal side), polypropylene/silastic, polypropylene/polyglactin, polypropylene/polyglycolic acid, and polypropylene/fibrin. All biomaterials evaluated caused adhesions to the intestines except for polypropylene mesh/polypropylene sheeting and polypropylene mesh/silastic composites. Because adhesion of the intestine to the biomaterial is the first stage of biomaterial-related intestinal fistula, its prevention is logical for the elimination of this complication.

Because neutrophils mediate host defense against infection, the effect of biomaterials on neutrophil superoxide release and the mechanism of that effect were investigated using three materials commonly employed in surgical practice. The graft materials were expanded polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyurethane and woven dacron. Polystyrene, a commonly used laboratory support vessel, was also studied. Both polystyrene and polyurethane were activating, but serum inhibitable, whereas PTFE was nonactivating, and woven dacron was not activating unless serum was present. The signaling mechanisms used by these materials demonstrated time and material dependency. Pertussis toxin inhibition of G protein-dependent activation had little or no effect on biomaterial induced activation, whereas FMLP-induced activation of the same biomaterial-associated cells was inhibited. Protein kinase C inhibition with staurosporine greatly inhibited polystyrene-induced activation, but had only a partial effect with polyurethane and even less effect with the activation associated with serum-treated woven dacron. These studies demonstrated that biomaterial contact-induced neutrophil activation differed from that described for cells in suspension, and showed that activation mechanisms on one material cannot be extrapolated to mechanisms on other materials.

The ion chemistry of macrolides, as determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), is different for ions produced as metallated than those formed as (M + H)+ species. An explanation for these differences is the location of the charge. For protonated species, the charge is most likely situated on a functional group with high proton affinity, such as the dimethylamino group of the amino sugar. The alkali metal ion, however, is bonded to the highly oxygenated aglycone. As a result, the collision-activated dissociation spectra of protonated macrolides are simple with readily identifiable fragment ions in both the high and low mass regions but no fragments in the middle mass range. In contrast, the cationized species give complex spectra with many abundant ions, most of which are located in the high mass range. The complementary nature of the fragmentation of these two species recommends the study of both by MS/MS when determining the structure or confirming the identity of these biomaterials.","UNIV NEBRASKA,MIDWEST CTR MASS SPECT,LINCOLN,NE 68588; SCHERING PLOUGH RES INST,KENILWORTH,NJ",,,,"MacMillan, Denise/0000-0002-8424-6651",,,,46,18,18,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",1044-0305,,,J AM SOC MASS SPECTR,J.

However, wider use has been limited in good part by economic factors, some of which are related to the line-of-sight nature of the beam implantation process. Plasma source implantation (or plasma immersion ion implantation) is intended to remove some of the limitations imposed by directionality of beam systems and also to help provide economies of scale. The present paper will outline relevant technologies and areas of expertise that exist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in relation to possible future needs in materials processing. Experience in generation of plasmas, control of ionization states, pulsed extraction, and sheath physics exist. Contributions to future technology can be made either for the immersion mode or for the extracted beam mode. Existing facilities include the High Power Test Facility, which could conservatively operate at 1 A of continuous current at 100 kV delivered to areas of about 1 m2. Higher instantaneous voltages and currents are available with a reduced duty cycle. Another facility, the High Heat Flux Facility can supply a maximum at 60 kV and currents of up to 60 A for 2 s on a 10% duty cycle. Plasmas may be generated by use of microwaves, radio-frequency induction, or other methods and plasma properties may be tailored to suit specific needs.

In both cases, sensitive and, even more important, selective analytical tools for the determination of individual components are mandatory. However, investigation of complex and often diffuse (bio)chemical systems requires a different analytical approach aimed at the detection of a wide range of compounds rather than a selective analysis of compounds. This requirement is especially true if no prior knowledge exists of the kind of compounds involved in the properties of such systems. The analysis of macromolecular systems or complex matrices consisting of chemical components with strongly diverging physico-chemical properties can often hardly be performed through separation and determination of individual components. Examples of such matrices are bioreactor mixtures, microorganisms, cells of biological origin, body fluids, plant tissues, raw materials for food production, food products, dietary fiber, soil, humic substances, and fossil deposits (1-5). Especially the macromolecular part of such samples contains compounds that are highly involatile, with molecular weights far beyond the mass range of mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometry requires ions in vacuum. This process involves formation of ions from volatile compounds (generally El and Cl processes, or desorption of ions into the gas phase, for example by field desorption (FD) (6, 7) or charged aerosol droplets (thermospray, electrospray, ion spray) for nonvolatile compounds (8). Compounds of medium volatility and relatively high thermostability, usually in the medium molecular weight range, can be analyzed with thermal desorption techniques, such as direct probe mass spectrometry (DP-MS) (3). Apparently, these techniques are not appropriate for direct mass spectrometric analyses of the intact high-molecular-weight and heat-labile compounds of the complex matrices described above. For such samples, thermal degradation techniques (pyrolysis) can be performed to generate more volatile compounds of lower molecular weight that are amenable to mass spectrometric analysis (analytical pyrolysis). Therefore, many analytical profiling methods of (bio)macromolecular matrices are based on analysis of thermally-degraded matrices. Generally, application of such degradation techniques results in mixtures of high complexity. Therefore, advanced analytical equipment is needed to analyze the mixtures generated. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) (4, 9-12), pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC), and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) (5, 13, 14) are the techniques most widely applied in the field of analytical pyrolysis. They offer a powerful approach in that a great variety of compounds can be measured in one analysis and usually limited sample preparations are required. Generally, only small amounts of sample (typically 10-200 mug) are needed (1-5). Important applications are fingerprinting for characterization and differentiation of polymers, biomaterials, and microorganisms using pattern recognition methods (4, 5, 15), and identification of individual compounds in pyrolysates for obtaining insight into the structure of the original (bio)macromolecules (3, 4, 16-18). In the fingerprinting approach, differentiation is frequently based on statistical evaluation rather than on chemical interpretation of differentiating components (15). However, in most applications of this kind, at least global indications are obtained of relevant chemical compounds on which differentiation is based. Comparison of the techniques most widely used in analyses of this type, Py-GC and Py-MS, shows that dedicated Py-MS equipment offers a number of potential advantages (4, 9, 19), such as a high sample throughput, the potential of handling compounds differing to a large extent in polarity and molecular weight (4, 12), the suitability of MS data to computer handling for data analyses, good reproducibility, and a better long-term stability. However, for the identification of a large number of individual compounds in pyrolysates, for example, extended series of isomeric or homologous compounds, Py-GC/MS (5), Py-GC/(HR)MS (14, 17), and Py-GC/MSMS (20) are the techniques of choice, as long as volatile compounds are encountered. Serious limitations are the condensation of nonvolatile, relatively high-molecular-weight, and polar compounds on the inner wall of the glass linear and column and the relatively long analysis times. Recent developments in pyrolysate analysis embrace the application of tandem mass spectrometry (Py-MSMS) (18, 21-25), Py-GC/MSMS (20), and (off-line Py) fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry (FAB/MSMS) (11). Py-MSMS is a powerful method for identifying molecular species directly in pyrolysates and has successfully been applied to the characterization of thermal decomposition products of polymers (21, 23), biopolymers (18, 24), bacteria (22), and algae (25). It is interesting to note that some recent reports show an apparent tendency to characterization of microorganisms using only well-defined chemical marker components (26, 27). The application of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical chromatography (SFC) to high-molecular-weight and polar compounds from pyrolysates has been reported recently (28, 29). In general, the approach requires off-line pyrolysis and pyrolysate derivatization preceding HPLC or SFC separation (29), but some initial results of on-line pyrolysis under SFC conditions with subsequent SFC analysis (Py-SFC) have been reported (28). Especially in SFC analysis of polar compounds, derivatization is required to reduce the polarity (30). Also, the direct monitoring of volatile compounds becomes increasingly important. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS), applying hollow-fiber capillary membranes or membrane sheets, in combination with (tandem) mass spectrometry has recently been developed for the monitoring of mixtures of relatively volatile organic compounds in aqueous solutions, for gas analysis, and for in vivo studies of the formation of low-molecular-weight compounds. These techniques are applied to monitor small molecules in fermentation broths (fermentor control), to study microbial physiology, and for in vivo analysis of blood gases (31, 32). Flow injection/membrane introduction devices have been applied to bioreactor monitoring (33). Because data acquired from (bio)chemical matrices are mostly very complex, data analysis techniques are necessary for an effective evaluation of the analytical output. Already in an early stage of direct mixture analysis, in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the first applications of data preprocessing and pattern recognition techniques were mentioned (4, 34). Data analysis techniques will be discussed in another section of this review. In this article, we will selectively review the use of direct mass spectrometric profiling for the analysis of complex (bio)chemical systems with an emphasis on applications in which pattern recognition techniques have been applied to the evaluation of the resulting profiles. Application of chromatographic separation techniques to mixture analysis is mentioned only occasionally in this review. The direct analysis of polymers by mass spectrometry has been reviewed separately in this journal (3) and, therefore, will not be discussed in this article.",,"TAS, AC (reprint author), TNO,NUTR & FOOD RES INST,POB 360,ZEIST,NETHERLANDS.",,"feng, andrew/F-8487-2014",,,,,148,10,10,3,51,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0277-7037,,,MASS SPECTROM REV,Mass Spectrom.

By applying this correction, we determine a set of values for stress-time which, when compared with those obtained with a non-sutured sample, reveal a significant fall in this ratio and, thus, a decrease in the durability.

Undecalcified sections were examined histologically at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 wk intervals. Resorbable materials (TCP and NC) were totally resorbed by 24 wk. DHA, PHA and HA showed very limited resorption, although there were multinucleated giant cells in contact with PHA and SPHA. There was no histologically detectable bone formation in contact with or near any of the biomaterials tested. However, several particles of NC, and sometimes of PHA, were surrounded by a dense, mineralized matrix.

In this study the contribution that serum fibronectin (Fn) or vitronectin (Vn) make to the attachment and spreading of cells cultured from explanted human bone (bone-derived cells) during the first 90 min of culture was determined for metallic and ceramic surfaces. The requirement for Fn or Vn for attachment and spreading of bone-derived cells onto stainless steel 316 (SS), titanium (Ti) and alumina (Al2O3) and to polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) was directly tested by selective removal of Fn or Vn from the serum prior to addition to the culture medium. Attachment and spreading of bone-derived cells onto SS, Ti and Al2O3 surfaces were reduced by 73-83% when the cells were seeded in medium containing serum from which the Vn had been removed. Cell attachment and spreading on these surfaces when seeded in medium containing Fn-depleted serum (which contained Vn) were not reduced to the same extent as in the medium containing Vn-depleted serum. The bone-derived cells failed to attach to the surfaces to the same extent when seeded in medium containing serum depleted of both Vn and Fn. Our results show that for human bone-derived cells, the attachment and spreading of cells onto SS, Ti and Al2O3 as well as PET during the first 90 min of a cell culture attachment assay are a function of adsorption of serum Vn onto the surface.","CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,SYDNEY LAB,N RYDE,NSW 2113,AUSTRALIA; BROWN UNIV,RHODE ISL HOSP,DEPT ORTHOPAED,PROVIDENCE,RI 02903","HOWLETT, CR (reprint author), UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PATHOL,POB 1,KENSINGTON,NSW 2033,AUSTRALIA.",,"Evans, Margaret/B-3261-2011","Evans, Margaret/0000-0003-3078-1576; Walsh, William/0000-0002-5023-6148",,,,50,136,137,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,1994.0,15,3,,,,,213,222,,10.1016/0142-9612(94)90070-1,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,MZ910,WOS:A1994MZ91000009,7515290.0,,,,2019-02-25

The nature of the blood response involving interactions of systems, pattern and extent of change, patient status and the influence of the whole device contribute to the complexity. Recognising these, the profile of the blood response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), with respect to type of device, mode of blood flow, duration of the procedure and patient status, has been evaluated by monitoring contact phase activation [Factor XII-like activity (FXIIA)], fibrinolytic activity [Fibrin degradation products (X-FDP's)], complement activation (C3a, C5a), leucocyte activation [Granulocyte elastase (GE)] and platelet and white cell imaging. FXIIA, X-FDP's, and GE rose gradually during CPB, with levels remaining elevated post-operatively for up to 48 h. In contrast, C3a levels rose sharply with no significant elevation in the post-operative period, while C5a did not show significant changes during bypass. The use of pulsatile perfusion resulted, in lesser activation of the parameters, although these were significantly less only for GE. The alterations in FXIIA, X-FDP's, C3a and GE correlated positively with the duration of CPB, with this effect pronounced in the post-operative period for FXIIA, X-FDP's and GE. However, these changes had no apparent influence on clinical outcome and the majority of patients had uncomplicated post-operative recoveries. With respect to the use of bubble/membrane oxygenators, platelet and white cell deposition and the patterns of change for FXIIA and C3a were similar in the two groups. The investigation has enabled a broad perspective of biocompatibility in CPB relevant to the clinical application of biomaterials.","UNIV STRATHCLYDE,WOLFSON CTR,BIOENGN UNIT,GLASGOW G4 0NW,LANARK,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT CARDIAC SURG,GLASGOW,SCOTLAND; UNIV GLASGOW,ROYAL INFIRM,DEPT MED,GLASGOW G31 2ER,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,26,17,17,0,3,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

The animals were sacrificed at 1, 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Undecalcified histologic sections were prepared, evaluated qualitatively, and quantified with the aid of an image analysis system. The percentage of bone contact was determined morphometrically for all PEO/PBT proportions; for the 70/30 ratio, the percentage of calcification of the material surface and of bone-bonding (defined as a continuum at the light microscopic level between calcification within the material surface and bone tissue) were also assessed. PEO/PBT copolymers possess hydrogelic properties, and a direct relation has been established between water-uptake and PEO content. The swelling behavior of all PEO/PBT substrates resulted in a high degree of bone contact (over 95%) at early stages. From the 12-week survival time onward the 70/30 revealed higher percentages of bone contact (over 80%) when compared with the other ratios (60/40, 55/45, 40/60, and 30/70). This difference was statistically confirmed 1 year postoperatively. The materials with the higher PEO contents showed the highest amounts of calcification, which is reflected by the rate of bone-bonding (70% of bone-bonding for the 70/30 at 52 weeks). Calcification and bone-bonding were not observed for 40/60 and 30/70 proportions. The quantitative results confirmed the relation between PEO content, water-uptake, calcification, and bone-bonding. It was furthermore demonstrated that PEO/PBT copolymers initially establish a high degree of bone contact, whereas the bone-bonding properties, especially of the 70/30, accomplish a long-term implant fixation.

Recently, we described an efficient cross-linking process via the formation of acyl azide groups on methylated carboxyl groups of collagen using hydrazine and nitrous acid (referred to here as the hydrazine method). In this report, we propose a simpler, faster way to prepare acyl azide groups and to cross-link collagen-based biomaterials, using diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) as a reagent. After determining the optimal conditions of cross-linking with DPPA, we compared the efficiency of this protocol with that using hydrazine and with the classical glutaraldehyde treatment. In order to validate and quantitate the extent of reaction, the degree of crosslinking was determined by the measure of the free primary amino group content of the samples. Treatment of native bovine pericardium with 0.5% DPPA for 24h led to efficient cross-linking, corresponding to a 50% decrease in the free primary amino group content of the sample and raising its thermal stability from 62.8 up to 81.3 degrees C. In comparison, the thermal stabilities of glutaraldehyde or hydrazine-treated pericardium were 85 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 83.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Similar decreases in free primary amino group content and increases in thermal stability were obtained for collagen films treated with DPPA, glutaraldehyde, or hydrazine. These results were corroborated by resistance to bacterial collagenase digestion: DPPA-treated pericardium had a resistance to collagenase digestion similar to that of glutaraldehyde- or hydrazine-treated pericardium. Residual DPPA content was measured by determining the phosphorus content: the concentration of phosphorus in tissue treated with 0.5% DPPA was not significantly different from that of untreated tissue. Treatment by DPPA thus appears to be an efficient, rapid method for cross-linking collagen-based biomaterials.

In an attempt to optimize the fixation process, experiments were carried out with two types of collagen (native collagen membrane and synthetic collagen sheet) to study the effect on crosslinking of temperature, GA concentration and fixation time. Secondly, stimulation of GA diffusion was studied and finally, a procedure of low T-presoaking followed by brief exposure to high temperatures was investigated. As a measure of the degree of crosslinking the shrinkage temperature (T(s)) was determined. Temperature (20-degrees-C or 45-degrees-C), concentration (0.1% or 1.0%) or fixation time (4 or 24 h) were found to be positively correlated with the T(s) of the collagen sheets. Whereas untanned collagen exhibits a T(s), of around 60-degrees-C, short-term (1 or 5 min), high-temperature (50-degrees-C) fixation with a 0.1% GA solution caused the shrinkage temperature to increase to 72-degrees-C and 85.1-degrees-C, respectively. Fixation with 0.01% GA for 5 min at 50-degrees-C appeared equally effective as 1 min with 0.1% GA (T(s) = 70-degrees-C). Microwave irradiation showed to be slightly more effective in enhancing the crosslinking process compared with conventional heating. Surprisingly, at any combination of temperature, concentration and fixation periods of 4 h or 24 h, an increased T(s) towards the central regions of the collagen was observed. Soaking the samples at 20-degrees-C (1 h) or at 0-degrees-C (3 h) with subsequent short-time heating to 45-degrees-C caused an almost equal rise in T(s) throughout the collagen samples and is therefore recommended for preparing implantable tissues.","LEIDEN CYTOL & PATHOL LAB,2312 SP LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS","RUIJGROK, JM (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV,DEPT BIOMAT,BLD 55,RIJNSBURGERWEG 10,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,19,36,36,0,9,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The contact structure and the reaction of the contact associated contractile cytoskeleton were studied using fibres of different flexibility/mobility: butyl-S-Sepharose (S), Polysulfone (PS) and Polyurethane (PU). Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical investigations were carried out to obtain information on the influence of tension on (1) the structure of the focal contacts; (2) the constricting cytoskeleton known to retract adherent collagen or fibrin fibres and (3) the cable-like bundles of actomyosin as observed in the clot. Fibre network from S spheres and 0.3 mm thick frozen sections of PS or PU were incubated with citrated PRP or with washed platelets at 37 degrees C for 6 to 30 min while stirring for contact or activation with ADP or thrombin. Flexible fibres of the BM were found in deep invaginations of the plasmalemma associated with the constricting cytoskeleton. Focal contacts (mediated by fibrinogen as shown immunocytochemically) with fibres which were fixed in the texture or inflexible (PU) induce cable-like bundles of micofilaments containing myosin. These bundles pass across the cytoplasm and connect the contacts with the fibres or with Other platelets, as demonstrated by computer-assisted 3-dimensional reconstruction. The model used indicates that retraction is possible as long as fibres are mobile and that cable-like bundles occur when the locomotion of platelets is blocked by immobile fibres. The interaction of platelets with textured BM reflects the situation during collagen or fibrin condensation. The findings may contribute to an understanding of platelet reactions on textured surfaces in grafts.",,"MORGENSTERN, E (reprint author), UNIV SAARLAND, W-6650 HOMBURG, GERMANY.",,,,,,,43,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0953-7104,1369-1635,,PLATELETS,Platelets,FEB,1994.0,5,1,,,,,29,39,,10.3109/09537109409006038,,,,11,Cell Biology; Hematology,Cell Biology; Hematology,MW092,WOS:A1994MW09200005,21043741.0,,,,2019-02-25

The process can be initiated by intraluminal contamination and colonization of the peritoneal cavity as well as by bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, including catheters and exit site dressings. The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which two pathogenic organisms could adhere to three biomaterial surfaces, and the extent to which dextrose concentration influenced the binding and survival. Using a 24-hour in vitro assay, it was found that the Staphylococcus aureus strain consistently adhered significantly better than the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate, and only the adhesion of the latter was decreased with higher concentrations of dextrose in dialysis solutions. Electron microscopy demonstrates that within this short time period, bacterial biofilms had begun to form on the catheter surfaces.","UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT UROL SURG,LONDON,ON,CANADA; UNIV TORONTO,DEPT UROL SURG,TORONTO M5S 1A1,ON,CANADA; MONTANA STATE UNIV,CTR BIOFILM ENGN,BOZEMAN,MT 59717","REID, G (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT MICROBIOL & IMMUNOL,SLB 328,LONDON N6A 5B8,ON,CANADA.",,,,,,,20,16,16,0,1,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0250-8095,,,AM J NEPHROL,Am.

A mathematical model expressing the removal rate as a function of pertinent parameters was developed. The parameters included superficial air velocity, bubble size, bubble rising velocity, surfactant diffusion coefficient, and concentration. The model indicated that surfactant removal can be described as a first-order process whose rate increases with the diffusion coefficient, the superficial air velocity and the surfactant concentration in the bulk solution, but decreases with bubble size and bubble rising velocity. Based on the assumption of a completely mixed reactor within a section of a foam fractionator, a simplified model for foam fractionation under batch operation conditions was also presented. This simplified model provides a theoretical basis according to which the diffusion coefficient of surfactants can be determined and the model itself can be verified with experimental data.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT AGR & BIOL ENGN,ITHACA,NY 14853; CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN,ITHACA,NY 14853","CHEN, SL (reprint author), LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803, USA.",,,,,,,33,15,15,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0144-8609,,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

In the present study, we have used morphological techniques to examine the tissue response to titanium implants, and (immuno)cytochemistry to identify and characterize the organic moieties present at the bone-implant interface. Miniature titanium screws were implanted into rat tibiae. Animals were sacrificed at 1 day to 5 months post-implantation and tissues were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy, lectin-gold cytochemistry for glycoconjugates, and protein A-gold immunolabeling for non-collagenous bone and plasma proteins. Other rats were injected with H-3-proline, 4 days prior to sacrifice, to examine bone matrix deposition. New bone formation was observed soon after implantation, first as cancellous bone, which then remodeled relatively quickly into more compact bone. Radioautography confirmed bone matrix deposition in the vicinity of the implant. The presence of osteoblasts, osteoid or mineralized matrix against the implant surface indicates that bone deposition can occur both toward, and at the surface of, and then away from, the implant. Tissue components at the bone-implant interface included cells, cell debris and/or organic material with a variable appearance and thickness. A portion of the implant surface was covered with a layer (cement line/lamina limitans) rich in glycoconjugates that was intensely immunolabeled for osteopontin and alpha(2)HS-glycoprotein. Osteocalcin, fibronectin and albumin showed no preferential accumulation at the bone-implant interface. In conclusion, based on structural and compositional similarities between cement lines in bone and the bone-titanium interface, the host response to biomaterials may be similar to those osteogenic processes occurring at natural bone interfaces.","MCGILL UNIV,FAC DENT,MONTREAL H3A 2B2,PQ,CANADA; MCGILL UNIV,DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL,MONTREAL H3A 2B2,PQ,CANADA","NANCI, A (reprint author), UNIV MONTREAL,FAC DENT,CP 6128 CTR VILLE,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,PQ,CANADA.",,,,,,,60,64,65,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,1,,,,,1,30,,,,,,30,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PG257,WOS:A1994PG25700001,,,,,2019-02-25

For reasons of automation, to facilitate standardization and aid reproducibility, more objective evaluation of cytotoxic effects by quantitative methods would be preferable. In this study, three quantitative methods for cytotoxicity testing were compared with a reference method based on the examination of cell morphology. The influence of extracts of negative and positive control materials on HeLa cells was evaluated using quantitative parameters: number of cells (protein determination), viability (MTT-test), and DNA synthesis (incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine). The tests were performed according to the British Standard BS 5736 Part 10. Results were compared with those of morphological observations (reference method). Protein determination and MTT-test showed reproducible results and a good relationship with the results obtained by examining the morphology of cells. Although incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was the most sensitive test, it did not give sufficiently reproducible results as specified in BS 5736, Part 10. The main advantage of the presented tests is that they all can be performed in microtiter plates using optical density as parameter, which means that the assays can easily be automated.","UNIV MAINZ KLINIKUM, INST PATHOL, MAINZ, GERMANY","DEKKER, A (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN KLINIKUM, INST PATHOL, D-52057 AACHEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,16,37,41,0,6,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,101,112,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000001,,,,,2019-02-25

The aim of this work was to extend an organ culture method previously developed on vascular endothelium to trabecular bone. Trabecular bone cells from chick embryos and humans were comparatively grown on a control material (Thermanox(R)) and on a stainless steel 316L substrate. Two different cell types were observed around human bone explants: adherent fusiform osteoblastic cells, and non-adherent round bone marrow cells. All adherent cells were positive for alkaline phosphatase. Human cells synthesized type I collagen, osteopontin and fibronectin. Type III collagen, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein could not be detected in human cells by immunocytochemistry. Chick embryo cells synthesized type I and type III collagen and fibronectin. Type II collagen could not be detected in any species. Human cell layers were more extended and exhibited a greater number of cells than chick embryo layers. The growth parameters of chick embryo cultures displayed higher variations than human cultures. A preliminary comparison of cell growth on Thermanox(R) and on a stainless steel 316L substrate showed that human and chick embryo osteoblastic cells had similar behaviour on both materials. In conclusion, this organotypic culture method could be applied to both human and chick embryo trabecular bone. It allowed the growth of cells having the phenotype of immature osteoblasts. The culture method needs further improvement for cytocompatibility analysis.","UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,BIOL CELL EXPTL LAB,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE; HOP LARIBOISIERE,INSERM,U349,F-75010 PARIS,FRANCE","ANSELME, K (reprint author), INST CALOT,INST RECH MALAD SQUELETTE,RUE DR CALOT,F-62608 BERCK,FRANCE.",,,"Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,27,12,12,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,113,123,,,,,,11,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000002,,,,,2019-02-25

To allow investigation of the interfacial area between the cells and the metallic substrates, these materials were removed by an electrodissolution process. With such samples, a remaining titanium oxide layer was observed in close apposition with the bottom of the cell sheet. This layer was discontinuous, variable in thickness, and contained large amounts of carbon but no calcium. Contamination of the cell layer by titanium, due to the electrochemical process, was detected by electron energy loss spectrometry. The presence of mineralized matrix was demonstrated in the nodules formed by the cells on every type of specimen, but was never found in direct contact with the substrates. The thin layer of extracellular material ensuring the linkage with the substrates was not mineralized. Matrix-mediated contacts were composed of patches of collagenous material or fibrillar non-organized material. Fibronectin was detected on the substrates by fluorescence microscopy after mechanical detachment of the cell layer. The absence of a mineralized interface appears to be related to the surface properties of the substrates, but also to the cell origin. This might reflect the in vivo case of osteointegration failure, when the tissue is composed of a layer of non-mineralized connective tissue in contact with smooth materials.","ECOLE CENT LYON,TECHNOL SURFACES LAB,CNRS,URA 855,F-69130 ECULLY,FRANCE; ECOLE CENT LYON,MAT MECAN PHYS LAB,CNRS,URA 447,F-69130 ECULLY,FRANCE","BOUVIER, M (reprint author), FAC ODONTOL LYON,DEV & PATHOL TISSUS DENT LAB,CNRS,UPR 412,RUE GUILLAUME PARADIN,F-69372 LYON 8,FRANCE.",,,,,,,43,11,11,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,135,142,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000004,,,,,2019-02-25

In this review, we have summarized the results of our studies aimed at understanding the regulation of endosteal bone formation and osteoblasts. We have developed histological studies on the effects of minerals and systemic factors on endosteal osteoblasts using the model of the rodent caudal vertebrae. The cellular responsiveness to hormones and growth factors was also studied in vitro using endosteal osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse caudal vertebrae. in vivo studies showed that the osteoblastic function is directly affected by phosphate, magnesium, and strontium, which may have important implications on the interactions between biomaterials and bone cells. Systemic agents were shown to have direct effects on endosteal bone formation and osteoblast function, and indirect effects through changes in bone resorption. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that hormones (vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, testosterone, estrogens) and growth factors (epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth factor P) regulate directly and indirectly the proliferation and differentiation of endosteal osteoblastic cells, and play a major role in the induction of vertebral bone formation. Further studies on the osteoblast biology in the endosteum are required to improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the formation of new bone at the interface between osteoblasts and biomaterials.",,"MARIE, PJ (reprint author), HOP LARIBOISIERE, INSERM, U349, 6 RUE GUY PATIN, F-75010 PARIS, FRANCE.",,,,,,,99,9,10,0,2,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,2,,,,,143,154,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,PJ590,WOS:A1994PJ59000005,,,,,2019-02-25

Specifically in cardiopulmonary bypass, blood is exposed to a large material surface area, which induces an inflammatory reaction and bleeding disorders. It has been attempted to counteract these adverse effects of extracorporeal circulation by employing biocompatible materials, by pharmacological treatment of the patients, and by surface coating of the blood-contacting area. On reviewing the research field related to blood activation by cardiopulmonary bypass, it is concluded that the whole surgical procedure has to be taken into account.

This paper critically reviews recent data in this area and discusses the mechanisms involved in the reactionary and reparative processes and during the induction of odontoblast differentiation in vitro. When trying to compare primary and reparative dentinogenesis, two parameters, independently of the molecular basis of the induction, appeared to be of major importance: they concern the regulation in time and space of both the induction and the competence of the target cells.","DENT SCH BIRMINGHAM, DEPT ORAL PATHOL, BIRMINGHAM, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND; DENT SCH, DEPT DENT PATHOL & THERAPEUT, GR-54006 THESSALONIKI, GREECE","LESOT, H (reprint author), FAC MED STRASBOURG, MED BIOL INST, 11 RUE HUMANN, F-67085 STRASBOURG, FRANCE.",,,,,,,112,66,68,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,3,,,,,199,218,,,,,,20,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QF980,WOS:A1994QF98000001,,,,,2019-02-25

Since slight differences in purity, chemical composition and crystal structure of calcium phosphates can have significant effects on cell behaviour, the calcium phosphate component of the foils was analysed by X-ray diffraction. Some aspects of cellular activity in relation to the zeta potential and interfacial tension of the different surfaces were determined. Primary bovine osteoblasts were grown on the surfaces and growth and differentiation were examined. The results show that the late of cell attachment was faster on surfaces with lower surface tension. The highest indicator for differentiation was found on the biocomposite with the lowest zeta potential. Scanning electron microscope investigations showed good attachment and growth of osteoblast-like cells on all materials. It is concluded that different material properties have distinct influences on cell reactions, the zeta potential being more important than interfacial tension for differentiation.","UNIV MUNSTER,CELL BIOL LAB,D-48129 MUNSTER,GERMANY; GESELL GESUNDHEIT & UMWELTFORSCH MBH,D-65933 FRANKFURT,GERMANY; UNIV WURZBURG,DEPT EXPTL DENT,D-97070 WURZBURG,GERMANY",,,,,,,,41,12,12,1,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,3,,,,,263,274,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QF980,WOS:A1994QF98000005,,,,,2019-02-25

The goal of the study was to provide a quantification technique for standardization of the coating process. The samples were placed in a dynamic active vision system to measure three-dimensional coordinates on the surface. Surface fractal dimension was assessed over a range of scales, using the variation method. The results show that fractal dimension is a valuable parameter for the determination of surface roughness and for the study of bioadhesion.","UNIV MONTREAL,FAC PHARM,MONTREAL,PQ H3C 3J7,CANADA",,,,"Dubuc, Benoit/0000-0002-9481-3154",,,,28,4,4,0,2,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,4,,,,,379,386,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QP351,WOS:A1994QP35100007,,,,,2019-02-25

Material coated with albumin may be ''passivated'' and unlikely to trigger either thrombogenic or inflammatory responses whereas implants preincubated with plasma may attract large number of phagocytes. In an effort to understand the basis of inflammatory responses to biomaterials, we have employed implants made of polyester terephthalate. This review briefly summarizes our recent progress in determining the importance of adsorbed proteins in the attraction of phagocytic cells to device surfaces. Our initial hypothesis was that spontaneous adsorption of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was critical in later inflammatory reactions. Although samples of Mylar film, preincubated with purified IgG and implanted in mice did, as expected, prompt the accumulation of large numbers of phagocytes shortly after implantation, so also did uncoated material implanted in severely hypogammaglobulinemic mice (with severe combined immune-deficiency), implying that surface adsorption of IgG was not a necessary precedent to phagocyte responses. However, we subsequently observed that material preincubated with plasma promoted phagocyte recruitment whereas implants pre-coated with serum did not. The critical plasma component is evidently fibrinogen; not only does fibrinogen coated material attract phagocytes but uncoated material implanted in hypofibrinogen-emic mice fails to elicit an inflammatory response (unless pre-coated with fibrinogen). This pro-inflammatory effect of adsorbed fibrinogen suggests an interesting connection between two of the major iatrogenic effects of implanted and blood contact biomaterials: thrombosis and inflammation.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,ALBANY,NY 12208",,,,,,,,44,33,33,1,8,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1994.0,4,4,,,,,429,436,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,QP351,WOS:A1994QP35100012,,,,,2019-02-25

Three important questions that pertain to surgical implants are (1) What are the mechanisms that cause abnormal inflammatory responses in the absence of infection and result in interface cellular disorganization and device failure? (2) What causes host defenses to be compromised to the extent that normal flora organisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis, with little or no virulence potential, can cause life-threatening infections at the implant-host interface? (3) What is the nature of surface regions of biomaterials that facilitate bacterial adherence? Pathogenic strains of S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus have an affinity for biomaterial surfaces and are capable of initiating infection. Binding may be nonspecific and gluelike rather than a receptor-ligand event as for S. aureus and matrix proteins. This study indicates bacterial binding to sites of higher vanadium concentration at grain boundaries and mixed phases in titanium alloys. Repeated macrophage priming by biomaterial particulates results in the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, macrophage exhaustion, and adjacent tissue damage. A cytokine cascade is also initiated. A self-perpetuating enlarging immune-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone develops about implants, which features tissue cell damage, increased susceptibility to infection, and results in septic or aseptic failure of the implant. These effects are clearly exemplified by fibrosis about breast implants and osteolysis at the interface of total joint replacements.",,"GRISTINA, AG (reprint author), MED SCI RES INST,HERNDON,VA 22071, USA.",,,,NIADDK NIH HHS [AM 26957]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM 35939],,,35,166,169,0,12,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0009-921X,,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

The electrochemical behavior of these biomaterials is of interest for a variety of reasons. The corrosion resistance of an implant material influences its functional performance and durability and is a primary factor governing biocompatibility. Among the aspects affecting biocompatibility are the amounts and farms of released corrosion products and their disposition in the body after release. Electrochemical principles are very useful for understanding the factors affecting corrosion resistance and also form the foundation for many biosensors that measure the concentration of various chemical entities (including released corrosion products and naturally occurring substances). Many electrochemical measurement techniques have been used to study biomaterials for years (e.g., polarization curve measurement), while others (such as polarography and AC impedance methods) have been applied more recently. This work focuses on four main topics. The first is the nature of the body's environment as it affects in vivo electrochemical phenomena, that is, the chemical, mechanical, biological, and bioelectrical phenomena that affect the behavior and performance of biomaterials. The second deals with methodology - the techniques used for corrosion measurement and concentration determination, the appropriate environment (laboratory, cell culture, in vivo, etc.), and experimental problems encountered. The third topic treated is the knowledge accumulated regarding the performance of implant alloys in various applications, for example, the forms of corrosion to which they are susceptible, etc. Finally, improvements that may come about in the future regarding both materials and testing methodology are considered.",,"BUNDY, KJ (reprint author), TULANE UNIV, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70118 USA.",,,,,,,1672,83,83,0,26,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",0278-940X,1943-619X,,CRIT REV BIOMED ENG,Crit.

In the design and development of formulations to achieve this goal, the formulation scientist must consider the clinical indication, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and physicochemical stability of the drug. The development of a stable formulation is a necessary step for each new protein or peptide therapeutic. The degradation pathways and their impact on stability should be systematically analyzed and competing degradation rates must be balanced to arrive at the most stable formulation possible. Several routes of administration should also be considered and future development of new formulations may expand the number of potential options. Formulations for each route of administration may be unique and, therefore, have special requirements. In the case of depot formulations, there are many potential matrices, each of which has distinct characteristics that affect its interactions with the drug and its behavior in vivo. The formulation characteristics may have a dramatic impact on the in vivo stability of the drug as well as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The optimization of formulations, the routes of delivery, the design of depot systems, and the correlation between physicochemical stability and in vivo behavior are discussed in detail with recent examples. For new biotechnology-derived drugs including nucleic acids (DNA vectors and antisense RNA) to reach commercialization, all of the issues involved in the design and development of a drug formulation must be considered at an early stage of the overall development process.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","CLELAND, JL (reprint author), GENENTECH INC, S SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94080 USA.",,"Sanguansri, Luz/B-6630-2011","Sanguansri, Luz/0000-0003-1908-7604",,,,103,26,26,1,1,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,,0-8412-2959-7,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

The preservation of proteins during freezing and drying is fundamentally different for each process. Protection of labile proteins during freezing appears to be due to the same thermodynamic mechanism that accounts for solute-induced stabilization in nonfrozen aqueous solution. Namely, preferential exclusion of the solute leads to stabilization of the native state of the protein. Protection of proteins during drying by sugars is due to the sugar hydrogen bonding to the dried protein and serving as a water replacement. Recovery of enzyme activity after freeze-drying and rehydration correlates directly with the maintenance of the native protein structure in the dried state. Sugars protect labile proteins by inhibiting lyophilization-induced unfolding. Finally, certain polymers (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone). protect freeze-dried multimeric enzymes during freeze-drying and rehydration. These compounds cannot serve as ''water replacements'' in the dried state. Rather they inhibit the freezing- and drying-induced dissociation. The fully polymerized oligomers are more resistant to these stresses.","AMGEN INC,AMGEN CTR,THOUSAND OAKS,CA 91320","CARPENTER, JF (reprint author), UNIV COLORADO,HLTH SCI CTR,SCH MED,DENVER,CO 80262, USA.",,,,,,,33,51,51,0,11,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0097-6156,,0-8412-2959-7,ACS SYM SER,,,1994.0,567,,,,,,134,147,,,,,,14,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,BB32M,WOS:A1994BB32M00009,,,,,2019-02-25

In this perspective, the consideration of biological membranes at a molecular level requires detailed knowledge of the preferred conformations of the triglycerides in their various polymorphic forms. In this context, we adapted a molecular modeling approach, which allows the simulation the three-dimensional structure of the different polymorphic forms (alpha, beta', and beta) valid for any triglyceride. Their conformational analysis is based on molecular mechanics calculations, as follows: First, a large number of isolated molecular structures were generated in asystematic structure-tree analysis. For their generation, atomic charges within the Mulliken scheme, calculated at the ab initio RHF-LCAO-MO-SCF level (6-31G), were considered. The lowest-energy conformers were, next, correlated with experimental data (NMR, powder X-ray diffraction) in order to select alpha, beta', or beta structures. Then, in a second step, these selected conformers were assembled, in head-to-tail dimers in order to form a monolayer. For this step, the use of potential-derived atomic charges is known to be more suitable. In this study, we consider triglycerides derived from the predominant fatty acids, i.e., stearic, elaidic, and oleic acids.

The D-H-D polymer product was characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13-NMR). D-H-D was physisorbed on polyethylene (PE) from aqueous solution, and the adhesion stability and resistance to protein adsorption was examined under static and dynamic flow conditions, using a modified rotating disk system. Modified surfaces were characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and by water contact angles. Under applied shear stresses of up to 73 dyn cm(-2), the adhesion of D-H-D on PE was sufficient to inhibit desorption by water (>90% D-H-D on PE was retained) and 5% SDS surfactant solution (approximately 83% D-H-D retained), as determined by ATR-FTIR. Under similar shear stress conditions, albumin adsorption on D-H-D modified PE was reduced by over 90%, and protein adsorption from fresh human plasma was reduced by approximately 70% compared with unmodified PE. The results are discussed in terms of interfacial forces, and the suitability of this approach for studying protein-surface interactions and for developing a novel class of protein-resistant biomaterials.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106","MARCHANT, RE (reprint author), CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106, USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-40047],,,50,42,44,1,16,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The adhesion of HPL was shown to be dependent not only on the wettability but also on the protein preadsorbed. Vitronectin expressed not only a higher extent of adhesion under static conditions but also a stronger interaction with HPL, indicated by the low detachment under shear stress. The flow experiments also demonstrated that FN adsorbed on octadecyl glass may undergo conformational changes because HPL could be easily removed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that HPL on both FN-and VN-coated glass spread well whereas particularly on FN-coated octadecyl glass less cell spreading was observed; moreover, some round cells were detected. The typing of adherent HPL by immunofluorescence microscopy showed that on FN- and VN-coated glass about 70% of all HPL were T-cells (CD 3+). However, on octadecyl glass, particularly on VN, a smaller percentage of CD 3+cell was observed. The testing for the beta(1) integrin-the receptor for FN and the alpha(v) integrin-the receptor for VN demonstrated that about 70% of all cells on FN-coated glass were positive for the beta(1) integrin. On VN-coated glass, however, only 5% of HPL were positive for the beta(1) integrin. Although on VN a high adhesion and strong binding of HPL was observed, no presence of the alpha(v)integrin was detected.","BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,CENT LAB BIOPHYS,BU-1113 SOFIA,BULGARIA","GROTH, T (reprint author), HUMBOLDT UNIV BERLIN,SCH MED,BIOMAT RES UNIT,TUCHHOLSKYSTR 2,D-10098 BERLIN,GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,37,24,24,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Isolated human blood neutrophils were allowed to interact with the polymer surface and the chemiluminescence response of the cells was recorded as a measure of oxidative activation. The polymers represented surfaces that differed markedly with respect to charge, hardness, and wettability. We found that all polymers stimulated the chemiluminescence response in neutrophils differently; when preincubation with human serum albumin (HSA) there was a general reduction of the chemiluminescence response particularly on one of the positively charged surface 1, 2-diamino-cyclohexane (DACH). Addition of a soluble stimulus, the chemoattractant formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP), to the cells caused a dramatic increase in the response on one of the hydrophobic surface hexamethylene-isiloxane (HMDSO). However, there was also a pronounced reduction in the response on polymers with acrylic acid (AA). The response was normalized after addition of HSA. Taken together, the chemiluminescene response of the neutrophils interacting with the polymer surfaces differed with regard to the type of surfaces. When HSA and FMLP were added a larger difference in the response was found. Our results showed that the activation of human neutrophil granulocytes influenced by different polymer surfaces, followed unspecific different patterns which were someway related to the specific characteristics of the polymer and from this point we came to similar conclusions made by Kaplan et al. (J. Biomater. Res. 28, 377 (1994)), that it is difficult to extrapolate any activation mechanisms from one material to another. The reproducibility of the reaction patterns, the importance of neutrophil activation, and the relative simplicity of the method indicates, however, that the mechanisms of neutrophil activation at biomaterial surface is well worth further research.","LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL IMMUNOL & INFECT DIS,LINKOPING,SWEDEN; INST SURFACE CHEM,S-11486 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","NIMERI, G (reprint author), LINKOPING UNIV,DEPT PHYS & MEASUREMENT TECHNOL,APPL PHYS LAB,INTERFACE BIOL GRP,S-58183 LINKOPING,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,28,4,4,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

On the one hand, leukocyte affinity tau(s)(leu) (number of deposited leukocytes mm-2 s-1) was not significantly different between IUPAC.PVC (tau(s)(leu) = 1.2-2.5) and PRM.PDMS (tau(s)(leu) = 1.5-3.4) and the fibrinogen adsorption rate varied from 33 to 48.10(-5) mug mm-2 s-1 for both these materials. On the other hand, platelet affinity tau(s)(plat) (number of deposited platelets mm-2 s-1) was significantly different (p < 0.05) for IUPAC.PVC and PRM.PDMS (tau(s)(plat)PVC = 683 +/- 200 > tau(s)(plat)PDMS = 327 +/- 80). Scanning electron micrographs of adherent platelets, red cells and leukocytes after blood contact ex vivo were performed after each experiment.

The diphenols were a homologous series of three desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters (ethyl, hexyl, octyl) which had previously been used in the synthesis of mechanically strong and tissue-compatible polycarbonates. The diacids (succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid) were selected among compounds that were known to be of low systemic toxicity. By using different diacids as comonomers, the flexibility of the polymer backbone could be varied while the desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters provided pendent chains of various length. Some of the thermal and mechanical properties of the five polymers could be correlated to their chemical structure: the glass transition temperature decreased from 53 to 13 degrees C, and the tensile modulus (measured at room temperature) decreased from 1500 to about 3 MPa when the length of the aliphatic diacid in the polymer backbone and/or the length of the alkyl ester pendent chain was increased. The presence of an arylate bond in the polymer backbone introduced a hydrolytically labile linkage into the polymer structure. Under physiological conditions in vitro all polymers degraded: thin films retained only about 30-40% of their initial molecular weight (M(w)) after 26 weeks of storage in phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Release studies with p-nitroaniline as a model drug indicated that a diffusion controlled release process occurred. The rate of p-nitroaniline release could be correlated with the glass transition temperature of the polymer.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ",,,,,,,,29,49,49,0,7,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Infrared spectra showed the presence of amide groups, including those cases where the volatile compound ('monomer') did not contain oxygen. The performance of the surfaces in cell attachment correlated with the surface hydrophilicity and the nitrogen content, although for the latter a fair degree of scatter indicated that a more complex relationship applies. All these surfaces supported the attachment and growth of human cells. Generally, amide plasma polymers were best but the individual monomer and the plasma parameters also played a role. From comparisons of the various surfaces, it is suggested that the amide group is the main promoter of cell attachment in nitrogen-containing plasma surfaces.","CSIRO, DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN, N RYDE, NSW 2113, AUSTRALIA","GRIESSER, HJ (reprint author), CSIRO, DIV CHEM & POLYMERS, PRIVATE BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA.",,"Griesser, Hans/E-5628-2011","Griesser, Hans/0000-0003-1072-7863",NCRR NIH HHS [RRO1296],,,61,158,160,1,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Platelets were labeled with In-111-oxine. The least thrombogenic material was Avcothane 51 elastomere. The only effective treatment for reduction of platelet deposition on the six materials was 5 mg/kg BW/day of acetylsalicylic acid. The dose used in group 3 only decreased the deposition of platelets on three of the six materials studied.

This finding directly supports the hypothesis that hydrated silica plays an important role in biologically active hydroxyapatite formation on the surfaces of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics, which leads to bone-bonding. Gel-derived titania is also a hydroxyapatite inducer because of its abundant TiOH groups. These results provide further insight into the unique osseointegration of titanium and its alloys. It is suspected that gel-derived titania develops an apatite layer by taking calcium and phosphate from the body fluid, thus producing bone-bonding. Although sufficient A1OH groups may remain in the alumina gel, they do not serve to initiate apatite generation when immersed in SBF. This phenomenon explains the fact that an intermediate fibrous tissue is usually found to separate the alumina implant from bone. One may infer that both abundant OH groups and negatively charged surfaces of gel-derived silica and titania are important for hydroxyapatite induction. Material which possesses and/or develops both a negatively charged surface and abundant OH groups in a physiologically-related fluid is most likely to be an efficient apatite inducer. Such materials are suitable candidates to serve as bone-bonding biomaterials.

In this study, two methods of in vitro enzyme degradation and a method for the separation of the degradative products by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) are reported. In the first method two dental adhesives, Scotchbond and Scotchbond II, and two dental composites, Heliomolar and P-50, were evaluated. These materials were incubated with four different enzymatic preparations for periods of up to 72 h. The enzymes were Lipase, esterase, and Liver enzyme extracts from both mouse and rat. Chloroform soluble products extracted from the aqueous phase were examined by HPTLC for decomposition products resulting from enzyme activity. The second method was similar, but analyzed the aqueous fraction directly without chloroform extraction. In this method five dental restorative materials, P-50, P-30, Scotchbond II, Silux, and Silux plus, were incubated with a nonspecific porcine liver esterase. In addition to the polymerized biomaterials, monomers containing methacrylic acid units were also hydrolyzed with esterase and analyzed by ion chromatography to establish the sensitivity of the enzyme simulator. Each biomaterial presented thin-layer zones not present before enzymatic action. These experiments provide support that aqueous enzymatic action may facilitate the hydrolytic weakening of polymeric biomaterials.

Present-day biomaterials being biocompatible when in bulk form, a host reaction consequent upon untoward effects of the implants as such is not expected. Thus, osseointegration, i.e., the direct apposition of bone to the surface of a foreign material at the light microscopical level, occurs, under favorable biomechanical circumstances, irrespective of the chemical composition of the implant. Osseointegration is a multifaceted phenomenon. First and foremost, it evolves when an initially rigid fixation of the component is surgically attained. Interfacial motions are associated with resorption of the bony bed, macrophagic activation and production of wear particles, the close bone-implant apposition is lost and the formation of an interfacial membrane (IM) ensues. The histological features of the IM coincide with the context of its formation and evolution. The quiescent IM is composed of a thin layer of fibrous tissue and its occurrence is compatible with the biofunctionality of the implant. The aggressive or lytic IM (LIM) develops when tissue-irritating, small, irregularly shaped and edgy breakdown products are deposited at the interface. The thick LIM consists of an inflamed fibrous tissue, scattered within which are myriad granulomas, and its surface facing the implant displays a synovial-like aspect. The mono-and polykaryonic macrophages, constituting the granulomatous response, ingest and abut on the wear particles. Amongst the intermediary substances of inflammation elaborated by the lymphocytes and macrophages of the LIM, factors which stimulate the osteoclasts play the pivotal role in as much as progressive bone resorption is associated with progressive growth of the IM and, hence, with incremental interfacial motion, interfacial deposition of wear particles and inflammatory-granulomatous response. The ensuing vicious circle culminates in aseptic loosening of the arthroplasty. The morphological features of the LIM, though characterized by a stereotypical reaction pattern, are, in their details, closely linked with the nature of the diverse components of the composite joint replacement. The histological appearances of the bone-implant interface of stable and loose arthroplasties, the tissular reactions to polymethylmethacrylate, polyethylene, polyacetal, metals and hydroxyapatite as well as the characteristics of cemented acid cementless porous-coated, press-fit and hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses are described.","BNAI ZION MED CTR, DEPT PATHOL, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL; BNAI ZION MED CTR, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL","BOSS, JH (reprint author), TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL, FAC MED, BRUCE RAPPAPORT INST RES MED SCI, CTR IMPLANT SURG, POB 4940, IL-31048 HAIFA, ISRAEL.",,,,,,,265,36,37,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

OPs initiate chondroblastic differentiation in pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, followed by the synthesis of new bone by endochondral ossification. OPs have the ability to induce healing of osteoperiosteal defects in several animal models, supporting a possible therapeutic role in the reconstruction of bone defects. OPs are responsible for the osteoinductive capacity of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) implants, which may also prove to be clinically useful. Preliminary studies using purified, naturally occurring human osteogenic proteins in the clinical management of non-unions have reported promising results. A prospective, randomized clinical trial is currently underway, comparing recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1) to autograft in the treatment of tibial non-unions.

A prospective study addressing these factors was therefore undertaken over an 11 month period. 51 patients presenting with significant capsular contracture, suspected prosthesis rupture or unrelieved implant-induced anxiety underwent revisional breast surgery after biochemical, haematological and immunological screening. Of these 51 patients (83 breasts), 14 (19 breasts) had ruptured implants (23% incidence). These were all smooth prostheses belonging to a cohort manufactured more than 10 years ago; their mean in situ duration being 12 years vs. 5.5 years for the intact group (p = 0.0024; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). There were no systemic complications from implant rupture and the mean blood silicon level was normal. One patient with pre-existing pernicious anaemia had elevated autoantibodies. The mean ESR in the ruptured implant group was 6 mm/hour. It is concluded that rupture of breast implants is not as uncommon as hitherto thought and is strongly correlated with their in situ duration. In this study implant gel leakage was not associated with serious systemic effects.","ST LUKES HOSP, DEPT RADIOL, BRADFORD BD7 1DP, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","MALATA, CM (reprint author), ST LUKES HOSP, DEPT PLAST SURG, BRADFORD BD7 1DP, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,69,29,29,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0047-6552,,,MED PROG TECHNOL,Med.

First, genetic engineering techniques have been used in conjunction with silane-based self-assembly systems to construct close-packed protein monolayers on optical substrates. The resulting structures have been characterized with immunological and surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy techniques. Recombinant DNA techniques have also been used to study the role of electrostatic forces in protein-protein interactions and may be used to gain control over the assembly of multicomponent protein thin films. In addition to these assembly considerations, protein engineering techniques can be used for a second purpose: the manipulation of optical and ET properties of heme proteins. Control over the heme absorption transition energies, redox potentials, and redox center composition can be realized through a combination of genetic engineering and protein. chemistry techniques.

The surface of all currently available biomaterials stimulate, microscopically or macroscopically, the host biological system when in direct contact. As a result, complement activation, blood coagulation, thrombus formation, encapsulation, and calcification take place. It has been shown that surface modification by grafting techniques can markedly reduce such stimulation, thus improving the interfacial biocompatibility of currently used biomedical polymers.

We report here the design, synthesis, and characterization of recombinant protein polymers based on multimers of 15 amino acid consensus sequences approximating the more complex natural protein. Spontaneous fibrillar aggregate formation in the genetically engineered analogs has been confirmed by various methods and the propensity of such aggregates to phase separate into liquid crystalline arrays has been observed.

These phenomena often involve an increase in chemokinesis and cellular secretory activity, usually expressed in antimicrobial activity. Once activated, the cells can move quickly towards the source of the stimulus, where they produce and release great amounts of enzymes (e.g. proteases, hydrolases, lysozyme) and reactive oxygen metabolites (e.g. O2-., H2O2, OH.). This study has examined the ability of surfaces of selected biomaterials to influence neutrophil morphology and locomotion. The surface of two films derived from hyaluronic acid derivatives were compared with that of glass. The two hyaluronic acid derivatives, despite having a similar chemical structure, were shown to interact with human neutrophils in different ways. A hyaluronic acid ethyl ester stimulated the whole population of neutrophils to take up a non-spherical morphology (polarize) and to move with a velocity similar to that of N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine-stimulated cells on a glass surface. In contrast, only 44% of the examined cells on the surface of hyaluronic acid benzyl ester were polarized and their mean speed was only slightly higher with respect to that found with non-stimulated cells on glass. Moreover, while on the benzyl ester and on glass a correlation between neutrophil circularity (i.e. the shape of the cell) and cell speed was found, the ethyl ester did not show any correlation.","UNIV LIVERPOOL, DEPT CLIN ENGN, POB 147, LIVERPOOL L69 3BX, ENGLAND; FIDIA RES LABS, DIV ADV TECHNOL, I-35031 ABANO TERME, ITALY",,,"Campoccia, Davide/K-5348-2018; Hunt, John/G-6366-2012","Campoccia, Davide/0000-0002-3336-0219; Hunt, John/0000-0002-5168-4778",,,,14,18,18,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,DEC,1993.0,14,15,,,,,1135,1139,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90156-V,,,,5,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,MP264,WOS:A1993MP26400004,8130317.0,,,,2019-02-25

Cell membrane integrity can be determined by different tests depending upon the cell membrane permeability to various markers. To measure the degree of cell damage, we have chosen to compare the release of two markers in the supernatants: enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, which we wanted to compare to that of radioactive chromium preincorporated in cells, the latter being validated by a standard), from three cell types: cells from a fibroblastic cell line (3T3 Balb/c) and human differentiated endothelial cells and osteoblasts, exposed to injurious agents and to biomaterials of classical use. The labeling procedure as well as the incubation periods performed, were carried out according to a standard. Cell labeling efficiency ranged from 4 to 10%. The biomaterials tested provoked no or slight cell membrane damage. After linear regression analysis, we found high correlation coefficients between chromium release and LDH release. Thus, the determination of LDH activity, which is easy to manipulate, could be a satisfactory test to evaluate cell membrane integrity in contact with biomaterials and a prerequisite stage before the more sophisticated chromium-51 release test.

Characterization by contact angles, surface spectroscopy, and ellipsometry verified that these model surfaces could be repeatedly prepared with good consistency for routine use to study biomolecule adsorption onto model surfaces.

These structural differences imparted different amphiphilic characters that led to measurable differences in the adsorption of these peptides to liquid-vapor interfaces. The adsorption to model surfaces was studied using ESCA, radiometry, and concentration-dependent contact angles. ESCA and radiometry measured irreversible biomolecules adsorption whereas the contact angle method measured steady-state adsorption.

Therefore, predegraded poly(L-lactic acid) (P-PLLA) and nontreated PLLA (N-PLLA) particles, both having diameters not exceeding 38 mu m, were injected intraperitoneally in mice. P-PLLA particles were obtained by 25 kGy gamma-irradiation of N-PLLA particles. N-PLLA and P-PLLA particles were injected using an 0.3% ethanol/0.90% saline solution intraperitoneally to the mice. We also studied the release of the absorbed ethanol as a possible model for the release of low molecular weight, potentially toxic products. As control, nondegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles and the carrier solution were used. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 days, the cells of the abdominal cavity were harvested to study the effect of phagocytosis of polymer particles on phagocytic cell morphology and viability. Studies with transmission electron microscopy indicated that, upon injection of particles in the peritoneal cavity, macrophages demonstrated signs of cell damage, cell death, and cell lysis due to phagocytosis of a large amount of P-PLLA particles. The morphology of the cells that had phagocytosed the N-PLLA and PTFE particles did not differ substantially from those of control animals in which only the solution was injected. Also, in the controls, hardly any cell death and no debris was observed. When the PLLA particles were injected as a suspension in a 0.3% ethanol/0.90% saline solution, no difference was observed between N-PLLA and P-PLLA. After phagocytosis, both cause cell damage, sometimes leading to cell death. The highest numbers of necrotic cells were observed on day 2. The effects could be caused by the (peak) release of degradation products from P-PLLA fragments or by the release of the absorbed ethanol when the 0.3 ethanol/0.9 saline solution was used to administer the particles. In conclusion, it can be stated that cell damager sometimes leading to cell death, may be caused by phagocytosed poly(L-lactic acid) particles.

Early interactions between implants and inflammatory cells are probably mediated by a layer of host proteins on the material surface. To evaluate the importance of this protein layer, we studied acute inflammatory responses of mice to samples of polyester terephthalate film (PET) that were implanted intraperitoneally for short periods. Material preincubated with albumin is ''passivated,'' accumulating very few adherent neutrophils or macrophages, whereas uncoated or plasma-coated PET attracts large numbers of phagocytes. Neither IgG adsorption nor surface complement activation is necessary for this acute inflammation; phagocyte accumulation on uncoated implants is normal in hypogammaglobulinemic mice and in severely hypocomplementemic mice. Rather, spontaneous adsorption of fibrinogen appears to be critical: (a) PET coated with serum or hypofibrinogenemic plasma attracts as few phagocytes as does albumin-coated material; (b) in contrast, PET preincubated with serum or hypofibrinogenemic plasma containing physiologic amounts of fibrinogen elicits ''normal'' phagocyte recruitment; (c) most importantly, hypofibrinogenemic mice do not mount an inflammatory response to implanted PET unless the material is coated with fibrinogen or the animals are injected with fibrinogen before implantation. Thus, spontaneous adsorption of fibrinogen appears to initiate the acute inflammatory response to an implanted polymer, suggesting an interesting nexus between two major iatrogenic effects of biomaterials: clotting and inflammation.","ALBANY MED COLL, DIV EXPTL PATHOL, A81, 47 NEW SCOTLAND RD, ALBANY, NY 12208 USA",,,,,,,,87,331,333,1,37,ROCKEFELLER UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"950 THIRD AVE, 2ND FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10022 USA",0022-1007,1540-9538,,J EXP MED,J.

The individual polymorphs were prepared and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy, and physical appearance. The FTR spectra of the two polymorphs showed distinct differences which result from ''crystal splitting'' effects. A series of 13 different mixtures of polymorph A and B was prepared by geometric mixing and their FTR spectra statistically analysed by factor analysis programming. Predictions of the A/B polymorphic composition of mixtures were made and compared with the theoretical values. The results demonstrate that FTRS combined with factor analysis programming may be successfully applied to the in situ monitoring of the A/B polymorphic nature of a chlorpropamide sample.","COURTAULDS RES, COVENTRY CV6 5RS, ENGLAND; UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, DEPT CHEM, SOUTHAMPTON SO9 5NH, HANTS, ENGLAND; UNIV NOTTINGHAM, DEPT PHARMACEUT SCI, NOTTINGHAM NG7 2RD, ENGLAND",,,,"Davies, Martyn/0000-0001-7695-0596",,,,15,45,45,0,10,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,1573-904X,,PHARM RES-DORDR,Pharm.

One approach involves the covalent attachment of photoisomerizable components such as azobenzene units or thiophenefulgide components. In one of the photoisomer states of the photoactive units, the tertiary structure of the proteins is retained and, consequently, their biological functionalities are switched ''ON''. In the complementary photoisomer state, the structure of the proteins is distorted and its activities are switched ''OFF''. The hydrolytic activities of papain have been photostimulated by covalent linkage of azobenzene units. While trans-azobenzene-modified papain reveals bioactivity towards hydrolysis of N-alpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-nitroanilide (7), cisazobenzene-modified papain is switched ''OFF'' towards the hydrolytic process. Similarly, association of the saccharide 4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (11) to thiophenefulgide-modified concanavalin A is photostimulated. The second approach for controlling the activities of biomaterials involves their immobilization in photoisomerizable polymers. In these systems photostimulated transport of the protein substrates across the polymer matrices triggered ''ON-OFF'' the functions of the encapsulated biomaterial. alpha-Chymotrypsin was immobilized in the series of photochromic copolymers consisting of acrylamide and 1-beta-(methacryloxy)ethyl-3,3'-dimethyl-6-nitrospiroindoline-2,2'-[2H-1]benzopyran(l2), bis(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-(4-vinylphenyl)methyl leucohydroxide (14) or 4-(methacryloylamino) azobenzene (15). The hydrolysis of N-(3 -carboxypropionyl) -L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide (13) by alpha-chymotrypsin is controlled by the permeability properties of 12 across the different photoisomer states of the respective polymers.","HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,FARKAS CTR LIGHT INDUCED PROC,IL-91904 JERUSALEM,ISRAEL","WILLNER, I (reprint author), HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,INST CHEM,IL-91904 JERUSALEM,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,13,23,24,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0923-1137,,,REACT POLYM,React.

Genetic engineering methods can be used to modify the chemical composition of the storage compounds in many plant species. This will create opportunities to expand the uses of biomaterials as renewable and environmentally more benign alternatives to some uses of petrochemicals. Many of the most promising opportunities, in this respect, involve relatively minor modifications of the chemical composition of plant oils. The introduction of a single functional group into a fatty acid may create new industrial uses for the fatty acid and, therefore, significantly increase the value of the oil. Because different species of higher plants accumulate at least 210 different kinds of fatty acids, the genetic resources are available to support the production of a wide variety of modifications of agricultural oilseed species by genetic engineering.

The effect of hydrophobic forces on the rheology of concentrated dispersions of collagen fibers was studied by dynamic rheological measurements over temperatures ranging from 283 to 308 K. The results are interpreted in terms of the associated relaxation time spectra and the theory of Kamphuis et al. for concentrated dispersions. Increases in fiber rigidity are seen from a progressive decrease in the slope of the linear log G' (or G'') vs. log omega data recorded for these dispersions as temperature is increased. A molecular interpretation of this result was obtained by treating collagen fibers as a liquid crystalline phase of rigid-rod collagen molecules that have phase-separated from aqueous solution. Hydrophobic forces affect the volume fraction of water that is present in the phase-separated fibers, which, in turn, affects the rigidity of the fibers. Distinct yielding behavior (in the nonlinear viscoelastic region) occurs at temperatures above 293 K and reflects a gel transition. Thermal gelation of collagen dispersions is proposed to proceed through hydrophobically driven mechanisms of increased fiber rigidity and enhanced interfiber attractive forces.

Samples were taken at days 7, 14, and 21 after implantation. As early as day 7, osteogenesis and resorption were observed at the surface of the biomaterials, inside the macropores. Resorption of both newly formed bone and calcium-phosphate biomaterials was associated with two types of multinucleated cells. Giant multinucleated cells were found only at the surface of the biomaterials; they showed a large number of nuclei, were TRAP negative, developed no ruffled border, and contained numerous vacuoles with large accumulation of mineral crystals from the biomaterials. Osteoclasts exhibited TRAP positivity and well-defined ruffled border. They were observed at the surface of both newly formed bone and biomaterials, around the implant, and inside the macropores. In contact with the biomaterials, infoldings of their ruffled border were observed between the mineral crystals, deeply inside the microporosity. The microporosity of the biomaterials (i.e., the noncrystalline spaces inside the biomaterials) increased underneath this type of cell as compared with underneath giant cells or to the depth of the biomaterials. These observations demonstrate that macroporous calcium-phosphate biomaterials implanted in bone elicit osteogenesis and the recruitment of a double multinucleated cell population having resorbing activity: giant multinucleated cells that resorb biomaterials and osteoclasts that resorb newly formed bone and biomaterials.","UNIV ANGERS, SERV COMMUN MICROSCOPIE ELECTRON, ANGERS, FRANCE; FAC CHIRURG DENT, RECH TISSUS CALCIFIES & BIOMAT LAB, NANTES, FRANCE","BASLE, MF (reprint author), FAC MED ANGERS, HISTOL EMBRYOL LAB, RUE HAUTE RECULEE, F-49045 ANGERS, FRANCE.",,"Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,43,80,82,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0171-967X,1432-0827,,CALCIFIED TISSUE INT,Calcif.

Complex devices such as total joint replacement and the total artificial heart represent combinations of polymers and metal alloys for system and organ replacement. The major barrier to the extended use of these devices is bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, which causes biomaterial-centered infection, and the lack of successful tissue integration or compatibility with biomaterial surfaces. Adhesion-mediated infections are extremely resistant to antibiotics and host defenses and frequently persist until the biomaterial or foreign body is-removed. The pathogenesis of adhesive infections is related, in part, to preferential colonization of ''inert'' substrata whose surfaces are not integrated with healthy tissues composed of living cells and intact extracellular polymers. Tissue integration is an interesting parallel to microbial adhesion and is a desired phenomenon for the biocompatibility of certain implants and biomaterials. Tissue integration requires a form of eukaryocytic adhesion or compatibility with possible chemical integration to an implant surface. Many of the fundamental principles of interfacial science apply to both microbial adhesion and to tissue integration and are general to and independent of the substratum materials involved. interactions of biomaterials with bacteria and tissue cells are directed not only by specific receptors and outer membrane molecules on the cell surface, but also by the atomic geometry and electronic state of the biomaterial surface. An understanding of these mechanisms is important to all fields of medicine and is derived from and relevant to studies in microbiology, biochemistry, and physics. modifications of biomaterial surfaces at an atomic level will allow the programming of cell-to-substratum events, thereby diminishing infection by enhancing tissue compatibility or integration, or by directly inhibiting bacterial adhesion.","INST KNOXVILLE,KNOXVILLE,TN","GRISTINA, AG (reprint author), MSRI,2190 FOX MILL RD,HERNDON,VA 22071, USA.",,,,,,,53,83,83,4,11,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

From biomaterials development to biomedical power sources, the supporting industry and spin-off benefit was broad indeed. Young people were seeking careers in biomedical engineering and science. The National Institutes of Health was supporting artificial heart research at $10 to $12 million dollar levels. Groups at Andros, Inc. (now Baxter Novacor) and Stanford, Thoratec, Penn State and the Hershey Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic and the Division of Artificial Organs, the University of Utah, the Texas Heart Institute and the Baylor College of Medicine, Thermal Electron Corporation, and many more were the source of research and breakthrough development of pumps and systems for artificial hearts. We reported on performance criteria for an artificial heart pump at the First Biomechanics Symposium in 1973 [1]. By the beginning of the decade of the 90's, thousands of presentations had been made and manuscripts written reporting significant progress in the development of artificial heart pumps and systems. The Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health was supporting an artificial heart contract research and development program at a level of $6 million dollars in 1991 [2].

The SECM operates as an aqueous electrochemical cell under bipotentiostatic control with a microelectrode and sample independently biased as working electrodes. Microelectrode current and position is recorded as it is scanned very near a metallurgically polished planar sample surface. To date, the SECM has imaged metallic biomaterials surfaces in oxygen reaction rate imaging (ORRI) and ion release and deposition imaging (IRDI) modes. In ORRI, sample and microelectrode are biased at sufficiently negative potentials to reduce absorbed oxygen. As the microelectrode scans areas of active oxygen reduction, localized diffusion fields with decreased oxygen solution concentrations are encountered and resultant decrements in microelectrode current are observed. In IRDI mode the sample is positively biased and the microelectrode is negatively biased. The microelectrode detects anodic dissolution products with highest currents being observed over the most active areas. Performance of the SECM has been evaluated on Ni minigrids, gamma-1 Hg-Ag dental amalgam crystals, and sintered beads of Co-Cr-Mo alloy which represent significantly different geometries and corrosion processes to help demonstrate the potential of this instrument. The SECM is a valuable tool for imaging microelectrochemical processes on the surfaces of metallurgically polished metallic biomaterials samples and a wide variety of other surfaces of biological interest where charge transfer reactions occur. The SECM allows selective biasing of metallic biomaterials surfaces and Faradaic reactions can be selectively imaged while the surface is in the active, passive, or transpassive state.

For example, polyetherurethane elastomers used as cardiac pacemaker lead insulation have developed surface defects after implantation. This phenomenon, termed ''environmental stress cracking,'' requires intimate contact between polymer and host phagocytic cells, suggesting that phagocyte-generated oxidants might be involved. Indeed, brief exposure of polyetherurethane to activated human neutrophils, hypochlorous acid, or peroxynitrite produces modifications of the polymer similar to those found in vivo. Damage to the polymer appears to arise predominantly from oxidation of the urethane-aliphatic ester and aliphatic ether groups. There are substantial increases in the solid phase surface oxygen content of samples treated with hypochlorous acid, peroxynitrite or activated human neutrophils, resembling those observed in explanted polyetherurethane. Furthermore, both explanted and hypochlorous acid-treated polyether-urethane show marked reductions in polymer molecular weight. Interestingly, hypochlorous acid and peroxynitrite appear to attack polyetherurethane at different sites. Hypochlorous acid or activated neutrophils cause decreases in the urethane-aliphatic ester stretch peak relative to the aliphatic ether stretch peak (as determined by infrared spectroscopy) whereas peroxynitrite causes selective loss of the aliphatic ether. In vivo degradation may involve both hypohalous and nitric oxide-based oxidants because, after long-term implantation, both stretch peaks are diminished. These results suggest that in vivo destruction of implanted polyetherurethane involves attack by phagocyte-derived oxidants.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL,A-81,47 NEW SCOTLAND AVE,ALBANY,NY 12208; UNIV MINNESOTA,BIOMED ENGN PROGRAM,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT SURG,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; MEDTRONIC INC,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55432",,,,,,,,29,99,99,0,4,ROCKEFELLER UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"1114 FIRST AVE, 4TH FL, NEW YORK, NY 10021",0021-9738,,,J CLIN INVEST,J.

They are described in terms of a relationship betwen a relative stiffness R(T,M) defined as the ratio between a modulus or storage modulus at a temperature T, and moisture M, and its magnitude in the glassy state. The relationship, in turn, is expressed by the model R(T,M)= 1/(1+exp [(T-T-c(M))/a(M))] where T-c(M) is a critical temperature identifying the transition temperature range and a(M) a constant representing the relationship's slope. The proposed model correctly accounts for the downward concavity of the stiffness vs temperature relationship at the transition onset. Published data on biosolids indicate that T-c(M) can be described by a single exponential decay term, and so most probably also a(M). Incorporation of these terms into the model enables the creation of realistic three-dimensional maps of the relative stiffness-temperature-moisture relationship at and in the neighborhood of the glass transition region. In principle, the same method can also be used to describe the effect of plasticizers other than water if their influence on T-c and the steepness parameter can be formulated as an algebraic expression.",,"PELEG, M (reprint author), UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT FOOD SCI,AMHERST,MA 01003, USA.",,,,,,,15,53,53,0,14,DR DIETRICH STEINKOPFF VERLAG,BERLIN 33,"C/O SPRINGER-VERLAG, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, 1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY",0035-4511,,,RHEOL ACTA,Rheol.

Yet the majority of these parameters did not allow a clear decision. Only the correlation between implant and tissue provided some interesting hints: Since bone cement guarantees immediate primary stability it is qualified especially for anchoring endoprostheses in patients who will put weight on their artificial joint right after the implantation. A fixation without bone cement could be favoured if new formation and preservation of bone have priority over primary stability. From this derives the following recommendation for practical purposes: Endoprosthetic components should be anchored without cement in patients younger than 70 and in revisions, while bone cement may be used in patients over the age 70.",,"WILLERT, HG (reprint author), UNIV GOTTINGEN,ORTHOPAD KLIN,ROBERT KOCH STR 40,D-37075 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,3,3,0,0,FERDINAND ENKE VERLAG,STUTTGART,"POSTFACH 30 03 66, D-70443 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0044-3220,,,Z ORTHOP GRENZGEB,Z.

Ultimate bond strength (UBS) in carbon fiber/polysulfone (CF/PSF) and polyaramid/polysulfone (K49/PSF) was previously reported to be significantly decreased in two simulated in vivo environments. While UBS is a useful parameter, for orthopedic implant applications the fatigue behavior of the interface is probably a more relevant indicator of long-term composite material performance. In this article, the effects of simulated in vivo environments (saline, exudate) upon the fatigue behavior of the interface of CF/PSF and K49/PSF are reported. The fatigue behavior of both material combinations was linearly dependent on the logarithm of fatigue fife in the dry (control), saline, and exudate environments. Testing either material in saline and exudate resulted in significantly lower fatigue strength than in the dry environment; however, results in the two wet environments were indistinguishable. The CF/PSF interface experienced fatigue failure at approximately 10(5) load cycles at a maximum applied load level of only 15% of its ultimate dry bond strength without indication of an endurance limit being reached. These results raise some important questions regarding the durability of CF/PSF composite in load bearing orthopedic applications.

In this hypothesis, the growth factors and bone cells are involved in the mechanim as follows: first osteoclasts activate the growth factors contained in the bone matrix and release them into bone fluid, then the growth factors are transported to the bone surface with fluid flow induced by the mechanical loads applied to the bone, and finally the growth factors transported regulate the activities of osteoblasts which are responsible for bone formation.

As compared with unimpregnated pieces, the adherence of bacteria significantly decreased to phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces that were either unimplanted or implanted for 2 days, but not for 7 days. The supplementation of albumin in the medium reduced the adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, unimpregnated drain pieces, but did not further decrease adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, phospholipid-impregnated brain pieces. Bacterial growth was inhibited after incubation in nutrient broth supplemented with phospholipids. The incidence of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal drain implantation did not differ between phospholipid-impregnated and unimpregnated drain pieces. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a large amount of biofilm and fibrous deposition on the surface of the implanted, phospholipid-impregnated rubber drain pieces. Thus, phospholipid impregnation of rubber drains reduces bacterial adherence and inhibits bacterial growth, without influencing the incidence of bacterial translocation.","LUND UNIV,DEPT SURG,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,ELECTRON MICROSCOPY UNIT,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN; LUND UNIV,DEPT MED MICROBIOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,"Bengmark, Stig/0000-0003-1809-8889",,,,21,11,11,0,1,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0300-9130,,,RES EXP MED,Res.

In a canine ex vivo series shunt experiment, very low platelet deposition was observed on these materials and those platelets which were adherent remained unspread. In contrast to this, large amounts of fibrinogen, of the order of a monolayer or greater, were deposited on these surfaces in this ex vivo experiment. This led to the hypothesis that perhaps the deposited fibrinogen did not retain its platelet-adhesive activity. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that these materials exert their antithrombotic effects through the adsorbed protein layer. Protein adsorption kinetics and isotherms on these sulphonated polyurethanes are determined. Multilayer protein adsorption or absorption into the hydrogel-like materials is found for each of the proteins studied, and the greatest amounts of protein are seen on the most highly sulphonated polyurethanes. Further, the blood-contacting response of these materials is investigated after pre-conditioning with either fibrinogen, fibronectin or albumin. When these materials are pre-adsorbed with either fibrinogen or fibronectin, a very thrombogenic response was observed, which suggests that the platelet-adhesive activity of these proteins is not being reduced. Pre-adsorption of albumin did not improve the thromboresistance of these surfaces.","UNIV DELAWARE,COLL ENGN,NEWARK,DE 19716; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-24046, HL-47179]",,,37,15,15,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,SEP,1993.0,14,11,,,,,834,844,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90005-M,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,LX408,WOS:A1993LX40800005,8218737.0,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro evaluation can be performed in the presence of human serum by means of techniques described in the literature and reviewed in this paper. Certain physical and chemical parameters involved in complement activation by materials have to be assessed: the chemical composition of the surface, surface area in contact with serum, temperature and duration of contact, and ionic environment with emphasis on divalent ions. Concerning materials evaluation, the adsorption of complement proteins or protein fragments has to be determined in addition to activation. Following screening tests using CH50 determination, activation of both classical and alternative pathways leading to formation of C3 convertases and formation of C5 convertase should be assessed. An example of the determination of the complement-activating capacity of two hydroxylated materials is presented and guidelines for in vitro evaluation are proposed.

Bacterial adhesion was quantified by adhesive coefficient, the percentage of bacteria transported to the surface that becomes adherent. The results showed that surface modification by adsorption of plasma proteins reduced the adhesion of S epidermidis as compared to the bare polymer surface. This surface modification was not sufficient to eliminate completely bacterial adhesion, even at the highest physiologic shear stress level. S epidermidis did adhere strongly to polyethylene surface modified by platelets. This is readily evident as approximately 50% of the adherent S epidermidis were bound to contact-activated platelets which occupied only 4% of the surface area. Adhesive coefficients to platelets were significantly greater than to the protein-adsorbed polyethylene surface by at least one order of magnitude (P less-than-or-equal-to .01) across the range of physiological shear conditions investigated. These studies show that it is biologic surface modification by contact-activated platelets, and not plasma proteins, which mediates S epidermidis adhesion to polyethylene.

Because most polymeric biomaterials accumulate a surface layer of protein immediately after implantation, these adverse reactions may stem from secondary interactions between the host and this surface layer of adsorbed proteins. Using polyester terephthalate (the polymer from which both Dacron and Mylar are produced) as a model, we have explored the hypothesis that surface-adsorbed immunoglobulin might mediate subsequent inflammatory responses. We find, as have others, that immunoglobulin G (IgG) does spontaneously adsorb to polymer surfaces, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, polymer implants precoated with IgG do activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in vitro and also attract substantial numbers of phagocytes (especially polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages) when implanted in mice. However, when implants are placed in mice having a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (and, consequently, almost undetectable levels of serum IgG), a near-normal influx of phagocytic cells ensues. Thus, spontaneously-adsorbed surface IgG does not appear to be o necessary precedent to inflammatory responses directed against implanted biomaterials.","ALBANY MED COLL,DIV EXPTL PATHOL A81,47 NEW SCOTLAND AVE,ALBANY,NY 12208; UNIV MINNESOTA,GRAD PROGRAM BIOMED ENGN,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; UNIV MINNESOTA,DIGHT LABS,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455; CHILDRENS HOSP OAKLAND,RES INST,OAKLAND,CA",,,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI25008],,,45,110,110,0,5,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-2143,,,J LAB CLIN MED,J.

Shot-peening has been applied to biomaterials (especially titanium and its alloys) to improve their fatigue strength. It is well known that shot-peening causes surface roughening. The effects of surface roughness on wettability are not well documented. Therefore, in the present study, the effects of shot peening on the initial contact angle and changes in it as a function of time, were investigated. In addition, the spontaneous half-cell potential of all tested biomaterials were measured to correlate the wettability phenomenon to initial surface chemistry. Pure titanium and its alloys, including Ti-6Al-4V and NiTi alloys, AISI Type 316L stainless, Co-Cr alloy, and pure nickel, were mechanically polished, shot-peened and pre-oxidized at 300-degrees-C for 30 min in pure oxygen. It was found that (i) shot-peening homogenized the surface conditions in terms of initial contact angles, (ii) TiO2 oxide shows a higher spreading coefficient, while cubic structure oxides show a lower value, and (iii) the spreading coefficient was correlated to the magnitude of the spontaneous half-cell potential.","BAYLOR COLL DENT,DEPT ORTHODONT,DALLAS,TX 75246; UNIV TSUKUBA,INST MAT SCI,TSUKUBA,IBARAKI 305,JAPAN; MET IMPROVEMENT CO,CTR RES & DEV,PARAMUS,NJ 07652","OSHIDA, Y (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,SCH DENT,DEPT DENT MAT,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202, USA.",,"Miyazaki, Shuichi/A-3113-2012","Miyazaki, Shuichi/0000-0003-3849-4176",,,,19,23,23,0,10,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The lectin Ulex europaeus I (UEA I) has a high affinity for human vascular endothelial cell surface glycoconjugates. Methods: UEA I was covalently bound to polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) with the cross-linking agent 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride to achieve oligosaccharide-mediated endothelial cell attachment to this otherwise nonadherent surface. Results: Experiments with radiolabeled UEA I demonstrated covalent linkage of as much as 1.35 mug/cm2. The lectin binding site is available after the reaction, as demonstrated in experiments a neoglycoprotein. Adhesion studies reveal a 100-fold increase in endothelial cell attachment for the UEA I/polyethylene terephthalate surface (99.7 +/- 29.6 cells/high-power field) when compared with untreated (0.7 +/- 0.5), crosslinking agent (0.4 +/- 0.3), and denatured UEA 1 (1.2 +/- 1. 1) control groups. Five vascular endothelial cell lines adhered to the UEA I/polyethylene terephthalate surface, whereas monocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts did not. Conclusion: These results imply new strategies for endothelialization of prosthetic grafts and promotion of selective cell adherence to biomaterials, with emphasis on carbohydrate interactions. Moreover, this experimental system offers a model for exploring the biologic significance of the endothelial cell-UEA I ligand.",,"OZAKI, CK (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV, NEW ENGLAND DEACONESS HOSP, SCH MED, 21-27 BURLINGTON AVE, ROOM 512, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA.",,"Ozaki, C Keith/A-4937-2013",,NHLBI NIH HHS [HL08730],,,90,8,10,0,1,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

Removal of gas nuclei (denucleation) increases the available surface area of biomaterials for modification and/or cell adhesion, while adhesion molecules provide specific attachment sites. Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) were isolated from fat, fluorescently labeled, and allowed to settle onto expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular patches. Patch treatments included fibronectin alone (F), gas denucleation followed by fibronectin (D/F), denucleation followed by the surfactant tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC) (D/T), denucleation followed by TDMAC followed by fibronectin (D/T/F), or denucleation followed by TDMAC followed by a synthetic polymer with numerous arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequences (D/T/R). After 1 h of incubation, the 45 mm2 patch area covered with microvascular endothelial cells was assessed using computer-aided fluorescence microscopy. Initial graft coverage with D/T (26.2 +/- 2.4 mm2) and D/T/F (25.9 +/- 2.1 mm2) was better than with F (16.8 +/- 2.5 mm) (P < .05). Patches were then exposed to a detachment stress and coverage was again measured. Following stress, coverage was greater with D/T (20.7 +/- 3.4 mm2) and D/T/F (20.7 +/- 2.0 mm2) than with D/T/R (8.4 +/- 1.8 mm2) or F (3.6 +/- 0.9 mm2) (P < .001). Percent retention of cells following stress was better with D/T and D/T/F than with D/T/R, D/F, or F (P < .0001). Scanning electron micrographs were consistent with the qualitative findings. The results indicate that TDMAC alone or with fibronectin increases adhesion of human microvascular endothelial cells to denucleated ePTFE.

In the course of the inflammatory response, the cellular activation triggers expression of a number of enzymes, such as 5'-nucleotidase, which is widely distributed in animal cell membranes as an ectoenzyme. It is now well established that 5'-nucleotidase activity decreases following the contact of inflammatory cells with foreign particles. In this paper we investigate a possible correlation between the enzymatic activities and the dynamic properties of the cell membrane bilayer. Dacron pieces were introduced into rats' peritoneal cavities for a period of 6 h, after which the peritoneal cells were harvested, and various enzyme assays performed, including those for cytoplasmic, lysosomal, and ectoenzymes. In parallel, we studied cell membrane fluidity, using fluorescence polarization of 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH), and cellular ultrastructural alteration resulting from the cell-biomaterial interactions using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Our results show that: 1) macrophages spread around the Dacron fibers with cytoplasmic finger-like projections, but no phagolysosomes, 2) 5'-nucleotidase levels decrease with surgical trauma in comparison with the resident cell exudate, 3) implantation of biomaterials slightly modify the 5'-nucleotidase levels observed in the sham animal, 4) no differences in the anisotropy values indicating that membrane lipid order within the cells could not account for the observed decrease of 5'-nucleotidase activity. Thus, we can suggest that 5'-nucleotidase expression may reflect a particular feature of cell activation without a phagocytic process.

These claims were tested in a cooperative multicenter prospective study of 2,493 inguinal hernia repairs. This study was done to examine the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in primary and recurrent inguinal hernia repaired with synthetic biomaterials. Clinical signs and symptoms of wound infection and the results of each infected repair are reported. The rate of infection was about 1 percent, whether or not biomaterials or antibiotics were used. More than 70 percent of wound infections occurred in patients 60 years of age or older. Removal of biomaterials from the infected wounds was not necessary and generally is not recommended. Recurrence has not occurred in any of the infected repairs. With or without prosthetic repair, the treatment of infected inguinal hernia wounds was relatively simple, of reasonable cost and concluded with a good result.

Here we report the controlled formation of tubular inorganic-organic composites by using self-assembled lipid tubules as templates for the crystallization of inorganic oxides. We use microstructures formed by a sugar-based lipid galactocerebroside, doped with small amounts of an anionic sulphated derivative, to induce nucleation of magnetic and non-magnetic iron oxides. By varying the reaction conditions, we can create either tube-like or lamellar disk-like composites.

The substrate properties of the bilayers for human and rat epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were assessed. Keratinocytes attached and expanded into confluent sheets on both the routine cell culture plastic (TCPS) and the experimental substrates. Morphology of the cells cultured on the biomaterials was found to be comparable with the morphology of those grown on TCPS. In contrast to dense films, porous PEO:PBT copolymer and PLLA appeared poor substrates for fibroblasts. Long-term (in vivo) degradation of the biomaterials was mimicked in vitro to screen the biomaterials for any release of toxic substances.

These procedures consisted of electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis and contact angle characterization surface studies, and protein adsorption, cell culture cytotoxicity, clotting time and haemolysis biocompatibility testing. The polyimide surfaces were invariant from the bulk composition with 60-80% C, 10-20% O and 2-5% N, producing advancing contact angles in the hydrophobic range (80-1000). Consequently, they adsorbed significant amounts of albumin (2-3 mug/cm2) and fibrinogen (0.5-0.8 mug/cm2). The polyimides also displayed an insignificant level of cytotoxicity and haemolysis, and clotting times ranged from 63 to 98% of normal. These clotting times and haemolytic index values were intermediate between the values observed for Teflon(R) and Silastic(R) controls. These factors, along with the strong adherence of polyimides to metal oxide substrates, indicate that polyimide materials are good candidates for further testing as encapsulants for implantable biosensors.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT BIOMED ENGN, DURHAM, NC 27706 USA",,,,,,,,29,206,221,2,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUL,1993.0,14,8,,,,,627,635,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90183-3,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,LL696,WOS:A1993LL69600013,8399958.0,,,,2019-02-25

Insoluble polystyrene derivatives bearing isolated sulphonate groups (PSSO3) deplete complement, whereas identical surfaces substituted with both sulphonate and hydroxymethyl groups (PSCH2OH-SO3) are non-activators. Polystyrene sulphonate derivatives possess high adsorptive properties, particularly for serine proteases of the coagulation cascade. Thus, we studied the interactions between polystyrene derivatives and factor D, an enzyme essential for AP activation. C3 was activated when normal human serum (NHS) was incubated with PSSO3, whereas PSCH2OH-SO3 did not induce any specific C3 activation. Both polymers adsorbed factor D from serum, as shown by the loss of haemolytic factor D from NHS incubated with the polymers and by the specific adsorption of radiolabelled factor D. When bound to the polymers, factor D was not functional. The disappearance of factor D was in contradiction to the observed complement activation induced by PSSO3. When other AP components were studied, it was evident that PSSO3 adsorbed factor H even more rapidly and efficiently than factor D. Thus, the net effect was an immediate deregulation of the AP resulting in C3 activation, followed by inhibition of the AP when factor D was finally depleted. Pre-exposure of PSSO3 to NHS prevented any complement activation because the polymer was saturated with factor H, but still adsorbed factor D. Such properties could be beneficial during haemodialysis with membranes for uremic patients who have increased levels of factor D in their serum.","UNIV PARIS 13, RECH MACROMOLEC LAB, CNRS, URA 502, F-93430 VILLETANEUSE, FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 11, CNRS, URA 1218, F-92290 CHATENAY MALABRY, FRANCE","PASCUAL, M (reprint author), UNIV GENEVA, CTR MED, IMMUNONEPHROL LAB 5222, 1 RUE MICHEL SERVET, CH-1211 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,24,18,18,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,JUL,1993.0,14,9,,,,,665,670,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90065-A,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,LQ251,WOS:A1993LQ25100004,8399963.0,,,,2019-02-25

Table 1 lists the sequence of these events following injury. From the biomaterials perspective, placement of a biomaterial in the in vivo environment involves injection, insertion, or surgical implantation, all of which injure the tissues or organs involved (1,2). The implantation procedure initiates a response to injury, and mechanisms are activated to produce healing (3,4). The degree to which the homeostatic mechanisms are perturbed and the extent of pathophysiologic responses and their resolution are measures of the host reactions to the biomaterial, and they may ultimately determine its biocompatibility and its success or failure as a device or prosthesis. Although it is convenient to consider blood-material interactions separately from tissue-material interactions, it should be kept in mind that the mechanisms involved in both sets of interactions involve both blood and tissue. Furthermore, host reactions are tissue dependent, organ dependent, and species dependent. Obviously, the extent of injury varies depending on the implantation procedure.

The primary focus, therefore, is on surface chemical composition, which can vary instantaneously with processing conditions and environmental changes. The relevance of blood compatibility testing is dependent on the control of applicable variables and an understanding of the state of the biomaterial at the time of testing. An appropriate fabrication protocol includes rigorous planning for and execution of quality control measures in collaboration with those who will design, run, and interpret the actual tests. Adequate documentation, quality monitoring, operator training, and safe laboratory practices contribute to a valid test outcome. Controllable environmental variables include air composition and flow, light composition and intensity, temperature, electrostatic charge, and particulates. To minimize particulate contamination, handling and processing of biomaterials should take place in clean spaces. Substrate effects involving the contact of biomaterials with processing tools, handling implements, or packaging materials must be controlled to minimize mechanical damage or the transfer of contaminants to test specimens. In preparing the test specimen, different primary fabrication processes and subsequent treatments can produce widely divergent properties in the same biomaterial. Therefore a detailed understanding of the physical and chemical consequences of the chosen process (e.g., thermal, solution, reactive, mechanical) is necessary. Secondary procedures such as cleaning, extraction, surface modification, prehydration, and storage will affect important surface and bulk properties of the biomaterial.

A range of physical and biological properties must be evaluated along with the materials' processability in order to fabricate an economical, safe, and effective device. The materials used in cardiovascular devices include a broad range of commercially available materials; however, these materials must meet stringent requirements to be acceptable for use in the body. Specifically, these biomaterials include synthetic polymers, biodegradable polymers, biologically derived materials, bioderived macromolecules, passive coatings, bioactive coatings, tissue adhesives, metal alloys, ceramics, and carbons. Applications for these blood-contacting materials include extracorporeal devices, catheters, and tubing devices, which are inserted into a blood vessel, or permanently implanted devices. In the most basic sense, the materials constituting the device, as fabricated and sterilized, must be nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, nonantigenic, and nonmutagenic. Implanted devices impose a new set of requirements, both biologically and from a materials viewpoint. The effect of a foreign body in the cardiovascular system essentially involves the study of thrombosis and wound healing in the presence of a sterile foreign material in flowing blood. The outcome of this healing process can have profound implications for the success of a device and can be dependent on material properties. The durability of the device will be determined by its fatigue resistance and its resistance to biodegradation. Designs will be increasingly scrutinized for durability by regulatory agencies. Each class of biomaterial for cardiovascular applications is categorized by the material properties. The biologic and physical criteria need to be evaluated in the context of the entire device, its application and duration of use, and how it interfaces with the body.","UNIV TEXAS, DEPT CHEM ENGN, AUSTIN, TX 78712 USA","HELMUS, MN (reprint author), SCHNEIDER USA INC, PFIZER HOSP PROD GRP, 5905 NATHAN LANE, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55442 USA.",,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",,,,62,20,21,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1054-8807,1879-1336,,CARDIOVASC PATHOL,Cardiovasc.

For example, such interactions contribute to anastomotic hyperplasia following insertion of small caliber vascular prostheses and hyperplasia following insertion of intravascular stents. Blood-tissue interactions also probably contribute to restenosis following balloon or other types of angioplasty, saphenous vein bypass grafting, and the accelerated arteriosclerosis that complicates solid organ transplantation. Despite the diverse nature of the inciting interventions, common pathobiological mechanisms may contribute to these tissue reactions. Signals arising from interactions between biomaterials and soluble or formed blood elements can modulate the functions of the cells that comprise the blood vessel wall. In many instances, altered endothelial function may play a primary or contributory role in vascular lesion formation. Migration and inappropriate proliferation of smooth muscle cells also commonly occur during reactions of blood vessels to interventional therapies. Increased accumulation of extracellular matrix materials and, sometimes, remodeling of this matrix often accompany smooth muscle migration and proliferation and participate in the formation of these vascular lesions. Such altered functions of vascular walls and their interactions with blood elements, including the coagulation system, platelets, and leukocytes, contribute to both initiation and progression of vascular lesions produced by cardiovascular interventions. Late in the natural history of these lesions, complications may arise that can yield significant clinical manifestations. Such complications include fissuring, rupture, ulceration, thrombosis and embolism, calcification of lesions and prosthetic devices, microvascular hemorrhage, and aneurysmal dilatation of vessels. These late complications often involve altered vascular cell functions related to interaction with soluble or formed elements of the blood and, when present, implanted biomaterials.","HARVARD UNIV, SCH MED, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA","LIBBY, P (reprint author), BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP, VASC MED & ATHEROSCLEROSIS UNIT, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA.",,,,,,,50,1,1,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1054-8807,1879-1336,,CARDIOVASC PATHOL,Cardiovasc.

The reagents, systems, and technologies are therefore available for a ''reductionist'' approach to the roles of cell adhesion in processes such as the interaction of blood with biomedical materials. Key to the success of this approach is the recognition that the same molecules or families of molecules are responsible for many different processes in organisms that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years. For instance, the alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin receptor that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation and is defective in Glanzmann thrombasthenia in humans is very similar to the receptor that mediates muscle attachment and is defective in fruitflies with the myospheriod phenotype. The challenges to the field of cell adhesion are to understand the events that control the activities of adhesion receptors and ligands, the signals that emanate from ligated receptors, and how the signals are processed to influence behavior when cells encounter surfaces or other cells. To exemplify these issues, this chapter focuses on the alpha(v)beta3 integrin receptor, an adhesive ligand for the receptor, vitronectin; and modulation of cellular adhesion to vitronectin by high-molecular-weight kininogen.

This chapter emphasizes interactions in the blood path, although it is recognized that any device that has contact with internal organs or tissues has contact either directly or indirectly with the blood path. Advances have been made in the evaluation of devices and materials for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The principal methods for cytotoxicity, i.e., direct contact, extract dilution, and agar diffusion assays, have been employed extensively throughout industry, government, and academia. They have been developed into standard methods in developed countries and by international organizations. Future directions will entail refinement of these assays, newer automated methods, and improvements in the understanding and hazard assessment of target cell toxicity. Genotoxicity tests, including mutagenicity and clastogenicity, have had widespread applications in testing pure chemicals. Although the methods have been developed into international standards, there are many deviations and uncertainties in the applications of these standards and the interpretation of data. In particular, there is considerable confusion about the use of these methods for complex mixtures including the extractables from medical devices. There is no convincing evidence that long-term human clinical use of bioprosthetic or prosthetic devices has resulted in irreversible genotoxic effects.

Results indicated that the HA coating on Ti6AI4V lost bond strength when exposed to either a high (>95%) or low (<30%) humidity environment.

These results show that simple biologic assays, such as cell colonization, are not able to distinguish between differences in surface chemistry demonstrated by such a routinely employed surface analysis technique. Thus, there is a need to develop more sensitive biologic assays that provide functional information of a precision that can be correlated with subtle changes in substratum surface chemistry.

For bone repair, their specific function would be to support osteoblast growth, forming a bone-polymer matrix. MC3T3-E1 cells (an osteogenic cell line) were seeded onto polymer matrices and cell adhesion and growth as well as polymer degradation were examined. Both imidazolyl- and ethyl glycinato-substituted polyphosphazenes supported the growth of MC3T3-E1 cells. An increase in the content of the imidazolyl side group resulted in a reduction in cell attachment and growth on the polymer surface and an increase in the rate of degradation of the polymer. In contrast, substitution with the ethyl glycinato group favored increased cell adhesion and growth and also an increase in the rate of degradation of the polymers. Thus, the polyphosphazenes represent a system whereby cell growth and degradation can be modulated by varying the nature of the hydrolytically unstable side chain. This in vitro evaluation suggests that the polyphosphazenes may be suitable candidate biomaterials for the construction of a cell-polymer matrix for tissue regeneration.","HARVARD UNIV,MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP,SCH MED,DEPT ORTHOPED SURG,BOSTON,MA 02114; PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,UNIV PK,PA 16802","LAURENCIN, CT (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV,MIT,DIV HLTH SCI & TECHNOL,ROOM 141,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139, USA.",,,"Marlow, Maria/0000-0002-0333-5290; Elgendy, Hoda/0000-0002-5573-7419",,,,29,117,122,0,8,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

New methods for tethering DNA molecules to substrates have yielded many excellent AFM images of DNA, even under water. The highest resolution has been obtained with specially sharpened tips, but recent work suggests that this may not be necessary. Control of contamination, and tip-sample interactions (i.e., adhesion) are also important factors. We describe a scheme of magnetic control of AFM cantilevers which should overcome the mechanical instability that places a lower limit on contact force. This should permit active control of interaction forces with the instrument operated in water. We illustrate local force measurements made under water with examples of the measurements of the microelastic properties of bone and of the electrostatic interactions between pairs of colloidal particles. The STM has been used to image small DNA oligomers on a gold electrode in water at high resolution. STM images of DNA bases show that the purines form stacked aggregates with the same base-stacked structure as found in DNA. There is evidence of a connection between the macroscopically measured electrochemical properties of thymine and its STM contrast.

Wettability, observed in the laboratory, may reflect an important in vivo property: the rapidity for extracellular fluids and blood cells to invade the graft and carry bone forming cells.

After two weeks in culture, light- and fluorescence-microscopic and SEM studies revealed significant differences in cell growth. Maximum compatibility was shown by the hydroxyapatite specimen. In the case of commercially pure titanium we found somewhat decreased biocompatibility. Polyethylene was associated with distinct signs of cytotoxicity.

Kinetic profiles of the double-layer capacitance and the polarization resistance were constructed from multiple in vitro and in vivo EIS measurements performed over 60 min at 0 V (reference Ag/AgCI) conditioning potential. The profiles demonstrated that the growth of surface oxides was biphasic, with rapid decrease in the double-layer capacitance occurring within 20 min and reaching steady-state conditions at approximately 40 min.

The biocompatibility of one of the materials most commonly used in the fabrication of xenograft heart valves, bovine pericardium, treated with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde is assessed comparison to a synthetic material, Dacron(R) tricot. An in vitro tissue culture assay, by the agar overlay method, using RC-IAL and Hela cell lines, was applied to treated pericardium and attested the intense toxicity of the treating agents. The subcutaneous grafting of treated pericardium and Dacron(R) was carried out in Wistar rats of 1 to 3 months of age. After the use of the usual histological methods. an evaluation of hematoxylin-eosin stained specimens demonstrated an absence of histocompatibility, mainly as regards for the formaldehyde treated pericardium. Comparatively, the evaluation of implanted Dacron(R) confirmed its perfect biocompatibility. In conclusion, some improvement in xenograft heart valves is necessary, before the surgical implantation procedure takes place.","ESCOLA PAULISTA MED,DEPT MORFOL,BR-04023 SAO PAULO,BRAZIL","PINTO, TDJA (reprint author), UNIV SAO PAULO,FAC CIENCIAS FARM,DEPT FARM,CAIXA POSTAL 30786,BR-05340901 SAO PAULO,BRAZIL.",,,,,,,13,1,3,0,3,REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA,SAO PAULO,"FACULDADE SAUDE PUBL DA USP, AV DR ARNALDO 715, 01255 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",0034-8910,,,REV SAUDE PUBL,Rev.

Using supercritical propane, a parent EVAc sample (M(n) = 70 kDa, M(w)/M(n) = 2.4) was separated into narrow fractions with a range of molecular weights (8.7 < M(n) < 165 kDa, 1.4 < M(w)/M(n) < 1.7). Solid particles of Ab were dispersed in matrices composed of different polymer fractions and the rate of Ab release into buffered saline was measured. The rate of Ab release from the EVAc matrix depended on molecular weight: > 90% of the incorporated Ab was released from low molecular weight fractions (M(n) < 40 kDa) during the first 5 days of release, while < 10% was released from the high molecular weight fraction (M(n) > 160 kDa) during 14 days of release. No significant differences in polymer composition, glass-transition temperature, or crystallinity were identified in the different molecular weight fractions of EVAc. Mechanical properties of the polymer did depend on the molecular weight distribution, and correlated directly with Ab release rates. Because it permits rapid and reproducible fractionation of polymers, supercritical fluid extraction can be used to modify the performance of polymeric biomaterials.","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,BALTIMORE,MD 21218","SALTZMAN, WM (reprint author), JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BALTIMORE,MD 21218, USA.",,,,,,,41,35,35,1,8,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-8995,,,J APPL POLYM SCI,J.

After removal of inflammatory tissue the surgeon may be confronted with the need to reconstruct the ossicular chain. Apart from homologous ossicles, implants of different materials have been used for this purpose but often without finding the best solution for the problem encountered. As such, we implanted pieces of human dentin and enamel into the middle ears and mandibles of guinea pigs. After staged placements of the grafts in the animal hosts, specimens were removed and prepared for morphological evaluation by embedding in acrylic without prior decalcification. In a mobile unloaded position within the middle ears, implanted specimens were covered by mucosa and showed no evidence for fibrosis or fixation. A joint-like connection to the bony capsule of the middle ear develops as necessary for a type III tympanoplasty. In a mobile, loaded site with contact to bone, implants were surrounded by connective tissue. In connection with the mucosal envelope, this finding confirms the suitability of the materials for ossiculoplasty. When stable within the mandible, implants were surrounded by new bone formation that originated from the host's tissue only, indicating a favorable result for the obliteration of a mastoid cavity. On the surface of both biomaterials, a cell-mediated resorption could be detected, which was more significant in the mandibular site than in the middle ear. However, the long-term biostability of dentin and enamel seems questionable. The synthetic material hydroxyapatite proved less susceptible to biodegradation when tested under identical conditions in a previous experiment. Apart from this aspect, a tissue reaction similar to that seen with dentin and enamel was encountered with hydroxyapatite in equivalent implantation sites. These findings indicate that hydroxyapatite is a more suitable material for ossiculoplasty.",,"BERNECKER, F (reprint author), KLINIKUM KAISERSLAUTERN,HNO KLIN,FRIEDRICH ENGLELS STR 25,W-6750 KAISERSLAUTERN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0017-6192,,,HNO,HNO,MAY,1993.0,41,5,,,,,250,253,,,,,,4,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,LH654,WOS:A1993LH65400004,8335486.0,,,,2019-02-25

Three weeks after intraperitoneal implantation, the materials were completely encapsulated and the morphological aberration of the peritoneum and spleen disappeared.

Because these receptors are used in normal in vivo hemostatic adhesion, they may also have a role for adhesion onto synthetic surfaces in the vasculature. Platelet adhesion in vitro was examined onto Formvar, glass, and four polyurethaneureas with various soft segment chemistries and surface properties. Platelets were pretreated with RGD peptides before and after adhesion. RGD peptide pretreatment inhibited spreading and close contact formation compared to treatment with saline or control RGE peptides, with no observable effect on the number of adherent platelets per area. High-voltage electron microscopy showed abnormally sparse and short microfilament structures with RGD peptide treatment, suggesting an indirect inhibition of actin filament formation. Video-enhanced light microscopy showed a cessation of spreading and a partial reversal of close contacts following RGD peptide application to adherent platelets. Because minimal amounts of plasma proteins are present in column-washed platelet suspensions, and as platelet secretion appeared to be minimal in these experiments, these observations suggest that RGD binding integrin receptors may function in platelet spreading even in the absence of exogenous ligand. As RGD peptides did not affect the numbers of adherent platelets, while producing substantial decreases in the extent of spreading, we suggest that platelet integrins, possibly GPIIb-IIIa, are involved in spreading on synthetic Surfaces but not for initial adhesion.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT BIOMED SCI, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV DELAWARE, COLL ENGN, NEWARK, DE 19716 USA","GOODMAN, SL (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ANIM HLTH, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.",,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-570]; NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-37351, HL-29586]",,,63,42,42,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

From day 7 after implantation, osteoblast-like cells were visible with thin layers of new bone on both biomaterials. Histomorphometry showed progressive increase in volume and surface of newly formed bone. Signs of cell-dependent resorption were visible at the surface of biomaterials and newly formed bone. There was a progressive decrease in relative volume and trabecular thickness of the biomaterials. Resorption of biomaterials appears to involve two cell types: multinucleated giant cells and osteoclast-like cells. The multinucleated giant cells observed had neither tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP) nor a ruffled border. Vesicles and vacuoles containing crystals observed in these cells suggest phagocytosis of biomaterials. The number of these cells decreased after day 14 following implantation. The osteoclast-like cells were TRAP positive. The structured modification and the TRAP activity demonstrated in the subjacent biomaterial suggest that the dissolution of the implant may be associated to an extracellular enzymatic activity of these cells. Electron microscopy revealed a clear zone and cytoplasmic membrane infolding in these cells, suggesting a ruffled border differentiation. The number of these cells increased with delay after implantation. It was concluded that the implantation of calcium phosphate ceramics in bone leads to new bone formation as well as to resorption of the biomaterials. The mechanism of resorption appears to associate crystal endocytosis by multinucleated giant cells and more classical resorption by osteoclast-like cells.","FAC CHIRURG DENTAIRE, RECH TISSUS CALCIFIES & BIOMAT LAB, F-44042 NANTES 01, FRANCE; UNIV ANGERS, SERV COMMUN MICROSCOPIE ELECTRON, F-49045 ANGERS, FRANCE","BASLE, MF (reprint author), FAC MED ANGERS, HISTOL & EMBRYOL LAB, ETUDE & RECH TISSU OSSEUX GRP, RUE HAUTE RECULEE, F-49045 ANGERS, FRANCE.",,"Daculsi, Guy/P-1320-2014","Daculsi, Guy/0000-0003-1030-3446",,,,62,31,31,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-4530,1573-4838,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

Other films were allowed to incubate for 4 more days in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum without cells to assess BAEC proliferation. The assay was performed on PEUU films modified with acrylate and methacrylate polymer and copolymer additives that spanned a wide range on the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity scale. Tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) was used as a control. The assay showed that PEUU films loaded with Methacrol 2138F [copoly(diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate [DI-PAM]/decyl methacrylate [DM]) (3/1)] or with its hydrophilic component, DIPAM, in homopolymer form (i.e., h-DIPAM), significantly enhanced BAEC attachment (approximately 80% of TCPS values) and proliferation (approximately 80%) when compared to unloaded PEUU films (attachment, 73%; proliferation, 47%) or to PEUU films loaded with the more hydrophobic acrylate or methacrylate polymer additives (attachment, 32-69%; proliferation, 18-57%). The assay also showed that PEUU films coated with homopoly(diisopropylaminoethyl acrylate) (h-DIPAA) significantly enhanced BAEC attachment and proliferation when compared to PEUU films coated with h-decyl acrylate (h-DA); films coated with the copolymer of these two acrylates (i.e., co-[DIPAA/DA] [3/1]) showed intermediate behavior. To explain the enhancement of BAEC interaction with films loaded with Methacrol 2138F or h-DIPAM, when compared to unmodified PEUU films or to PEUU films loaded with more hydrophobic acrylate and methacrylate polymer additives, it was assumed that the additives near the surface region of the solvent swollen PEUU matrix may have migrated to, or near to, the PEUU-air interface during film formation, creating an additive enriched PEUU surface region. It is suggested that, once at this surface region, dynamic reorientation in response to an aqueous medium ensured the additives were able significantly to influence protein adsorption, and concomitant endothelial cell behavior, but only if they interacted with aqueous media more favorably than the PEUU. The ability of Methacrol and h-DIPAM additives to enhance endothelial cell behavior is argued to be the result of increased hydrophilicity. This is the result of exposed, hydrogen-bonding DIPAM moieties and increased surface flexibility, which is itself due to the hydration of unhindered Methacrol chains, which may create an additive enriched PEUU-water interfacial zone.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI, 10900 EUCLID AVE, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA; DUPONT CO, WAYNESBORO, VA 22980 USA; DUPONT CO, WILMINGTON, DE 19880 USA",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-25239, HL-33849]",,,45,7,7,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The effects of gas nuclei on patency and blood flow were studied in 4 mm diameter arterial grafts (Gore ePTFE; Johnson and Johnson Vita-graft ePTFE; Bard ACG EXS) in the femoropopliteal position of dogs. Control and denucleated (air-free) grafts were implanted bilaterally. Grafts were denucleated by immersion in degassed saline and exposure to 4 torr vacuum and 3,000-20,000 psig pressure. Graft patency was determined at harvest in 46 dogs. Blood flow was measured with acoustic flow probes in eight dogs. Denucleated graft patency was 60% after 2 days of implant while control patency was 22% (P < .05). Measured blood flow was higher in denucleated grafts than in control grafts (P < .02) in 4 of 5 dogs which had significantly different flows. Patency and flow decreased to zero for both control and denucleated grafts over periods of up to 80 days. Air in the control grafts may have been absorbed within several days, leading to late similarity with the denucleated grafts.

Protein adsorption experiments with PAPI-based additives showed that additive loaded PEUU formulations adsorbed significantly lower amounts of the studied proteins than did the unloaded PEUU. Protein adsorption to the DA and DIPAA endcapped PEUU films was found not to vary consistently from that of the unloaded PEUU film. Endothelial cell attachment and proliferation experiments with PAPI-DA and polyethylene glycol-PAPI-DA (PEG-PAPI-DA) loaded PEUU films showed that many of the films exhibited attachment and proliferation that was significantly enhanced compared to PEUU A' and that approached or equaled that of the tissue culture polystyrene control. Experiments with PAPI-DIPAA and PEG-PAPI-DIPAA loaded PEUU films exhibited attachment and proliferation data that was often below 10% of the tissue culture polystyrene control values. Experiments with the DA and DIPAA endcapped PEUU films showed endothelial cell attachment and proliferation that was statistically indistinguishable from the PEUU A' values. Contact angle analysis was carried out on the endcapped PEUU films, on the PAPI-based additive loaded PEUU films, and on PEUU A' using the sessile drop method. The advancing and receding contact angle behavior of the PAPI-based additive loaded PEUU films deviated markedly from the behavior of PEUU A', suggesting that the additives were present at the PEUU-water interface. The contact angle behavior of the endcapped PEUUs was similar to that of PEUU A', suggesting that the DA and DIPAA endcap moieties did not exist at the hydrated PEUU surface in appreciable quantities. To explain the differences in protein adsorption and endothelial cell behavior on the air side of additive loaded PEUUs when compared to the base PEUU, it was assumed that the additives near this region of the solvent swollen PEUU matrix may have migrated to, at, or near the PEUU-air interface during film formation, creating an additive enriched PEUU surface region. Once at this surface region, it was suggested that dynamic surface reorientation in response to an aqueous medium ensured that the additives with hydrophilic moieties (PEG-PAPI-DA, PEG-PAPI-DIPAA, PAPI-DIPAA) were significantly able to influence protein adsorption and endothelial cell behavior if they interacted with aqueous media more favorably than the PEUU. Furthermore, the additive without hydrophilic moieties (PAPI-DA) could influence protein adsorption and endothelial cell behavior only if it existed at the PEUU-air interface in such high concentrations that dynamic surface reorientation in response to an aqueous media would not be completely able to expose the more hydrophilic PEUU polymer chains.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI, 10900 EUCLID AVE, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, INST PATHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-33849, HL-25239]",,,32,14,14,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The present concept of a biocompatible material is one that elicits an appropriate host response in a specific application. To design optimal biomaterials, three interactive components should be considered: the chemical nature of the surface, the mediating pellicle layer, and microbial and host response. Surface chemistry determines which molecules are selectively adsorbed onto a surface from oral fluids. The pellicle-coated surface should be designed to elicit a more desirable host response. Pellicle composition can be altered by chemically changing the surface, precoating surfaces with biological molecules, or using synthetic materials designed to mimic natural tissues. Several surface-sensitive techniques are available to assess these modifications, including vibrational spectroscopy, electron microscopy for chemical analysis, and bioanalytical methods. To develop more biocompatible materials, a further understanding of pellicle formation as a function of surface composition, microbial adhesion to biomaterials, and cellular reaction to implant biomaterials is necessary. This knowledge will facilitate development of new biologically based rationales for treatment modalities in restorative dentistry.","SUNY BUFFALO,SCH DENT MED,DEPT ORAL BIOL,BUFFALO,NY 14214","EDGERTON, M (reprint author), SUNY BUFFALO,SCH DENT MED,DEPT REMOVABLE PROSTHODONT & ORAL BIOL,BUFFALO,NY 14214, USA.",,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE07585, DE00213, DE09931]",,,95,16,17,0,4,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-3913,,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

The influence of fusidic acid on these 3 factors was studied by using 3 pairs of pathogenic strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Each pair presented differences in the expression of one or several of these factors. The influence of fusidic acid was initially studied by determining the expression of these factors by these strains cultured in the presence of 0.03 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l of antibiotic. Hydrophobicity was measured by the Bath-test method, slime was detected by Trypan blue staining after fixation with Carnov's fixative and adherence was determined on polystvrene. The variations observed were generally minor, except for S. epidermidis, high slime produces, which showed a reduced production. Using this collection of strains, we then selected mutants resistant to 2 mug/ml of fusidic acid. This resistance induced a reduction in the 3 colonisation factors and it can be proposed that strains resistant to fusidic acid have a lesser capacity to colonise than sensitive strains. The bacteria adhere to and colonise the majority of surfaces proposed to them [3, 7, 10]. This was the case for biomaterials used in medicine, whose number and diversity (catheters, prostheses) are continually increasing. Apart from thrombosis, the major complication is the development of infection. Coagulase positive or negative Staphvlococci are very frequently responsible for this type of infection. Two processes play a kev role in the colonisation and development of infection by Staphylococci : firstly, adhesion of the bacteria to the surface of the biomaterial, followed by production of slime, amorphous mucoid substance, essentially composed of polysaccharides, which protects the bacteria from the host's defences and from the action of antibiotics [1, 2, 8, 18]. Antibiotics can act on these two processes and limit the bacterial colonisation [4]. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic which inhibits the synthesis of proteins [9] and, at subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations, it may be able to modify the bacterial surface and adherence of Staphylococci as well as the production of slime. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of fusidic acid on the hydrophobicity of strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, their adherence to polystyrene and their production of slime. As it is possible to select in vitro strains resistant to fusidic acid, the authors also investigated whether such resistance induced a modification in these colonisation factors.","HOP G & R LAENNEC,SERV BACTERIOL B,F-44035 NANTES 01,FRANCE","DRUGEON, HB (reprint author), CERMIA,ROUTE PARC SOUVENIR,F-06500 MENTON,FRANCE.",,,,,,,18,1,1,0,1,EXPANSION SCI FRANCAISE,PARIS,"31 BLVD LATOUR MAUBOURG, 75007 PARIS, FRANCE",0369-8114,,,PATHOL BIOL,Pathol.

In contrast, erythrocytes attached by nonspecific hydrophobic interaction on uncoated polystyrene dishes assumed flat morphology and remained unperturbed by movements in the medium. The attachment to PVG substratum was suppressed by (1) GLUT-1 inhibitors such as phloretin, phloridzin, and cytochalasin B, and (2) PVG molecules in solution, and (3) at 4-degrees-C, suggesting that the specific recognition of high density of glucose on PVG and the dynamic movement of GLUT-1 are essential for the attachment.

Systems used were poly(ethylene oxide)/dextran/water and Ucon/dextran/water [Ucon being a random poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) copolymer]. The experiments involved the determination of the temperature and polymer concentration dependence on the partitioning. The theoretical results were obtained through a self-consistent mean-field lattice theory for multicomponent mixtures of copolymers with internal states in heterogeneous systems. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental findings show a qualitative agreement regarding the increased preference for the dextran-rich phase at increased polymer concentrations and the different temperature response displayed by the two systems. Furthermore, details about the temperature response, obtained from the model calculations, are discussed. The overall protein-polymer interaction was found to be repulsive and it is dominated by an entropic repulsion due to the restriction of possible polymer conformations for polymers close to the protein surface. The energetic contribution to the overall interaction is smaller in magnitude. It was repulsive for poly(ethylene oxide) and Ucon, whereas it was attractive for dextran for both proteins.",,"CARLSSON, M (reprint author), UNIV LUND,CTR CHEM,POB 124,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,29,30,30,2,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,MAR 29,1993.0,26,7,,,,,1546,1554,,10.1021/ma00059a010,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,KV509,WOS:A1993KV50900010,,,,,2019-02-25

On the other hand, biological biomaterials could be used to carry and deliver GFs to stimulate wound healing. In the present study, fibroblasts were cultivated in a serum-free culture medium onto collagen (type I), hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, fibronectin, or fibrin. FGF, EGF, or PDGF was incorporated within those substrates. Using immuno- and radiolabeling assays, the distribution of GFs within the ECM analogs was relatively uniform and GFs retained in substrates were dependent on the substrates. Fibroblast replication was determined by the incorporation of [H-3]-thymidine and compared to control groups. On collagen or chondroitin sulfate, the incorporation of GFs did not significantly improve cell proliferation. On hyaluronic acid, the incorporation of FGF and PDGF enhanced cell replication at 48 h. The incorporation of PDGF in fibronectin enhanced cell replication. On fibrin, the incorporation of PDGF, EGF, and FGF significantly enhanced cell replication. However, cell replication on FGF-incorporated fibrin was higher by 48 h than that on fibrin in the presence of FGF-supplemented culture medium. Fibrin sustains the biological activity of GFs, FGF in particular, and can be a carrier for GF that stimulates cell replication.","LAVAL UNIV, QUEBEC CITY G1L 3L5, PQ, CANADA; ST FRANCOIS DASSISES HOSP, QUEBEC CITY G1L 3L5, BC, CANADA",,,,,,,,31,38,41,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Cells were cultured on polylactide films and with media based on the artificially aged polylactides, as well as with different concentrations of the final degradation products (monomers). Implant site-related cell types were selected. Three kinds of epithelial cells (middle ear, ear canal and nasal septum) as well as fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells were used. Characteristic of all four polylactides was the normal morphology of cells when cultured on polylactide films and with the artificially ageing media. Although the polylactide films revealed still uncovered spots after 14 days culture, the control cultures were already confluent. The different concentrations of monomers revealed normal cell morphologies except for the 10 mg ml-1 concentration, which showed larger fibroblasts, and the nasal septum epithelium showed more signs of terminal differentiation for the 10 Mg ml-1 D-monomer than was seen for the L-Monomer even if the osmolarity was adjusted. The degradation products of polylactide are not expected to cause adverse reactions when implanted, since cell cultures with monomer concentrations up to 1 mg ml-1 resulted in normal morphologies.

When polystyrene was incubated with human serum, C3 was deposited on the surface by both adsorption and binding dependent on activation of the classical (CPW) and alternative (APW) pathways. After end-point attachment of heparin, significant C3 deposition, although at reduced levels, occurred only by CPW-mediated mechanisms, while adsorption and APW-mediated binding were strongly reduced. Generally, the modified surface bound lower amounts of protein, e.g. serum albumin and IgG, than the unmodified. By contrast, it had increased affinity for C1q which leads to binding of C1 and activation of complement via the CPW. Nevertheless, the net effect of the surface modification on the complement reaction was an overall reduction of C3 binding due to obliteration of APW. This can be related to an enhanced factor H/I-dependent down-regulation of C3b and to the lowered protein-adsorbing property of the surface, both of which have inhibitory effects on APW and on the C3 shunt-dependent activation of the complement system.","UNIV LINKOPING, INST APPL PHYS, LINKOPING, SWEDEN; CARMEDA MEDICARB, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN","NILSSON, UR (reprint author), UNIV HOSP UPPSALA, DEPT CLIN IMMUNOL & TRANSFUS MED, S-75185 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012; Nilsson Ekdahl, Kristina/B-5301-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730; ",,,,30,43,44,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0300-9475,1365-3083,,SCAND J IMMUNOL,Scand.

Tn mutants were isolated following growth at 42-degrees-C; mutants deficient in PS/A and slime production were selected. PS/A- and slime-deficient Tn mutants had a 10-fold decrease in vitro in the initial phase of adherence to catheters, comparable to levels of strains that do not produce PS/A. Introduction of Tn917-LTV1-interrupted DNA from PS/A-deficient mutant M187sn3 into the parental strain via transformation of protoplasts yielded recipients with inserts identical to those of the Tn mutant that were PS/A and slime deficient. Chromosomal DNA flanking the Tn in mutant M187sn3 was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA was found to hybridize to approximately 5-kb EcoRI fragments from the parental strain and from control Tn mutants that express parental levels of PS/A and to either approximately 9- or approximately 14-kb EcoRI fragments from other highly adherent, PS/A-producing strains. Mapping studies demonstrated that in the eight PS/A-deficient mutants that have been isolated, the Tn insertions all occur within a region of approximately 11.6 kb that is defined by three EcoRI sites. These results support previous findings indicating that in S. epidermidis PS/A is involved with in vitro adherence to plastic biomaterials and elaboration of PS/A is closely associated with slime production.","CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,DEPT MED,BOSTON,MA 02115; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115","MULLER, E (reprint author), BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT MED,CHANNING LAB,BOSTON,MA 02115, USA.",,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI 23335],,,36,95,94,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

A hypothesis that is based on surface hydrophilicity, surface flexibility, and adsorption media has been developed to understand the modulated adsorption of plasma proteins by PEUU additives. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and contact angle analysis were performed on two PEUU formulations as well as on PEUU formulations modified with Methacrol 2138F (co[diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate (DIPAM)/decyl methacrylate (DM)][3/1]) or acrylate or methacrylate polymer or copolymer analogs of Methacrol 2138F. Methacrol 2138F is a commercially used amphiphilic copolymethacrylate. ESCA showed that the PEUUs loaded with Methacrol 2138F or with its hydrophilic component, homopoly(DIPAM) (h-(DIPAM)), had a higher percentage of nitrogen at their surfaces than did the base PEUUs. Contact angle analysis also showed that the air side of PEUU formulations loaded with Methacrol 2138F were more hydrophobic than was the air side of base PEUUs when films were cast from dimethylacetamide. However, during contact angle testing, the air side of PEUU films loaded with Methacrol 2138F rapidly became more hydrophilic than did the air side of the base PEUU films. A radioimmunoassay and whole or diluted human plasma were also used to characterize the presence of the proteins fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G, factor VIII/von Willebrand factor, Hageman factor (factor XII), and albumin, on the surface of the same PEUUs as analyzed by ESCA and contact angle.

ESR studies in combination with chemical methods showed that 13-SO3Na-DDHA was an active photosensitizer. An ESR spectrum, assigned to the semiquinone radical anion of 13-SO3Na-DDHA was generated by illumination of a DMF buffer (1:1 by volume) solution of 13-SO3Na-DDHA in the presence of a series of reductive biomaterials. Using 13-SO3Na-DDHA as photosensitizer and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap, the ESR spectra of DMPO/SO3- radical adduct, ascorbyl radical and DMPO/O2.- radical adduct were obtained. Singlet oxygen formed from 13-SO3Na-DDHA photosensitization was detected by means of the 13-SO3Na-DDHA photosensitized oxidation of anthracene and ESR spectroscopy.

Polystyrene in the form of microtitre plates was used as target for C binding, detectable by ELISA using monoclonal anti-C3 antibodies specific for conformational epitopes expressed by bound C3 and C3 fragments. C3 binding in whole blood/plasma/serum is maximal at low dilutions and occurs predominantly by C activation. At higher dilutions, C3 binding occurs at approximately 1/3 of maximal levels and is solely an effect of adsorption. C3 adsorption in the lower serum dilution range, occurs at low but clearly detectable levels. Comparative epitope analysis between C3 fragments, actively bound to polystyrene in the presence of serum, and of iC3b bound to sheep erythrocytes, clearly indicates that C3 binding/activation on polystyrene takes place as a C3 convertase-mediated reaction, which in serum/plasma is followed by a secondary factor 1-dependent degradation of the bound C3b into iC3b. The neo-epitope analysis of serum-contacting polystyrene revealed that the adsorbed C3, throughout the entire serum dilution range tested, deposits in a state closely similar to that observed for purified C3 at a high packing density. Polystyrene surfaces with adsorbed purified C3 expressing this epitope profile were found to mediate APW dependent deposition of C3b in pig serum, presumably by forming a hybrid convertase with porcine Bb. These data therefore suggest that adsorbed C3 on serum-contacting polystyrene surfaces may initiate complement activation via the APW.","LINKOPING UNIV, APPL PHYS LAB, S-58183 LINKOPING, SWEDEN","NILSSON, UR (reprint author), UNIV HOSP UPPSALA, DEPT CLIN IMMUNOL & TRANSFUS MED, S-75185 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Nilsson, Bo/B-3102-2012","Nilsson, Bo/0000-0003-0057-2730",,,,34,31,31,0,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0161-5890,,,MOL IMMUNOL,Mol.

To support this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical properties of the ventral aorta wall of the lamprey, and showed that the architecture provides a mechanical structure that does produce functional mechanical properties similar to aortae in higher vertebrates.","UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISL,ATLANTIC VET COLL,DEPT ANAT & PHYSIOL,CHARLOTTETOWN C1A 4P3,PEI,CANADA","DEMONT, ME (reprint author), ST FRANCIS XAVIER UNIV,DEPT BIOL,ANTIGONISH B2G 1C0,NS,CANADA.",,,,,,,10,8,8,0,0,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"PO BOX 133 KLOSTERBERG 23, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0014-4754,,,EXPERIENTIA,Experientia,JAN 15,1993.0,49.0,1,,,,,43,46,,10.1007/BF01928787,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,KL308,WOS:A1993KL30800007,,,,,2019-02-25

In spite of these interests, however, only the CO2 + methanol and CO2 + ethanol systems have received much attention in the literature. Moreover, there appears to be some disagreement between the different sets of published data even for these systems. In order to compile a reliable set of data for modelling processes which involve CO2 + 1-alkanol mixtures, we have measured vapor - liquid equilibria in CO2 + ethanol, CO2 + 1-butanol, and CO2 + 1-pentanol mixtures at temperatures ranging from 314 to 337 K and pressures from 4.63 to 11.98 MPa. In this paper, we compare our data with data reported in the literature, and note trends as the 1-alkanol increases in size. The correlation of the data with a simple equation of state and an equation of state based on Statistical Associating Fluid Theory is also discussed.","GEORGIA INST TECHNOL,SCH CHEM ENGN,ATLANTA,GA 30332",,,,,,,,67,16,16,1,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0097-6156,,,ACS SYM SER,,,1993.0,514.0,,,,,,10,33,,,,,,24,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,KL230,WOS:A1993KL23000002,,,,,2019-02-25

The influence of biomaterials on organic matrix synthesis and the calcification process was analysed at the ultrastructural level (transmission electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis). Biomaterials were well tolerated by bone cells. Whichever biomaterial was used, osteoblasts proliferated and synthesized a new matrix constituted of fibrillar and non-fibrillar elements. This activity appeared earlier and was more intense with Biostite than with collagen sponge alone. A deposition of a mineral substance in this newly formed matrix was observed with the collagen sponge and Biostite, but never with hydroxyapatite alone. The mineral deposits were identified as hydroxyapatite crystals, similar to those observed and analysed in bone tissue. These in vitro observations clearly demonstrated the property of Biostite to produce a calcified collagenous matrix similar to bone tissue. However, in vivo confirmation is required before extending the use of this biomaterial to periodontology.","FAC ODONTOL LYON,LYON,FRANCE","SERRE, CM (reprint author), FAC A CARREL,INSERM,U234,LYON,FRANCE.",,"Chavassieux, Pascale/L-9071-2018",,,,,24,69,69,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1993.0,14.0,2,,,,,97,106,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90217-P,,,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,KK595,WOS:A1993KK59500003,8382091.0,,,,2019-02-25

Fluorescently labelled protein was used so changes in its distribution could be followed along with morphological states assessed with modulation-contrast microscopy. Our particular concern was with the quantitative relationship between the platelet and the fluorescent image. The findings from this study continue to support the idea that platelets do interact with adsorbed protein so that protein redistribution occurs and that thrombin accelerates this. Evidence is also presented to support platelet shrinkage, membrane vesicle formation and destruction as a result of thrombin. The shrinking of adherent platelets causes areas free of pre-adsorbed protein to be exposed. This process will be important determining the nature of the substrate available to cells contacting surfaces along with other adsorbed protein-related processes, e.g. reversible adsorption and post-adsorptive transitions.","MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT PATHOL,HAMILTON L8S 4L7,ONTARIO,CANADA","FEUERSTEIN, IA (reprint author), MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,HAMILTON L8S 4L7,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,30,15,15,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1993.0,14.0,2,,,,,137,147,,10.1016/0142-9612(93)90228-T,,,,11,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,KK595,WOS:A1993KK59500010,8435458.0,,,,2019-02-25

The use of several different endpoints might however generate more information concerning the nature of the toxicity. Thus, we examined the toxicity of two biomaterials, Polyvinylchloride (PVC) and Polyoximethene (POM), with different selected endpoints. The influence of cell growth on these endpoints was also investigated. Water extracts from the polymeric materials were tested on the continuous cell line L-929. Cell density, total protein, total protein per cell, fraction of cells in G0/G1- or S-phase, the concentration of ATP, ADP and AMP were used as endpoints. The PVC material did not significantly influence any of these endpoints until after 72 hours of exposure and the main part of the toxicity at 72 hours was related to higher proliferation rate in control cultures. After the cells had been incubated for 8 hour with POM the main toxic effect was on the energy parameters. In conclusion the PVC material was less toxic than the POM material. Our results also implies that the choice of endpoint will influence the evaluation of cytotoxicity.","UNIV LUND HOSP,DEPT ONCOL,S-22185 LUND,SWEDEN","WIESLANDER, AP (reprint author), GAMBRO AB,DEPT MED RES,LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,12,5,5,0,1,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",1055-7172,,,BIOMAT ARTIF CELL IM,Biomater.

The complexes (with active enzyme) and control grafts (no enzyme) were implanted over osseous defects in opposite halves of rat calvaria. After time intervals varying from 3-12 weeks, the calvaria were processed for light and electron microscopic examination and histomorphometric analysis. The ALP-containing sheets (but not their controls) rapidly accumulated mineral crystals. As the complexes mineralized, osteoblasts appeared and formed a layer of bone in direct contact with the grafted material. The results indicate that ALP induced the deposition of mineral crystals, and strongly suggest that it is this mineral component which influenced the formation of bone.","UNIV AMSTERDAM, FAC MED, DEPT CELL BIOL & HISTOL, AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","BEERTSEN, W (reprint author), ACAD CTR DENT AMSTERDAM, DEPT PERIODONTOL, EXPTL ORAL BIOL GRP, LOUWESWEG 1, 1066 EA AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.",,"Beertsen, Wouter/B-5308-2013","Beertsen, Wouter/0000-0001-5698-5986",,,,28,12,12,0,0,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0169-6009,,,BONE MINER,Bone Miner.,JAN,1993.0,20.0,1,,,,,41,55,,10.1016/S0169-6009(08)80036-0,,,,15,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,KP198,WOS:A1993KP19800004,8453321.0,,,,2019-02-25

The cells which grew on the materials produced all typical bone matrix proteins and were osteoblast-like as shown by immuno-staining. Analysis of the cell attachment kinetics revealed significant differences within the first 7 hours between the various materials. The best rate of cell attachment was found on the IC surface, followed by the TCP and then the PLA surface. The kinetics of attachment appeared to be due to different surface wettabilities and could be expressed by a linear equation. Further investigations showed an ion mediated attachment of osteoblasts on the surfaces. Quantitative analysis of non-collagenous protein matrix production and DNA content per cell was carried out, showing the best results for PLA, followed by IC and TCP, indicating that the material with the best primary attachment characteristics is not necessarily that on which the cells differentiate the best. Scanning electron microscopy observations of primary outgrowth cultures showed close contact of osteoblasts on all surfaces. It was concluded that such techniques may be developed as a means of batch testing bioactive biomaterials and investigating bone cell/biomaterial interactions.","WESTFAL WILHEMS UNIV,CELL BIOL LAB,DOMAGKSTR 3,D-48129 MUNSTER,GERMANY; GESELL GESUNDHEIT & UMWELTFORSCH MBH,FRANKFURT,GERMANY",,,,,,,,36,83,84,1,10,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1993.0,3.0,2,,,,,129,140,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,MA395,WOS:A1993MA39500002,,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro models of bone mineralization using collagenous substrates have been reported in the literature. This study reports an in vitro system of mineralized reconstituted collagen fibers, with aligned fibrillar substructure. The collagen fibers were mineralized in a double diffusion chamber saturated with respect to calcium and phosphate. The morphology and ultrastructure of the mineral precipitate were evaluated as a function of the pH of the incubating media. Brushite crystal was observed at acidic pH. Large rectangular crystals formed at pH 5.15 and appear to associate with the collagen fibers. At neutral and alkaline pHs, hydroxyapatite crystals were observed in association with the collagen fibers. Spherical aggregates of hydroxyapatite crystals were seen at neutral and alkaline pHs, but these structures were reduced in size when formed on collagen at alkaline pH. On close examination these spherical structures were found to be hollow when viewed in cross section. The crystals precipitated within the interior of the collagen fiber at neutral and alkaline pHs were comparable in both size and shape to crystals observed in mineralized turkey tendon and skeletal tissues. These preliminary observations indicate that with further refinement the reconstituted collagen fibers may prove useful in model systems for the study of collagen mediated mineralization in vitro. In addition, mineralization of collagenous matrices may lead to the development of biomaterials for bone repair and replacement.","UMDNJ, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT PATHOL, BIOMAT CTR,ROOM V-14, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08854 USA",,,,,,,,47,27,31,0,4,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666 USA",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1993.0,3.0,2,,,,,177,188,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,MA395,WOS:A1993MA39500007,,,,,2019-02-25

The sliding mass imparts a sudden impact load on the frozen surface of the material, creating a distortion free cleavage plane across the material. More traditional methods including bending and cutting with scissors introduce artifacts indirectly associated with stress concentration produced by bending, and sample compression at the edges with cutting.

Eye rubbing by the animals expulsed two of the lenticules and caused failure of two to epithelialize completely. The remaining three lenticules epithelialized, remained clear, and caused no adverse effects on the eye. Two of these lenticules developed focal areas of subepithelial thinning 3 months postoperatively and the third lenticule has remained stable for 30 months. The presence of epithelial attachment components at the epithelial-lenticule interface was demonstrated by immunolocalization. Histopathologic and ultrastructural examination revealed focal areas of epithelial invasion and degradation of the lenticule. Neutral proteases were detected in the thinning region of one specimen.

Despite these impediments, he carried on his classroom activities with typical energy. It was even earlier that at M.I.T., under the supervision of Ed Gilliland and myself, he carried out his doctoral research on the radiation grafting of styrene to polyethylene. Both he and I have dabbled in radiation chemistry on and off since then-he far more than I. Neither of us at that epoch had much idea about biomaterials or medical applications of materials-at least I did not-perhaps Allan had it in the back of his mind.

Significant variations in carbon-fluorine surface functionalities are obtained over a controllable range of film thickness. Film growth rate measurements reveal the occurrence of surface reactions during significant portions of the off portion of the duty cycle. Albumin adsorption on fluorocarbon-treated PET films is unchanged from PET controls for a 100-fold range of bulk concentrations and 60-fold range of adsorption times.

For such studies of surfaces for potential use in bone implants, cells derived from bone may be maintained in culture on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). We have determined the contribution that serum fibronectin (FN) or vitronectin (VN) make to the attachment and spreading of cells cultured from explanted human bone (bone-derived cells) during the first 90 min following seeding on culture surfaces. The attachment of bone-derived cells to TCPS was simulated two-fold by the addition of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the seeding culture medium. The roles of FN and VN were determined by selective removal of the FN or VN from the FBS prior to addition to the culture medium. FBS from which the VN had been removed did not have this stimulatory activity. In contrast, the attachment of bone-derived cells onto TCPS from medium containing FN-depleted serum (which contained VN) was the same as when intact FBS was used. There was incomplete attachment of bone-derived cells (27% of cells) when seeded in medium containing FBS depleted of both VN and FN. Our results show that for human bone-derived cells, the attachment onto TCPS of cells planted in medium containing FBS during the first 90 min of culture is principally as a result of adsorption onto the surface of serum VN. As unmodified polystyrene (PS) has also been used previously as a model biomaterial surface, PS was compared to TCPS for attachment of the bone-derived cells. Attachment of bone-derived cells to TCPS was twice that onto PS, both when the medium was serum-free and when it contained FBS. Bone-derived cells attached to TCPS or PS onto which purified VN or FN had been precoated, with VN adsorbed onto PS being as effective as was VN adsorbed onto TCPS. With FN, there was an effect of the polystyrene surface chemistry which was evident in that suboptimal concentrations of FN had a slightly higher potency when adsorbed onto TCPS than did the same concentrations of FN coated onto PS. When preadsorbed onto TCPS, the potency of FN for attachment of bone-derived cells was at least equal to that of VN.","UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PATHOL,KENSINGTON,NSW 2033,AUSTRALIA","STEELE, JG (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,SYDNEY LABS,POB 184,N RYDE,NSW 2113,AUSTRALIA.",,"Evans, Margaret/B-3261-2011","Evans, Margaret/0000-0003-3078-1576",,,,53,116,116,0,10,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

This article reviews methods of surface modification with water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), albumin, and heparin. PEO is a synthetic, neutral, water-soluble polymer, while albumin and heparin are a natural globular protein and an anionic polysaccharide, respectively. When grafted onto the surface, all three macromolecules share a common feature to reduce thrombogenicity of biomaterials. The reduced thrombogenicity is due to the unique hydrodynamic properties of the grafted macromolecules. In aqueous medium, surface-bound water-soluble polymers are expected to be highly flexible and extend into the bulk solution. Biomaterials grafted with either PEO, albumin, or heparin are able to resist plasma porotein adsorption and platelet adhesion predominantly by a steric repulsion mechanism.","PURDUE UNIV, SCH PHARM, W LAFAYETTE, IN 47907 USA",,,"Amiji, Mansoor/A-4365-2014","Amiji, Mansoor/0000-0001-6170-881X",NHLBI NIH HHS [HL 39081],,,110,248,256,1,74,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Adsorption rate constants and sticking coefficients (the fraction of encounters with the surface which result in adsorption) were calculated from the data. The adsorption rate constants are 4.8 x 10(-4), 1.3 x 10(-4), and 2.5 x 10(-5) cm/s on PDMS-PUU, PTMO-PUU and PEO-PUU respectively.

Conditioned media was evaluated for mitogenic activity using a rabbit aortic smooth muscle cell bioassay with or without preincubation with neutralizing anti-basic-FGF antibody. Results demonstrated increased mitogen release from macrophages harvested from the atherosclerotic rabbits. Only macrophages harvested from normal diet fed rabbits increased their mitogen release following exposure to either polyglactin 910 (p < 0.05) or to Dacron (p < 0.005) over controls. The stimulation of mitogen release by polyglactin 910 did not significantly exceed that in response to Dacron. In rabbits fed normal diets neutralization with the anti-basic-FGF antibody inhibited 100% of the Dacron induced mitogen release as compared to 36% of the polyglactin 910 induced mitogen release (p < 0.01).

Most studies involving shear, however, try to achieve a steady, pulse-free shear stress in studying cell-biomaterial interactions. In this study, human fibroblasts adhering to glass were exposed to an applied 0.5 Hz square-wave pulsatile shear, created in a parallel plate flow chamber by a computer-driven pump. Cells were also exposed to the single lower and higher shear stresses making up the square wave in the presence or absence of pressure variations due to the peristaltic roller pump. Results indicate that cells exposed to the applied square-wave regime showed a detachment rate in between that of the single shear stresses making up the square wave. Furthermore, the presence of the pulsations gave rise to elongated cell shapes in the direction of flow and the formation of a more extensive filopodial network than in the absence of pulsations. This was also true for cells exposed to the high shear component in the presence of pressure variations. Cells exposed to the high shear component without any pressure variations, however, adapted spherical shapes after the onset of flow.","UNIV GRONINGEN, MAT TECHN LAB, ANTONIUS DEUSINGLAAN 1, 9713 AV GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN, CTR BIOMED TECHNOL, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Kallikrein is easily detected by its reaction with the chromogenic substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA, which releases p-nitroaniline, revealed by its absorption at 405 nm. This test, which was already carried out by evaluating PKK activation by the 'end-point' method, has been carried out in this work by the more accurate 'initial velocity' method, i.e. by evaluating the activation from the initial rates of the KK-substrate reaction. The tests were carried out on the following materials: borosilicate glass (as a high-activation reference material), silicone (as a low-activation reference material), the commercial biomaterial Cardiothane 51, three graft copolymers synthesized in our laboratory by reacting ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL) with styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA), and EVAL itself. A mathematical treatment based on a simple kinetic model has been used for a first-approximation evaluation of the PKK-activating power of the materials tested. The quite low activating power of the EVAL-SMA copolymers, which are easily processable into water-permeable hollow fibers, suggests the possibility of their use in blood dialyzers.","UNIV PISA,DIPARTIMENTO INGN CHIM,I-56100 PISA,ITALY","GUERRA, GD (reprint author), CNR,CTR STUDI PROC ION POLIMERIZZAZ,VIA DIOTISALVI 2,I-56126 PISA,ITALY.",,,,,,,15,10,10,0,0,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Fibroblasts placed on a sponge of gelatin attached themselves to it, migrated well into the sponge, and remained inside it for at least 7 days. However, sponges of gelatin showed structural instability for hydrolytic degradation by the cells. Most fibroblasts appeared not to penetrate into the interior of a sponge of F-collagen but to remain on its surface when fibroblasts were placed on the sponge, suggesting poor attraction of F-collagen toward cells. Implantation experiments of sponges of F-collagen revealed an intense infiltration of neutrophils into the sponge, indicating F-collagen as an inducer of the inflammatory reaction. These aggravating characters of F-collagen sponges were greatly improved by blending gelatin with F-collagen.

With adherence to technical details (such as atraumatic screw insertion and the fixation of a well-contoured plate), rigid fixation techniques provide a reliable method for the treatment of mandibular fractures.

In contrast, only short-term, largely nonsystematic data are available on the performance of other, newer materials, such as soft silicones based on polydimethylsiloxane and copolymers of dimethyl- and diphenylsiloxane, hydrogels based on poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), and various ''temporary'' and ''permanent'' hydrophilic coatings. Some conflicting reports have been published on the long-term stability of isotactic polypropylene loop materials. However, the medical consensus seems to be that these are essentially stable to ultraviolet light energy reaching intraocular lenses during the expected service life in excess of 20 years. Uncertainty still surrounds the use of various ultraviolet-absorbing chromophores in the optics and/or haptics of intraocular lenses. Published reports indicate varying transmittance and effectiveness of ultraviolet-absorbing intraocular lenses. Furthermore, there is concern about the fate of the ultraviolet-absorbing chromophores during clinical conditions, especially with regard to degradation and leaching. Although a number of papers has been published on the effect of ultraviolet light energy on intraocular lenses, the experimental approaches differed substantively, so that intercomparative deductions must be made guardedly. A few papers have been published on the long-term biostability (hydrolytic, oxidative, and enzymatic) of intraocular lens materials. However, much of what has appeared in the literature is often illustrative of simplistic assumptions that largely ignore the environment of the eye. Clearly, the eventual success of newer materials must be based on performance characteristics that exceed those of the time-tested polymethylmethacrylate and the refined manufacturing technology designed to transform this polymer into intraocular lenses. The unquestioned clinical success of intraocular lenses rests on long historical data with PMMA that are unavailable with proposed newer materials. Thus, the entry of such new materials into the commercial market, meriting the acceptance of clinicians (and patients), must follow rather than precede thorough in vitro accelerated testing procedures under conditions that permit intercomparative conclusions and recommendations.",,"BRUCK, SD (reprint author), STEPHEN D BRUCK ASSOCIATES INC, BIOMAT & MED DEVICES CONSULTING GRP, POB 828, ROCKVILLE, MD 20848 USA.",,,,,,,52,5,5,0,9,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

In all cases the maximum strength was achieved fairly rapidly, usually at 1 week, after which there was little or no increase. Cements stored in water achieved the lowest compressive strengths, whereas cements stored in highly desiccating conditions, over concentrated sulphuric acid, achieved very high (if variable) compressive strengths. There appeared to be very little difference between the water-activated and conventional cements.

Normally, unstable heating can be overcome by heat conduction away from the overheated region, but in cases where the heating rate is very high, thermal relaxation has limited or no effect. We define three stability factors which indicate directly whether or not thermal runaway can occur, irrespective of the heating rate and the thermal properties of the heated material. These factors are dependent on the material's dielectric properties, as well as the geometry and the orientatation with respect to the E-field, of any irregularities. They can be used to provide clear guidelines to choices of source frequency and applicator geometry, which are favorable for the intrinsic control of thermal runaway. Experimental results are presented for a spherical workpiece (representing a cryopreserved rabbit kidney) warmed from -90-degrees-C to above 0-degrees-C in 30 to 60 seconds, in a 434 MHz resonant cavity applicator.

To gain insight into the mechanism of stenting in humans and its short- and long-term implications, we studied the vascular wall of saphenous vein aortocoronary bypass grafts after implantation of the Wallstent. Background. The implantation of a stent in aortocoronary bypass grafts may provide an alternative solution for revascularization in patients who are poor candidates for reoperation. Because human histopathologic findings after stenting with the Wallstent have not previously been described in detail, we examined graft segments that were surgically retrieved from 10 patients (21 stents) at 3 days to 10 months after implantation of the stent. Methods. The grafts were examined by a combination of the following techniques: light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results. Early observations revealed that large amounts of platelets and leukocytes adhered to the stent wires during the first few days. At 3 months, the wires were embedded in a layered new intimal thickening, consisting of smooth muscle cells in a collagenous matrix. In addition, foam cells were abundant near the wires. Extracellular lipids and cholesterol crystals were found after 6 months. Smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix formed the predominant component of restenosis. This new intimal thickening was lined with endothelium, in some cases showing defect intercellular junctions and abnormal adherence of leukocytes and platelets as late as 10 months after implantation. Conclusions. This type of stent is potentially thrombogenic and seems to be associated with extracellular lipid accumulation in venous aortocoronary bypass grafts.","ERASMUS UNIV,THORAXCTR,DEPT CARDIOL,EE 2332,POB 1738,3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; ERASMUS UNIV,THORAXCTR,DEPT THORAC SURG,3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; ERASMUS UNIV,DEPT PATHOL,3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS; ACAD HOSP ROTTERDAM DIJKZIGT,ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,37,121,123,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0735-1097,,,J AM COLL CARDIOL,J.

J,"LOPEZ, GD",,,,"LOPEZ, GD",,,BIODETERIORATION AND CORROSION OF METALLIC IMPLANTS AND PROSTHETIC DEVICES,MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRES,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,,,"The use of surgical implants and prosthetic devices to replace the original function of different components of the human biological system is a well established tradition in the history of medicine. Currently, one of the most prevalent points of view in dealing with this subject, is that of biocompatibility of materials of construction and methods of fabrication of these devices, in order to avoid negative impacts on the patient due to failure of implants through degradation mechanisms such as corrosion. This article presents a current general review of the relationship between biocompatibility and deterioration of metallic implants and prosthetic devices, emphasizing the specific forms that corrosion adopts in biological media. The historical perspective shows the consolidation of a tendency towards a more systematic study of these phenomena in recent years, as opposed to trial and error practices that used to be common before the third decade of this century. The understanding of interactions between implants and biological tissue, thus led to some of the most promising current techniques, such as the use of powder metallurgy components to optimize skeletal fixation of implants by means of intersticial bone growth into porous metallic surfaces. The review of metals and alloys currently used for the fabrication of implants shows the amplitude of available technological alternatives, as well as the multiple criteria required to make a good selection for each specific case. Applications and pros and cons of stainless steels, Cr, Ni, Co and Ti alloys, and tantalum are briefly discussed. The introduction to basic concepts of corrosion, serves as a basis for the description of the typical forms that these phenomena adopt in biological media, including pitting, crevice corrosion, fatigue-corrosion, stress corrosion, fretting corrosion, galvanic corrosion, and intergranular corrosion. This review shows that the study of interactions between biological media and metallic implants has become a well established and specific field of science. As a result of this conclusion, an interdisciplinary treatment of the subject of biodeterioration of metallic implants and prosthetic devices is proposed. In practical terms, this proposal can be understood as the integration of an expert in materials science and engineering to the medical team. Thus, quality and reliability of the implant, as well as maximization of its useful life, would be achieved through the implementation of technical specifications, accepted standards, and pertinent testing as recommended by the above mentioned expert, who will be the person of the team more able to grasp the novelties that the dynamic field of biomaterials constantly offers.",,"LOPEZ, GD (reprint author), INGAR,INST DESARROLLO & DISENO,AVELLANEDA 3657,RA-3000 SANTA FE,ARGENTINA.",,,,,,,28,9,12,2,16,MEDICINA (BUENOS AIRES),BUENOS AIRES,"DONATO ALVAREZ 3150, 1427 BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA",0025-7680,,,MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRE,Med.-Buenos Aires,,1993.0,53.0,3,,,,,260,274,,,,,,15,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,LP721,WOS:A1993LP72100012,8114635.0,,,,2019-02-25

The supplement supplied the first population-based estimates of prevalence and morbidity of selected medical devices. Projected to the United States population, the survey results indicate that an estimated 674,000 adults were using 811,000 hip implants. Hip implant recipients were significantly more likely to be older, to be white, and to have lower educational income, and activity levels than the general population of adults. After age-stratification, however, only differences in activity limitation and race remained. Current economic outlays for hip replacement surgery are substantial. With the aging population, use of health services by patients with artificial hips will probably increase unless measures to reduce the need for replacement surgery are instituted. These measures include reducing injuries and improving biomaterials.

While these systems are well known for separating biomaterials, only a handful of papers have appeared investigating their utility for separating metal ions. The few results that have appeared in the literature have utilized salt solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and fall into two categories: 1) partitioning of the metal ion to the PEG-rich phase by the addition of a water-soluble extractant which coordinates the metal ion and 2) addition of an inorganic anion which produces a metal complex that partitions to the PEG-rich phase. In addition the authors have recently added a third category: 3) partitioning of a metal ion directly from the salt-rich to the PEG-rich phase without an added component. It appears that a separations strategy can be developed for metal ions from all areas of the periodic table under a wide variety of conditions.

A mobile laboratory research team evaluated cheetahs using anesthesia, serial blood sampling, electroejaculation (males), and laparoscopy (females). Biomaterials were also collected for parallel studies of genetics, nutrition, and health. There was no mortality, and cheetahs were capable of reproducing naturally after these intense manipulatory examinations. No marked differences were observed in reproductive or endocrine characteristics between proven and unproven breeders. However, males consistently produced teratospermic ejaculates, and cheetah sperm were compromised in conspecific or heterologous in vitro fertilization systems. Structurally abnormal sperm were found to be filtered by the oocyte's zona pellucida. More than 80% of the females were anatomically sound, but morphological and endocrine evidence suggested that approximately 50% or more of the population may have had inactive ovaries at the time of the examination. Males ranging in age from 15 to 182 months produced spermic ejaculates, but motile sperm numbers/ejaculate and circulating testosterone concentrations were highest in males 60 to 120 months old. Parovarian cysts were observed in 51.5% of female cheetahs, but comparisons between proven and unproven subpopulations revealed that this abnormality likely had no influence on fertility. Fresh luteal tissue was not observed in any nonpregnant or nonlactating female, strongly suggesting that the cheetah is an induced ovulator. Overall survey results were discussed in the context of the etiology of reproductive inefficiency, especially with respect to the potential importance of biological versus management factors. Four high priority research areas in cheetah reproductive biology were identified: 1) continuous monitoring of ejaculate quality in the extant population, while studying the impact of pleiomorphisms on fertility; 2) determining the potential relationship between libido and androgen production (excretion) in males; 3) confirming the extent of cyclic, or acyclic, ovarian activity in females; and 4) continued development of assisted reproductive techniques for enhancing management. In summary, a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional survey coordinated through the SSP is both possible and useful for generating a physiological and health database beneficial to driving further research and management initiatives.",,"WILDT, DE (reprint author), SMITHSONIAN INST,NOAHS CTR,DEPT ANIM HLTH,NATL ZOOL PK,WASHINGTON,DC 20008, USA.",,,,,,,0,65,68,2,29,WILEY-LISS,NEW YORK,"DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0733-3188,,,ZOO BIOL,Zoo Biol.,,1993.0,12.0,1,,,,,45,80,,10.1002/zoo.1430120107,,,,36,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,KR769,WOS:A1993KR76900006,,,,,2019-02-25

This ECM, obtained by removing BCEC with an hypotonic shock can be used as a substratum for other endothelial cell growth. Human endothelial cells (HEC) were purified from omentum that was digested with a solution of collagenase-dispase, then filtered through nylon meshes. The cells were further purified by centrifugation onto a Percoll gradient. A comparative study on the attachment and growth of HEC on various coatings (laminin, poly-L-lysine, fibronectin or ECM) indicates that ECM is the most performing substratum. The quality of this endothelium was confirmed by the presence of factor VIII, and MHC class I and the absence of class II antigens.","CHU HENRI MONDOR,CTR RECH CHIRURG,CNRS,URA 1431,F-94010 CRETEIL,FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 12,RECH CROISSANCE CELLULAIRE REPARAT & REGENERAT TISSULAIRES LAB,F-94000 CRETEIL,FRANCE",,,,,,,,13,10,10,0,0,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Adsorption of fibrinogen from blood plasma to many materials exhibits a maximum with respect to plasma dilution and exposure time (the Vroman effect). In this study fibrinogen adsorption to several polymers was examined to ascertain the influence of controlled changes in surface chemistry on the Vroman effect. The materials included hydroxyethylmethacrylate-ethylmethacrylate (HEMA/EMA) copolymers, Biomer, and a series of segmented polyurethanes (PEUs), two of which contained fluorinated chain extenders. Each material exhibited maximal adsorption of fibrinogen at intermediate plasma concentrations. Little effect of soft-segment type or molecular weight was observed and no significant differences in fibrinogen adsorption to the fluorinated PEUs were seen. Changes in the strength of fibrinogen attachment to these materials with time after adsorption were also assessed. Fibrinogen adsorbed for 1 min was displaced more readily by blood plasma than that adsorbed for 1 h, regardless of the material. The more hydrophobic polymers exhibited greater retention of adsorbed fibrinogen. In addition, the fraction of fibrinogen retained by polyethylene depended on the amount of fibrinogen adsorbed to the surface, being greatest when the surface loading was the least. These studies indicate that spreading or transition of adsorbed fibrinogen molecules from a weakly to tightly bound state is a general consequence of protein adsorption to solid surfaces.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT CHEM ENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195","SLACK, SM (reprint author), MEMPHIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,MEMPHIS,TN 38152, USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL25951, HL19419]; NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296]",,,45,39,39,1,4,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Confocal microscopy enables high-resolution imaging to be achieved below semitransparent surfaces in intact living specimens, but this may still be impractical for intraoral applications because of the need to stabilize the sample. The development of a steadying objective (X 240 overall mag.) which is held against the sample surface and is focused by moving internal elements, avoids the need for fine adjustment of the living sample under the microscope to achieve a change of focus. It is therefore more comfortable and also reduces the problems of movement due to the pulse. The objective was used with a tandem scanning microscope, with images recorded via a SIT video camera. Using this system internal tooth structure (e.g. enamel prisms/adhesive restoration interfaces) and the lining cells of the gingival crevice through to the junctional epithelium may be examined. It is also possible to image the oral mucous membrane, focusing to the capillary loops in the basal layers, where streaming red blood cells can be seen. Access is limited to the anterior regions as far back as the premolar teeth. Applications could include caries research, soft and hard tissue responses to biomaterials (e.g. implants), wound healing and monitoring the effect of periodontal treatment regimens. This new technique offers numerous exciting opportunities for the microscopic investigation of many clinical operative procedures in vivo, allowing the response of the tissues to be non-destructively monitored, over time, at high resolution.","UNITED MED & DENT SCH GUYS & ST THOMAS HOSP,GUYS HOSP,DEPT CONSERVAT DENT,LONDON,ENGLAND",,,"Watson, Timothy/C-6815-2013","Watson, Timothy/0000-0001-6039-3780",,,,14,23,23,1,2,BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0300-5712,,,J DENT,J.

Both networks show large contact-angle hysteresis due to surface heterogenity and surface rearrangements. The balance of the polar/nonpolar forces of the dry networks, as quantitated by the I(p)/W(A)d ratio is much below unity; upon equilibrating in water the I(p)/W(A)d ratio increases but remains below unity. Protein adsorption from human plasma and human monocyte adhesion to A and amphiphilic networks possessing polar/nonpolar ratios lower than unity have been investigated. Both networks adsorb less fibrinogen, albumin and Hageman factor (factor XII) than glass, polyethylene (PE), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The extent of adsorption of factor VIII on A, H and glass are very similar. Adsorption of IgG on A was appreciable, however, on H it was less than on any of the other surfaces studied. Monocyte adhesion was significantly inhibited on both networks and glass, relative to a positive adhesive surface such as tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS Evidently both the A and the H networks exhibit reduced protein adsorption and cell adhesion which indicates biocompatibility of these networks at blood contacting surfaces. The ratio of the polar/nonpolar forces expresed by the I(p)/W(A)d ratio may be useful to predict low protein adsorption and cell adhesion on polymer surfaces.","UNIV AKRON,INST POLYMER SCI,AKRON,OH 44325; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL & MACROMOLEC,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; RES INST PLAST IND,H-1950 BUDAPEST,HUNGARY",,,,,,,,27,44,45,2,16,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0170-0839,,,POLYM BULL,Polym.

The complement system is activated by exposure of different biomaterials to blood. Recently a watertight knitted Dacron aortic prosthesis impregnated with bovine collagen has been developed. One potential disadvantage is that this bovine collagen may activate the complement system and evoke the production of inflammatory mediators. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortic surgery with implantation of Dacron prosthesis on the complement system in the perioperative period and at 3 months after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 2 1). Twelve patients who had cholecystectomy served as controls. CH50 consumption and C3a generation were determined to study overall complement activation. Furthermore, C3a/C3 fractions were calculated. Finally, C4 and factor B consumption were determined to evaluate the complement stimulation via the classic and the alternative pathways, respectively. We found significant activation of the complement system during the operation in both the collagen group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p = 0.03; C4 consumption: 74%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 73%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction increase: 173%, p = 0.04), and the nonimpregnated group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p < 0.0001; C4 consumption: 71%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 76%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction increase: 165%,p = 0.025), with no statistically significant differences between the groups of prostheses. Activation was initiated via both the classic and the alternative pathway. This indicates aortic implantation significantly activates the complement system, but that collagen-impregnated prostheses do not stimulate the complement system any more than its nonsealed substrate. Comparing results in patients with vascular disease with controls, a significantly increased complement activation was observed in the vascular group (CH50 consumption: 40%,p < 0.0001; C4 consumption: 74%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 75%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction: 169%, p = 0.002), compared with the controls (CH50 consumption: 71%; CA consumption: 104%; factor B consumption: 94%; C3a/C3 fraction: 119%, all p = NS), with statistical significant differences between the vascular group and cholecystectomies (CH50: p = 0.005; C4: p = 0.002; factor B: p < 0.0001, and C3a/C3 fraction: NS). This observation demonstrates that aortic surgery with the implantation of a Dacron prosthesis significantly activates the complement system.","UNIV HOSP LEIDEN, DEPT NEPHROL, 2300 RC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS; UNIV HOSP LEIDEN, GAUBIUS LAB, 2300 RC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","VANOTTERLOO, JCAD (reprint author), UNIV HOSP LEIDEN, DEPT SURG, POB 9600, 2300 RC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,31,20,20,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

We found that the ability of S. epidermidis to hemagglutinate erythrocytes correlated with the adherence of bacteria to plastic and to intravenous catheters. S. epidermidis isolates responsible for prosthetic-valve endocarditis (n = 61) and isolates from intravenous catheters (n = 59) were significantly more likely to cause hemagglutination than isolates from the skin of preoperative cardiac surgery patients (n = 19) (P = 0.027). S. epidermidis isolates (n = 23) recovered from the skin of patients 7 to 10 days after cardiac surgery were significantly more likely to exhibit hemagglutination than the preoperative isolates (P = 0.015). By a quantitative adherence assay, we also observed that the hemagglutination titer and number of species of erythrocytes agglutinated correlated directly with adherence to polystyrene (P < 0.001). In addition, hemagglutinating isolates were significantly more likely to be recovered in high number from intravenous catheters when semiquantitative catheter culture techniques were used (P < 0.001). We speculate that hemagglutinin(s) either plays a direct role in adherence to polymers and thus prosthetic-device infection or serves as an easily demonstrable marker for adherence-prone isolates.","VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIV,MED COLL VIRGINIA,DEPT INTERNAL MED,DIV INFECT DIS,RICHMOND,VA 23298",,,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [AI 21772, F32 AI 08416]",,,38,51,51,0,2,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

In spite of some disparities, the TiN behavior towards albumin and fibrinogen is interesting, compared with the one of a reference medical grade elastomer.

The interface between this mineralized ECM and the HA was studied at the ultrastructural level with scanning and transmission electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis. Initially, the deposition of a globular, afibrillar matrix was observed on HA. This was followed by the integration of collagen fibers in this matrix and their subsequent mineralization. At the bone-HA interface two distinctly different interfacial structures were observed. An electron-dense layer with a thickness of 20-60 nm was regularly present, which contained both organic and inorganic material and was rich in glycosaminoglycans. The interfaces differed however, in the presence or absence of an amorphous zone which was free of collagen fibers and had an average thickness of 0.7-0.8-mu-m. It was frequently seen interposed between the electron-dense layer and the hydroxyapatite.

This report presents evidence that human PMNs display morphological changes related to foreign material challenge, including activation on F-75 bead surfaces, pinocytosis of corrosion products, formation of intracellular vacuoles, degranulation, etc. Moreover, when PMNs were present, the corrosion release rate of F-75 increased as much as three times over cell-free controls.","CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOENGN,301 RHODES ENGN RES CTR,CLEMSON,SC 29634; CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,CLEMSON,SC 29634",,,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR39334],,,30,7,8,0,1,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The resulting copolymers have physical properties similar to those of PEG while the carboxylic acid groups Of L-lysine provide multiple pendent groups along the polymer backbone for further functionalization. By using PEG chains of different molecular weights, a homologous series of PEG-Lys copolymers was prepared containing one lysine unit every 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Da. The pendent carboxylic acid groups were utilized in cross-linking reactions leading to amide cross-links, new acyl semicarbazide cross-links, and hydroxyethyl acrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate derived cross-links. The resulting hydrogels formed transparent, highly swollen films. At an equilibrium water content of about 80%, these films exhibited a relatively high degree of tensile strength ranging from 0.26 to 1.09 MPa. Due to their favorable physicomechanical properties and the nontoxicity of the components, PEG-Lys-derived hydrogels may find applications as biomaterials.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855",,,,,,,,27,56,56,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,AUG 31,1992.0,25.0,18,,,,,4476,4484,,10.1021/ma00044a004,,,,9,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JL964,WOS:A1992JL96400004,,,,,2019-02-25

Lower levels of maximal platelet deposition were obtained for VN-coated silicone rubber (SR) than for other VN-coated substrates with comparable levels of adsorbed VN, but this effect was diminished with increased residence time of VN on the SR surface. Submonolayer and monolayer surface concentrations of VN elicited similar maximal levels of platelet deposition at both short (<3 h) and long (>12 h) residence times, but thrombi were larger and more dense for the submonolayer surface concentrations. VN was also more effective in forming thrombi when adsorbed sequentially before albumin instead of after albumin. To further examine these differences in the nature of adsorbed VN between substrates and adsorption conditions, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) elutability measurements and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance optics (FTIR-ATR) evaluations of the adsorbed protein were performed. An SDS solution was able to remove a greater percentage of the VN which was adsorbed to a submonolayer than a monolayer surface concentration when SDS displacement was initiated immediately after adsorption was terminated. However, if the adsorbed protein was allowed to reside on the surface for a length of time before the introduction of the SDS displacing media, a greater percentage of the monolayer surface concentration was removed. The submonolayer surface concentration may be better able to increase its strength of contact with the surface during the added residence time than the monolayer surface concentration. FTIR-ATR spectra of VN showed less structural alterations when it was adsorbing to SR than to a segmented polyurethane, a more thrombogenic material when coated with VN. Thus, the ability of VN to stimulate thrombus formation appeared to correlate with the percentage of VN which was nonelutable by SDS and the amount of structural alterations observed by FTIR-ATR, both of which are indications of its extent of contact with the surface.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT CHEM ENGN, 1415 W JOHNSON DR, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT MED, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-24046, HL-21001]",,,42,12,12,0,4,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-6245,2567-689X,,THROMB HAEMOSTASIS,Thromb.

Human peripheral blood neutrophils were incubated with several sterile, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free biomaterials used in surgically implantable prosthetic devices: polyurethane, woven dacron, and velcro. Free radical formation as the superoxide (O2-) anion was evaluated by cytochrome c reduction in neutrophils that were exposed to the materials and then removed and in neutrophils allowed to remain in association with the materials. Neutrophils exposed to polyurethane or woven dacron for 30 or 60 min and then removed consistently exhibited an enhanced release of O2- after simulation via receptor engagement with formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Enhanced reactivity to stimulation via protein kinase C with phorbol myristate acetate, however, was not consistently observed. The cells evaluated for O2- release during continous association with the biomaterials showed enhanced metabolic activity during short periods of association (especially with polyurethane and woven dacron). Although O2- release by neutrophils in association with these materials decreased with longer periods of incubation, it was not obliterated. These studies, therefore, show that several commonly used biomaterials activate neutrophils soon after exposure and that this activated state diminishes with prolonged exposure but nevertheless remains measurable. The diminishing level of activity with prolonged exposure, however, suggests that ultimately a depletion of reactivity may occur and may result in increased susceptibility to periprosthetic infection.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT MOLEC GENET & BIOCHEM,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213; UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213","KAPLAN, SS (reprint author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213, USA.",,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM41734-01],,,28,49,49,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

However, collagen-based biomaterials may induce cytotoxic effects. This study evaluated possible cytotoxic effects of (crosslinked) dermal sheep collagen (DSC) using a 7-d-methylcellulose cell culture with human skin fibroblasts. Noncrosslinked DSC (NDSC), hexamethylene-diisocyanate-crosslinked DSC (HDSC), and glutaraldehyde-crosslinked DSC (GDSC), their extracts (1 x 10 d to 4 x 10 d extracts), or the corresponding extracted DSC samples were tested. Cell growth was evaluated by cell counting, while cell morphology was assessed by light microscopy and transmission-electron microscopy. Both GDSC and, to a lesser extent, HDSC, induced cytotoxicity, observed as inhibited cell growth and deviant cell morphology. The deviant morphology consisted of extensive accumulations of lipid, reduction in the amount and dilatation of rough endoplasmatic reticulum, increased inclusions of cell remnants, and relatively rounded cell membranes. With HDSC, both primary cytotoxicity, due to extractable products from the material, and secondary cytotoxicity, possibly due to a release of cytotoxic products resulting from enzymatic cell-biomaterial interactions, could be discriminated. With GDSC, however, no clear distinction between primary and secondary cytotoxicity could be made. With NDSC, only primary cytotoxicity, measured as low inhibition of cell proliferation, but without deviant morphology, was observed. These remarkable differences in cytotoxicity are discussed in relation to residual agents and specific crosslinks present in DSCs as a consequence of processing and the crosslinking agents used. The residual agents and the specific crosslinks give rise to differences in direct release of products and in sensitivity to hydrolysis and enzymatic breakdown.","TWENTE UNIV,DEPT CHEM TECHNOL,7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,BIOMAT RES SECT,OOSTERSINGEL 69-2,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,38,113,113,1,13,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

A control collagen-glycosaminoglycan sponge was rapidly invaded by mononuclear cells (8 days), with the formation of granulation tissue. Calcification was observed at the periphery of the implant after 8 days, and the implant was entirely calcified after 15 days; it was degraded progressively after 30 days. Acyl azide treatment increased the persistence of the sponge in vivo up to 90 days and inhibited its calcification. A glutaraldehyde-treated sponge was completely calcified after 15 days, and calcified nodules persisted after 90 days. Thus, acyl azide method efficiently cross-linked a collagen-glycosaminoglycan sponge and inhibited calcification after subcutaneous implantation in rats (at least up to 90 days after implantation).",,"ANSELME, K (reprint author), UNIV LYON 1,INST BIOL & CHIM PROT,CNRS,URA 412,CYTOL MOLEC LAB,F-69622 VILLEURBANNE,FRANCE.",,"Petite, Herve/E-3478-2016","Petite, Herve/0000-0003-1694-5060; Anselme, Karine/0000-0002-6669-205X",,,,39,26,26,0,3,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0934-8832,,,MATRIX,Matrix,AUG,1992.0,12.0,4,,,,,264,273,,10.1016/S0934-8832(11)80078-8,,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,JK670,WOS:A1992JK67000003,1435510.0,,,,2019-02-25

A transition was measured from the dilute to the entangled polymer solution regimes with increasing PEO molecular weight (at constant PEO weight fraction) or with increasing PEO weight fraction (at constant PEO molecular weight). In solutions containing approximately 10 % w/w PEO, the transition was detected in the vicinity of PEO 10 000 Da, which supports our recently advanced hypothesis that changes in PEO molecular weight influence protein partitioning in the two-phase aqueous PEO-dextran system through an accompanying transition in the structure of the PEO-rich solution phase. To elucidate the roles of repulsive steric and attractive forces on the interactions of hydrophilic proteins and PEO, SANS measurements of (1) aqueous solutions of PEO 8650 Da containing identifiable PEO coils, (2) aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and (3) aqueous solutions containing a mixture of BSA and PEO 8650 Da were performed. Although the net interaction between the 8650 Da PEO and BSA was found to be strongly repulsive, the second virial coefficient reflecting protein-polymer interactions was found to be only 80 % of the value predicted for purely excluded-volume interactions, thus suggesting the existence of an attractive interaction between a PEO coil and BSA. A quantitative model of the solution structure indicates that an attractive interaction energy of about 0.05kT (per polymer segment interacting with the protein) is sufficient to describe the influence of BSA-PEO interactions on the SANS intensity measurements. This is consistent with recently developed statistical-thermodynamic models of protein-polymer interactions in the two-phase aqueous PEO-dextran system.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,,,,,,55,72,72,1,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 20,1992.0,25.0,15,,,,,3932,3941,,10.1021/ma00041a016,,,,10,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JE746,WOS:A1992JE74600016,,,,,2019-02-25

Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that platelets were not involved in clot formation near the blood/biomaterial interface. Thus, it was concluded that the system of contact activation of the coagulation cascade dominates during clot formation under static conditions.

While the sensitivity to corrosion and the effectiveness of galvanic elements is measurable by electrochemical methods, suitable methods of determining the fieldstrength in the vicinity of biomaterial surfaces are still unavailable.

C-14-marked Bovine Serum Albumin serves as a modelprotein. Determination of the total number of protein molecules adsorbed is effected via the detection of the emitted electrons. The quotient of the concentration of natural proteins to the concentration of adsorbed molecules gives the biocompatibility index, which is independant of the surface area, and gives an indication of the expected biocompatibility of the material. The results of the biological tests of titanium and two coating materials on titanium were confirmed in an animal experiment.

Two important mediators of the inflammatory response are Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), both of which exert a wide range of biologic effects on many cells. This study was designed to evaluate the release of these cytokines by human monocytes (HM) brought into contact with four biomaterials utilized in clinical practice: polyurethane, expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE), Dacron velour, and woven Dacron. In vitro cultures for the generation of IL-1 and TNF by HM in the presence of the above biomaterials were established by exposing cells to each biomaterial in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with harvest of supernatants after 6 or 18 h. These studies showed that in the absence of LPS, IL-1 was released only by Dacron velour and woven Dacron associated monocytes while TNF was secreted in response to all of the materials. When LPS was present, however, monocytes associated with all of the materials released IL-1; and TNF release was greatly augmented. Further, the quantity of released cytokine was directly related to the duration of the association time. This study demonstrated that HM in association with various biomaterials were activated to produce both TNF and IL-1 and that the addition of nanogram quantities of LPS, such as would be produced if infection were present, greatly increased the amount of cytokines released.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT SURG,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261",,,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01-GM-41734],,,34,75,75,0,7,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

In this study the contribution that adsorption of serum fibronectin (Fn) or vitronectin (Vn) make to the attachment and spreading of fibroblast cells during the first 90 min following seeding was determined for two modified tissue culture polystyrenes, as model biomaterial surfaces. The amount of serum Vn and Fn which adsorbed onto tissue culture grade polystyrene (TCP) from different serum concentrations over the range of 0.1-30% (v/v) were determined and compared to attachment of cells of the BHK-21 and HT1080 fibroblast lines. There was no simple correlation between the amount of Fn or the amount of Vn adsorbed and cell attachment and spreading. The requirement for Fn or Vn for attachment and spreading of BHK-21 or HT1080 cells onto modified polystyrene (either TCP or to Primaria) during the first 90 min of cell culture was directly tested by selective removal of Fn or Vn from the serum prior to addition to the culture medium. Attachment and spreading of BHK-21 or HT1080 cells onto TCP or Primaria surfaces were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when the cells were seeded in medium containing 2% (v/v) or higher concentrations of Vn-depleted serum. BHK-21 cells or HT1080 cells seeded in medium containing Fn-depleted serum (which contained Vn) attached and spread onto TCP or Primaria. Both BHK-21 cells and HT1080 cells failed to attach to TCP or Primaria when seeded in medium containing serum depleted of both Vn and Fn. The requirement for serum Vn or Fn for fibroblast attachment to TCP was also tested using cells of a human dermal fibroblast strain. The attachment of the dermal fibroblasts to TCP during the first 90 min of culture was not decreased by depletion of Vn from the 15% (v/v) serum, but there was a reduction in the proportion of the attached cells which had spread. Selective depletion of serum Fn did not have any effect on either cell attachment or spreading. Our results show that for fibroblast cells, particularly with cell lines such as BHK-21 or HT1080 but also with cell strains, the first binding of cells onto tissue culture polystyrene when plated in medium containing serum is a result of adsorption onto the surface of serum Vn. The adsorption of serum Vn onto the surface overcomes the effect of serum components which tend to decrease cell attachment.",,"STEELE, JG (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV BIOMOLEC ENGN,MOLEC BIOL LAB,POB 184,N RYDE,NSW 2113,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,32,138,138,1,18,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The polymer interface materials covered a wide range of elemental composition and surface properties, and were prepared from N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, gamma-butyrolactone, n-hexane, and hexamethyldisilazane (PPHMDSZ). The biocompatibility studies showed that the interface materials were noncytotoxic to mouse and human fibroblasts, as shown by morphologic evaluation, and by determination of extracellular LDH; and they did not stimulate interleukin-1-like production from human monocytes, as indicated by a thymocyte proliferation assay. The human fibroblast proliferation assay showed that three of the polymers supported cell growth at levels comparable to, or greater than, polymer controls, while the hydrophobic PPHMDSZ inhibited both cell attachment and proliferation. The response to subcutaneous implantation for all test materials was indicative of biocompatibility, with rapid resolution of the acute phase response and normal wound healing.

To study the role of porosity/fluid absorption capacity, various biomaterials such as polyurethane, hydrophilic polyurethane foam, Type I collagen sponges, and bioprosthetic heart valve tissue were examined in in vitro and in vivo models. In view of the exceedingly low levels of polyurethane calcification, it seems that the rat subcutaneous model is not suitable for routine studies of the mechanism of polyurethane calcification. The calcification extent of both collageneous and hydrophilic polyurethane, was found to be in good correlation with the water absorption capacity of these biomaterials.

In this study, pure Ti, Ti6Al4V alloy, austenitic and martensitic Ni-Ti alloys, pure Ni, AISI Type 316L stainless steel, Co-Cr alloy, and alpha-alumina were investigated. All metallic materials were mechanically polished and oxidized at 300-degrees-C for 30 min in pure oxygen. Oxide films formed on the surfaces of these materials were examined under the electron microscope and their crystalline structures were identified by the electron diffraction method. The initial contact angle (theta-0) and its changes (delta-theta/delta-t) as a function of time in 1% NaCl solution drop were measured. The results of this study indicated that (i) Ti and its alloys were covered with mainly TiO2 (tetragonal structure), (ii) NiO (cubic structure) was found on pure Ni, (iii) the spinel type oxide (cubic structure) was formed on both 316L stainless steel and Co-Cr alloy, (iv) TiO2 (except for oxides formed on Ti6Al4V alloy) showed a rapid spreading characteristic in 1% NaCl solution; while (v) a relatively slow spreading behaviour was observed on the cubic structure oxides.","BAYLOR COLL DENT,DEPT ORTHODONT,DALLAS,TX 75246; UNIV TSUKUBA,INST MAT SCI,TSUKUBA,IBARAKI 305,JAPAN","OSHIDA, Y (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,SCH DENT,DEPT DENT MAT,1121 W MICHIGAN ST,INDIANAPOLIS,IN 46202, USA.",,"Miyazaki, Shuichi/A-3113-2012","Miyazaki, Shuichi/0000-0003-3849-4176",,,,17,38,38,0,8,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0957-4530,,,J MATER SCI-MATER M,J.

The purpose of this study was to provide a precise, three-dimensional evaluation of soft-tissue response to surface modifications in both implantation and expansion. Expandable 100-cc prostheses were designed with one of three surfaces: textured silicone (Biocell), standard smooth silicone, or polyurethane (Natural-Y, Meme). A new submuscular implantation site in the rabbit was developed. Each animal randomly received a smooth-surface device on one side and either a textured silicone or polyurethane device on the other. In one group of animals, the prostheses were expanded monthly. Capsular response was evaluated monthly in vivo using standardized techniques as well as biomechanical methods for up to 6 months in the expander group (n = 7 to 16) and 8 months in the implant group (n = 7 to 15). Analysis of biomechanical and histologic data revealed that prosthetic surface morphology can specifically alter capsular response. Polyurethane was the only effective surface in preventing capsular contracture in implantation. In expansion, both textured silicone and polyurethane surfaces resulted in significantly less capsular contracture and less resistance to expansion than comparable smooth-surfaced controls. Statistical comparisons reveal that the biomechanical methods utilized in this study provide the most precise and objective method of defining overall soft-tissue contracture around implanted biomaterials.","MED COLL OHIO HOSP,DEPT PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG,TOLEDO,OH; ST VINCENTS MED CTR,TOLEDO,OH; VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT ORTHOPAED & REHABIL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240; VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PLAST SURG,NASHVILLE,TN 37240; BAPTIST HOSP,INST AESTHET & RECONSTRUCT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN; MEHARRY MED COLL,DEPT SURG,NASHVILLE,TN 37208",,,,,,,,30,92,96,0,5,WILLIAMS & WILKINS,BALTIMORE,"351 WEST CAMDEN ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21201-2436",0032-1052,,,PLAST RECONSTR SURG,Plast.

The mechanism by which this apparently trivial maneuver reduces platelet deposition was investigated. Polypropylene suture (7-0 Prolene) was passed through human arteries (fetal and adult), and platelet deposition to the suture was measured in a standardized perfusion chamber. Single vessel passage of the sutures reduced platelet deposition by 68+/-23%, which contrasts sharply with the power of prostaglandin E1 (1-mu-M PGE1 is sufficient to abolish platelet shape change and aggregation), which inhibited only 11% of platelet deposition to the sutures. Aspirin treatment of the vessel (to prevent PGI2 formation) or endothelial stripping (to remove the ability to produce nitric oxide) had no effect on the degree of inhibition. Passage of the suture through a vessel analogue (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) did not inhibit platelet deposition. I-125-fibrinogen adsorption to the suture after vessel passage was reduced to a degree similar to that of platelet deposition. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins eluted from vessel-passed sutures revealed bands at 66, 47, and 16 kd. Western blotting indicated the presence of large amounts of albumin and hemoglobin, a moderate amount of haptoglobin, and only trace amounts of fibrinogen. When sutures were exposed to each of these proteins in vitro before perfusion, albumin and hemoglobin were found to reproduce the effect of vessel passage alone on platelet deposition. We conclude that albumin and hemoglobin adsorb to sutures during their passage through the vessel subendothelium. This reduces the subsequent adsorption of fibrinogen from blood, thereby reducing the ability of platelets to attach to the suture.","UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT SURG, PITTSBURGH, PA 15261 USA; UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT PATHOL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15261 USA; MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT CHEM ENGN, HAMILTON L8S 4L8, ONTARIO, CANADA","JOHNSON, PC (reprint author), UNIV PITTSBURGH, DIV PLAST & RECONSTRUCT SURG, 676 SCAIFE HALL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15261 USA.",,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [R29 HL-45891],,,51,3,3,0,2,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596 USA",1049-8834,,,ARTERIOSCLER THROMB,Arterioscler.

After a 24-h exposure to the antibiotic viable bacteria adherent to the disc were removed and counted. Those data revealed that at shorter adherence times a larger percentage of the adherent organism were erradicated by antibiotic exposure, 83.6% versus 15.6% for 2-h and 12-h adherence times, respectively. Although a significant percent of the organisms were killed with short adherence times, the organism still persisted in the face of high concentrations of cephaloridine. Scanning electron micrographs of organism adherent for 2 and 12 h revealed distinct morphological changes in the extracellular matrix indicating increased matrix production with longer adherence. Thus, these data reveal that adherence to biomaterials provides a protected environment for the bacteria and the time an organism is adherent to a biomaterial surface prior to antibiotic exposure can also increase the organism's resistance to antibiotics.","KYUSHU UNIV, FAC MED, DEPT ORTHOPED SURG, FUKUOKA 812, JAPAN; MED SCI RES INST, SCI ADVISORY BOARD, KNOXVILLE, TN USA; MED SCI RES INST, HERNDON, VA USA",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",1045-4861,,,J APPL BIOMATER,J.

In an explant of a human left ventricular assist device (LVAD), intact total cellular RNA could be isolated in sufficient quantities for hybridization analyses with gene-specific probes to evaluate cell growth, cytoskeletal organization, and production of extracellular matrix proteins. Cells harvested from a 132-day implanted LVAD exhibited proliferative activity and expressed genes for fibronectin and collagen types I, III, and IV. In vitro studies revealed that endothelial cells cultured on two different segmented polyurethane biomaterials (Biomer and Tecoflex 60D) exhibited different patterns of gene expression that reflected differences in cell growth rates, morphology, and composition of the extracellular matrix. These methodologies provide a valuable approach for a detailed evaluation of: (1) the biocompatibility of cells colonizing implanted cardiac assist devices; and (2) the functionality of cells seeded onto biomaterials.","UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,SCH MED,DEPT CELL BIOL,55 LAKE AVE N,WORCESTER,MA 01655",,,,,,,,0,14,14,0,2,FUTURA PUBL CO,ARMONK,"135 BEDFORD RD, PO BOX 418, ARMONK, NY 10504-0418",0886-0440,,,J CARDIAC SURG,J.

Specimens were harvested after periods varying from 1 to 4 wk. It was shown that ALP-coupled DDS rapidly accumulated hydroxyapatite crystals. 4 wk after implantation, the content of calcium and phosphate per Microgram of hydroxyproline amounted up to 80 and 60%, respectively, of that found in normal bovine dentin.

The chemical was analyzed for different genotoxicity endpoints, to obtain both information on its possible mutagenic/carcinogenic potential and a model analysis of a tertiary arylamine, which belongs to a class of chemicals commonly used as polymerization accelerators in the biomaterial field. The genotoxicity endpoints considered were: gene mutation in the Salmonella test; structural and numerical chromosome alterations in Chinese hamster V79 cells, evaluated by the micronucleus test together with an immunofluorescent staining specific for kinetochore proteins; in vitro and in vivo DNA damage, evaluated in V79 cells and in mouse liver by the alkaline DNA elution technique. On the whole, the results indicate that N-acryloyl-N'-phenylpiperazine is to be regarded not so much as a DNA-damaging agent, but as a genomic mutagen. Indeed, it was not mutagenic in Salmonella (though its toxicity did not allow testing concentrations over 70-mu-g/plate), and it was weakly positive in inducing chromosomal fragmentation in vitro (one positive, not dose-related, result out of five different doses tested) and in vivo DNA damage (increases in DNA elution rate never doubling control values). The chemical was, however, clearly positive (with dose-dependent effects up to about 25 times the control value) in causing numerical chromosome alterations, at the maximal non-toxic doses.","UNIV GENOA,CIRC,INST ONCOL,I-16132 GENOA,ITALY; UNIV PERUGIA,DEPT HYG,I-06100 PERUGIA,ITALY; UNIV MILAN,DEPT BIOENGN,I-20133 MILAN,ITALY; CNR,IST MUTAGENESI & DIFFERENZIAMENTO,I-56100 PISA,ITALY","TANINGHER, M (reprint author), NATL INST CANC RES,VIALE BENEDETTO XV NO 10,I-16132 GENOA,ITALY.",,"Tanzi, Maria Cristina/I-4620-2013","Tanzi, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-4913-6633",,,,9,5,5,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8262,,,MUTAT RES,,JUN,1992.0,282.0,2,,,,,99,105,,10.1016/0165-7992(92)90081-R,,,,7,Genetics & Heredity; Toxicology,Genetics & Heredity; Toxicology,HY734,WOS:A1992HY73400007,1377358.0,,,,2019-02-25

There was good correlation between the cytotoxicity and the thickness of inflammatory layer. Histological findings showed that the inflammatory layer of radiation vulcanized natural rubber latex (RVNRL) films involved a slightly higher response than the negative implant at the 3rd post operative day although the inflammatory layer showed almost the same degree as the negative controls at the 7th day. The cytotoxic potential of the extracts prepared from RVNRL films was found to be weak by the colony assay. The hemolytic activity was also detected in the extracts of RVNRL films. The lysis of red blood cells and the release of haemoglobin was clearly caused by RVNRL film. Though the cytotoxic and tissue irritative activities of RVNRL are considered much weaker then sulfur-vulcanized latices, it was suggested that RVNRL contains some unknown substances showing weak toxicities including hemolysis.","PUBL WELFARE INST SCI RES,KOGANEI,JAPAN; KANAGAWA PREFECTURAL PUBL HLTH LABS,ASAHI KU,YAKOHAMA,KANAGAWA,JAPAN","TSUCHIYA, T (reprint author), NATL INST HYG SCI,KAMIYOGA 1-18-1,SETAGAYA KU,TOKYO 158,JAPAN.",,,,,,,8,10,10,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0146-5724,,,RADIAT PHYS CHEM,Radiat.

In the case of the in vitro test, a simple whole blood contacting procedure has been employed. The ex vivo once through test involves the exposing of NR-g-DMAA tubes with once through flow of fresh canine blood and then it was inspected for any evidence of clot. In the case of ex vivo loops test, the NR-g-DMAA tube was implanted at external jugular vein of a mongrel canine and the blood flow in the NR-g-DMAA tube was detected with an ultrasonic flow meter. It was found that the blood compatibility of NR-g-DMAA tubes is improved significantly with the increasing degree of grafting. All the NR-g-DMAA tubes having a degree of grafting of about 30 wt % or more exhibit good blood compatibility.

FRP composite fracture behavior and environmental interactions are distinctly different from those which occur in metals. These differences must be accounted for in the design and evaluation of implant performance. Fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength in a FRP composite is known to strongly influence fracture behavior. The interfacial bond strength of four candidate fiber/matrix combinations (carbon fiber/polycarbonate, carbon fiber/polysulfone, polyaramid fiber/polycarbonate, polyaramid fiber/polysulfone) were investigated at 37-degrees-C in dry and in vivo simulated (saline, exudate) environments. Ultimate bond strength was measured by a single fiber-microdroplet pull-out test. Dry bond strengths were significantly decreased following exposure to either saline or exudate with bond strength loss being approximately equal in both the saline and exudate. Bond strength loss is attributed to the diffusion of water and/or salt ions into the sample and their interaction with interfacial bonding. Because bond degradation is dependent upon diffusion, diffusional equilibrium must be obtained in composite test samples before the full effect of the test environment upon composite mechanical behavior can be determined.",,"LATOUR, RA (reprint author), CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOENGN,CLEMSON,SC 29634, USA.",,,,,,,32,20,20,0,2,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

The failure of the theory to predict the relationship between fracture toughness and molecular mass found experimentally for glass-ionomers and zinc polycarboxylates is noted.

The fibroblast is the major cell type; but also giant cells and macrophages are present, and their numbers are increased in the occasional adverse-type host reaction to the prosthesis. Adverse lytic reactions are often associated with methylmethacrylate debris, whereas in cementless cases, polyethylene and metallic (titanium) wear debris seem to cause adverse reactions. Osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal collagenase secreted by fibroblasts and macrophages play an important role in the process of prosthetic loosening. Methylmethacrylate is immunologically relatively inert, while it induces inflammatory mononuclear-cell migration. Both cemented and cementless prostheses cause a foreign-body type host response, including adaptive and reactive processes. This response includes the formation of fibroblast-like B-type lining cells, which are able to synthesize and secrete hyaluronate. Material surfaces of hip arthroplasty components also provide a unique environmental niche to which staphylococcal strains adhere and colonize. Antibiotic resistance is related to the material colonized rather than to the presence of an exopolysaccharide barrier, organisms bound to polyethylene and methylmethacrylate are more resistant than organisms that are bound to stainless steel. An understanding of prosthetic biocompatibility requires an appreciation of tissue cell, bacterial cell and host defense-system response to biomaterials. The site of implantation is a stage on which the ""players"" (bacteria, host cells, and organic moieties) interact and compete, and before which the host is a ""responsive audience.""","HOSP JOINT DIS & MED CTR, INST ORTHOPAED, NEW YORK, NY 10003 USA; MUSCULOSKELETAL SCI RES INST, HERNDON, VA USA","SANTAVIRTA, S (reprint author), INVALID FDN, HOSP ORTHOPED, TENHOLANTIE 10, SF-00280 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,73,51,52,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0001-6470,,,ACTA ORTHOP SCAND,Acta Orthop.

Peritoneal fluid cell attachment to oxidized regenerated cellulose and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was evaluated by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly elicited increased numbers of large, morphologically activated peritoneal fluid macrophages that adhered more rapidly and produced more hydrogen peroxide than controls. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene gradually increased the number of normal-appearing peritoneal fluid macrophages with increased hydrogen peroxide production but normal adherence. Macrophages rapidly attached to both materials in vivo, with oxidized regenerated cellulose being rapidly degraded.

Fibrinolytic activity was determined by fibrin degradation products (X-FDP's), complement activation by C3a and C5a, leucocyte activation by granulocyte elastase and contact activation by factor XII-like activity (FXIIA). Five patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery using a bubble oxygenator and pulsatile perfusion were studied. X-FDP's rose gradually during CPB and remained elevated. Similar patterns were observed for elastase and FXIIA. In contrast, C3a rose sharply with peak values at 1 1/2-2h of bypass while C5a did not show significant changes during bypass.

A variation in the percentage of Na2O from 0.9 to 15.0% was balanced by decreasing the SiO2 content of the network. The amounts of all other constituents of the eight-component glasses were kept constant. An attempt was made to incorporate a constant 16.5% K2O into the glass compositions. A total of 13, eight-component precursor powders were obtained by spray-drying followed by calcination and fusion in order to produce the final glass. Three samples of each eight-component glass were dissolved and analysed for each element using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) to obtain bulk chemical compositions. This investigation has clearly shown the content of Na2O begins to limit the K2O content. A Student-Newman-Keuls rank order test (SNK) showed that a significant decrease in the K2O content occurred from 4.2 to 15.0% Na2O. A linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the % K2O with Na2O in the glass (r = -0.925, p < 0.001).

The UHF band is favored from two aspects: the avoidance of thermal runaway and the uniformity of heating inhomogeneous material.

The square-aspect TE 111 cylindrical applicator is favored principally because it allows variation of the E-field orientation as required during the warming profile. An appropriate kidney phantom organ is described. It is used to obtain measured values of the overall efficiency of a TE 111 applicator. The efficiency values are found to fall steadily with increasing temperature from 85% at -40-degrees-C to 45% at the phase change, mainly due to the decreasing tan delta-value of the phantom material.","UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT SURG,MRC,MED CRYOBIOL GRP,CAMBRIDGE CB2 2AH,ENGLAND","EVANS, S (reprint author), UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT ENGN,CAMBRIDGE CB2 1PZ,ENGLAND.",,,,Wellcome Trust,,,10,10,11,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394",0018-9294,,,IEEE T BIO-MED ENG,IEEE Trans.

To develop vascular grafts that resist thrombotic occlusion, a radio frequency glow discharge (RFGD) process was employed to modify the surface of existing graft materials. Ultrathin coatings of RFGD polymers of ethylene (E), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) were deposited on the lumen of Dacron grafts. Surfaces were characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The effect of glow discharge treatments on platelet-graft interactions was evaluated in an ex vivo baboon shunt model. Following placement of an untreated or RFGD-treated graft in the shunt, deposition of 111Indium-labeled platelets was monitored for 60 min by gamma camera imaging. Untreated Dacron rapidly accumulated large numbers of platelets, reaching a plateau in 60 min. HMDS- and TFE-treated Dacron had significantly lower levels of platelet deposition compared to the untreated control. In contrast, the ethylene treatment of Dacron augmented platelet deposition, making it the most platelet-adherent surface studied. In vitro studies were also performed using untreated and RFGD-treated poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) coverslips. ESCA verified that the surface composition of the untreated and RFGD-treated coverslips were virtually identical to their untreated and treated Dacron graft counterparts. Samples were incubated in washed baboon platelet suspensions for 2 h at 37-degrees-C. Platelet adhesion on the untreated PET was relatively high, and many of the platelets had a completely spread morphology. The HMDS and TFE treatment of PET reduced the number of adherent platelets and prevented platelet spreading on the surface. Platelet adhesion and spreading on the ethylene-treated surface was the highest among the four studied.

Clinical and biological tolerances were satisfactory. There was one case of early local infection. Gross and microscopic examinations performed between 7 days and 9 months after implantation showed degradation of the prosthetic mesh and connective tissue growth into the implant mimicking dura mater as early as 15 days after implantation. There was no attendant inflammatory reaction or cortical adhesions or other adverse reactions.

Using an accurate and sensitive method to quantify glycocalyx and bacterial adherence, we have demonstrated that the producer of the most glycocalyx also exhibited the highest adherence index, whereas low producers exhibited the least (p < 0.01). Additionally, at various concentrations the high producer had the greater tendency to adhere and grow on stainless steel wires and tubes (p < 0.001). The adherence index, referred as the ratio of tritiated thymidine uptake on wires to colony forming units (CFU), was also the highest in high producers. The adherence index increased as the glycocalyx index increased. It was suggested that glycocalyx production enhanced the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to biomaterials and caused persistent and intractable infections. In short, the glycocalyx index and the adherence index can be reliable indices of biomaterial-centerted infection.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV, COLL MED, DEPT BACTERIOL, TAIPEI, TAIWAN","TSAI, CL (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV, COLL MED, DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG, TAIPEI, TAIWAN.",,,,,,,22,2,2,0,0,OKAYAMA UNIV MED SCHOOL,OKAYAMA,"EDITORIAL OFFICE, ACTA MEDICA OKAYAMA OKAYAMA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2-5-1 SHIKATA-CHO, KITA-KU, OKAYAMA, 700-8558, JAPAN",0386-300X,,,ACTA MED OKAYAMA,Acta Med.

Another important trend in such ""molecular bioengineering"" is to develop, perhaps via computer-aided molecular design, new artificial biomimetic systems by exact placement of functional groups on rigid polymer backbones, cross-linked structures, or macromolecular assemblies. In this way, biocatalytic functioning or biorecognition similar to enzymes and antibodies can be achieved without the inherent instability often encountered with the native biomolecules or assemblies. Perhaps the most exciting trend in biomaterials research and development is the availability of new biomolecules, e.g., via protein engineering and of hardy cells with specific biofunctions and bioresponses that can be tailored to specific medical or biotechnological needs. The wide variety of ways that such biomolecules and cells can be combined with polymeric biomaterials provides tremendously exciting opportunities for the biomaterials scientists and engineers. In addition to these synthetic approaches, new and exciting analytical tools, such as the scanning tunneling microscope and the atomic force microscope, are permitting study on a molecular scale of individual and small clusters of proteins and other biomolecular assemblies on surfaces. Cell attachments and spreading may also be visualized at various depths within the cell using the confocal laser microscope. Such analytical techniques can lead to important new knowledge about biologic interactions with biomaterials and, therefore, to development of even more biocompatible implants and devices. This paper overviews the present state of polymeric biomaterials and highlights the important and exciting opportunities generated by the liaison of these materials with molecular biology.",,"HOFFMAN, AS (reprint author), UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR BIOENGN,MOLEC BIOENGN PROGRAM,FL-20,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,,,,,,62,27,29,1,5,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0160-564X,,,ARTIF ORGANS,Artif.

Human peripheral blood neutrophils were incubated with cobalt-base alloy (F-75) or polystyrene beads of a nonphagocytosable size. Respiratory burst activity was studied by measuring superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of cytochrome C. Neutrophils were found to release no more superoxide anion on incubation for up to 3 h with either material in a protein-free medium than controls without foreign material. However, the ability of neutrophils incubated with either biomaterial to subsequently respond to phorbol myristate acetate challenge was decreased (p < 0.05). Chemical analysis of supernatants for the F-75 samples showed a high concentration of cobalt in the medium within 1 h of incubation. Minimal chromium and nickel was detected. No correlation could be demonstrated between metal in solution and the respiratory burst defect in neutrophils. Instead it appears that interaction of cells with either surface was the critical event in altering the response to phorbol myristate acetate. This observed functional defect may play an important role in rendering tissue around implanted biomaterials susceptible to infections.","CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOENGN,CLEMSON,SC 29634; CLEMSON UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,CLEMSON,SC 29634",,,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [5R01 AR39334],,,33,49,50,0,1,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Often these infections are caused by low-virulence organisms or by a mixture of organisms (polymicrobial). In this study two methods were used to quantitate the bacteria which had adhered to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples. The bacteria were eluted from the sample using an ultrasonic cleaner. The number eluted was then counted by colony counts, which determines viable organisms and by particle counting which counts both viable and nonviable organisms. A known adherent strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and a strain of Proteus mirabilis were used. In general the adherence of S. epidermidis was greater than that of Proteus. When the two organisms were used together, there was an alteration in the adherence pattern which generally increased the adherence of Proteus and had no effect or decreased the adherence of S. epidermidis. The use of both quantitation techniques provided important information on the adherence of organisms to PMMA to which gentamicin had been added. It was evident that organisms did adhere to the PMMA plus gentamicin samples but were not viable when eluted. The amount of adherence to PMMA plus gentamicin was similar to that of PMMA alone at 30 min but was markedly decreased at 24 h. There was a considerable dead biofilm mass on the PMMA plus gentamicin samples which might be a significant promoter of late infections by providing a surface attractive to other strains of bacteria.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,20,55,58,0,6,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

New developments in manufacturing biomaterials have encouraged the use of biological and biosynthetic materials for both arterial replacement and bypass procedures. We have analyzed in vivo the process of neovascularization and incorporation of biolized bovine carotid artery (Solco P(R)), a biological material, and the composite of ovine collagen and polyester mesh (Omniflow(R)), a biosynthetic material. The synthetic fabric polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE), which is widely used in cardiovascular surgery, served as control. Using the dorsal skinfold chamber of the Syrian golden hamster as site for implantation (n = 15), angiogenesis and neovascularization were analyzed quantitatively by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy. In each chamber a piece (approximately 1 mm2) of each of the three vascular grafts was implanted. Five days after implantation neovascularization was ascertained in 90% of the Omniflow(R) grafts, while only 40% of the PTFE and 20% of the Solco P(R) implants revealed new ingrowing microvessels. On day 10 the density of newly formed microvessels was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in Omniflow(R) grafts (263.5 +/- 24.1 cm-1) as compared to PTFE (134.2 +/- 20.8 cm-1) and Solco P(R) (153.2 +/- 32.O cm1). In addition, the biosynthetic composite revealed a larger extension of neovascularization into the perigraft tissue, and 12 days after implantation these grafts were most tightly incorporated. Failure of neovascularization of Solco P(R) was associated with remarkable fibrous collagen thickening, Superior neovascularization of Omniflow(R) might be due to the additional loose polyester mesh support of the material and potentially due to prevention of fibrous collagen thickening.","TECH UNIV MUNICH,INST ANAT,W-8000 MUNICH 2,GERMANY","MENGER, MD (reprint author), UNIV MUNICH,INST SURG RES,MARCHIONINISTR 15,W-8000 MUNICH 70,GERMANY.",,,,,,,39,33,33,0,2,GEORG THIEME VERLAG,STUTTGART,"P O BOX 30 11 20, D-70451 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0171-6425,,,THORAC CARDIOV SURG,Thorac.

We found, that Ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. The same can be said about the last materials and E. coli. In contrast as well Ca- and P-containing as - free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. Canges of multiplying of S. aureus and Sc. salivarius seldom were observed. It ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. This may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. It is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application.

Principal advantages of SIMS include high detection sensitivity, high depth resolution, isotope specificity, and possibilities for three-dimensional imaging. Current limitations, especially in comparison to X-ray microanalysis, center on lateral spatial resolution and quantification. Recent SIMS instrumentation advances involving field emission liquid metal ion sources and laser post-ionization will help to minimize these limitations in the future. The molecular surface analysis capabilities of static SIMS, especially with the new developments in commercial time-of-flight spectrometers, are promising for application to biomimetic, biomaterials, and biological tissue or cell surfaces. However, the direct microchemical imaging of biomolecules in tissue samples using SIMS will be hindered by limited concentrations, small analytical volumes, and the inefficiencies of converting surface molecules to structurally significant gas phase ions. Indirect detection using elemental or isotopically tagged molecules, however, shows considerable promise for molecular imaging studies using SIMS ion microscopy.",,"LINTON, RW (reprint author), UNIV N CAROLINA, DEPT CHEM, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27599 USA.",,,,,,,210,40,40,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0248-4900,1768-322X,,BIOL CELL,Biol.

The mortality of mice was directly proportional to the silica content of the glass injected intraperitoneally.

The polyurethane materials tested were: Vascugraft(R) (fibrous, open pore structure); commercial Hydrophilic Mitrathane(R) prosthesis (high porosity, smooth surface, non-permeable, closed pore structure); experimental hydrophobic Mitrathane (less porosity but a fibrous, open pore structure, similar to Vascugraft). The commercial expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses Impra(R) and reinforced GORETEX(R) were included as controls on account of their extensive clinical application in the femoropopliteal position. After 5 d incubation at 37-degrees-C biocompatibility was assessed in terms of average area of migrating cells on the biomaterial, total number of cells surrounding the explant and level of adhesion between the cells and the biomaterial. The Vascugraft prosthesis promoted the growth of a continuous monolayer of cells on its surface. This behaviour was equivalent to Impra and reinforced GORETEX materials in terms of cell density and area of cell migration but appeared to be superior for cell adhesion.

PAAs having primary amino, or secondary amino end-groups were directly grafted on the surface of PEUAm sheets. For vinyl-terminated chains an alpha, OMEGA-amino-polyether spacer was introduced initially, following the same addition mechanism. Ungrafted and grafted materials were characterized, besides other analytical techniques, by ATR FT-IR spectroscopy. The heparin adsorption on PEAUm films was analysed after its elution from heparinized samples, quantified by coagulation tests (aPTT), and related to the presence of the PAAs chains grafted on to the surface.

The binding of C3 (central component of complement) and B (factor B, an activator of C3) and H (factor H, an inhibitor of C3 activation) plays a crucial role in the activation of the alternative pathway of complement on the surfaces of biomaterials during extracorporeal procedures. Here we report on the adsorption of C3, B or H on to the silica surface with a hydrophobicity gradient. The amount of native I-125-C3 bound to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was very similar (0.8 and 0.9-mu-g/cm2; 4 x 10(-12) mol/cm2). Neither factor H nor factor B was able to displace already adsorbed I-125-C3 from either of the surfaces. The extent of binding of factors B and H to preadsorbed C3 was a function of the surface hydrophobicity: more I-125-B or I-125-H was bound to C3 adsorbed at the hydrophilic end than at the hydrophobic end of the gradient surface. The binding of I-125-B or I-125-H to preadsorbed C3 appeared to be influenced by the availability of their binding sites on adsorbed C3 molecules rather than by the amount of surface-bound C3. At the hydrophobic end of the gradient surface the molar binding ratio of B/C3 was considerably smaller than the molar binding ratio of H/C3. It can be speculated that the hydrophobicity of the surface determines orientation and/or conformation of adsorbed C3 molecule; when adsorbed at the hydrophobic end of the gradient, C3 molecule predominantly exposes the binding site to which only factor H can bind. A substantial decrease in binding of C3, B or H on to the hydrophobicity gradient surface was observed in the presence of other serum or plasma proteins, particularly at the hydrophobic end of the gradient surface.","UNIV UTAH,DEPT BIOENGN,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112; UNIV UTAH,DEPT PATHOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112; UNIV UTAH,DEPT MAT SCI & ENGN,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112; UNIV UTAH,CTR BIOPOLYMERS INTERFACES,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112",,,,,NIAID NIH HHS [AI 19319],,,26,35,35,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,8,,,,,497,504,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JC846,WOS:A1992JC84600002,1321678.0,,,,2019-02-25

All four polylactide particulates aggregated and intermingled with inflammatory cells. The aggregates remained throughout the investigation period of 6 months. Quantitative measurements showed that standardization of the particle form and size is essential. From this study and other experiments in which calcium phosphates and asbestos were injected intraperitoneally, it is concluded that the inflammatory response observed in the peritoneal cavity is related to the type of material injected and probably to form and size of the individual particles, but not to molecular weight.","LEIDEN UNIV HOSP,ELECTRON MICROSCOPY LAB,BIOMAT RES GRP,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS","VANSLIEDREGT, A (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV HOSP,DEPT BIOMAT,OTOBIOL & BIOCOMPATIBIL LAB,RIJNSBURGERWEG 10,2333 AA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,"van Blitterswijk, Clemens/0000-0003-2371-4615",,,,21,16,16,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,12,,,,,819,824,,10.1016/0142-9612(92)90174-M,,,,6,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JV211,WOS:A1992JV21100002,1457674.0,,,,2019-02-25

The effect of electrostatic forces on the rheology of injectable collagen was studied by observation of the birefringence of collagen fibres through a polarizing microscope as well as by oscillatory rheological measurements on dispersions of varying ionic strengths (0.06-0.30). The birefringence of fibres progressively increased as ionic strength was reduced from 0.30 to 0.06. The linear viscoelastic measurements displayed a logarithmic relationship between storage (and loss) moduli and frequency over oscillation frequencies of 0.1-100 rad/s. The associated relaxation time spectra, interpreted using the theory of Kamphuis et al. for concentrated dispersions, show that collagen fibres become more flexible as ionic strength increases. This result was analysed at the molecular level from the perspective that collagen fibres are a liquid-crystalline phase of rigid rod collagen molecules which have phase-separated from solution. Electrostatic forces affect the volume fraction of water present in the collagen fibres which in turn alters the rigidity of the fibres. Flexible collagen fibre dispersions displayed emulsion-like flow properties whereas more rigid collagen fibre dispersions displayed suspension-like flow properties. Changes in fibre rigidity significantly alter the injectability of collagen dispersions which is critical in clinical performance.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT CHEM ENGN,BERKELEY,CA 94720; CELTRIX LABS INC,PALO ALTO,CA 94303","ROSENBLATT, J (reprint author), UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM ENGN,CATONSVILLE,MD 21228, USA.",,,,,,,34,17,17,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,12,,,,,878,886,,10.1016/0142-9612(92)90182-N,,,,9,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JV211,WOS:A1992JV21100010,1457682.0,,,,2019-02-25

In previous in vitro studies we could discriminate primary, i.e. extractable, and secondary cytotoxicity, due to cell-biomaterial interactions, i.e. enzymatic actions. To develop dermal sheep collagen for clinical applications, we focused in this study on the release, e.g. elimination, of secondary cytotoxicity over time. We used the universal 7 d methylcellulose cell culture with human skin fibroblasts as a test system. Hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen and glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen were tested, with intervals of 6 d, over a culture period of 42 d. With hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, cytotoxicity, i.e. cell growth inhibition and deviant cell morphology, was eliminated after 18 d of exposure. When testing glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, the bulk of cytotoxic products was released after 6 d, but a continuous low secondary cytotoxicity was measured up to 42 d. As a control, non-cross-linked dermal-sheep collagen was tested over a period of 36 d, but no secondary cytotoxic effects were observed. The differences in release of secondary cytotoxicity between hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen and non-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen are explained from differences in cross-linking agents and cross-links obtained. We hypothesize that secondary cytotoxicity results from enzymatic release of pendant molecules from hexamethylenediisocyanate-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, e.g. formed after reaction of hydrolysis products of hexamethylenediisocyanate with dermal sheep collagen. Glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen contains residual cross-linking agents, which induce the bulk cytotoxicity. Apart from being sensitive to enzymatic degradation, glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen was also found to be sensitive to aqueous hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of cross-links may release cytotoxic products and introduce new pendant molecules within glutaraldehyde-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen, which in turn induce cytotoxicity after enzymatic attack.","TWENTE UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT CHEM TECHNOL, 7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS","VANLUYN, MJA (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL, BIOMAT RES SECT, OOSTERSINGEL 69-2, 9713 EZ GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.",,"Dijkstra, Pieter/N-9328-2013",,,,,25,64,64,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,,1992.0,13.0,14,,,,,1017,1024,,10.1016/0142-9612(92)90153-F,,,,8,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,JY793,WOS:A1992JY79300007,1472588.0,,,,2019-02-25

Microstructure of mica glass-ceramics has been studied by electron replica and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques. Mica glass-ceramics have previously been developed in SiO2-B2O3-Al2O3-MgO-F--base glasses. The material is machinable because of the precipitation of micas of fluorophlogopite-type. Also, a machinable glass-ceramic for dental applications was developed based on KMg2.5(Si4O10)F2-micas. We developed mica glass-ceramics in the SiO2-Al2O3-MgO-Na2O-K2O-F glass system. Phase formation within these glasses was observed by SEM. A double controlled nucleation and crystallization of mica and apatite crystals was possible in glasses of the SiO2-MgO-Na2O-K2O-F-CaO-P2O5-(Al2O3) system. The main crystal phases of phlogopite-type were characterized by SEM and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and apatite crystals Ca5(PO4)3(OH,F) were analyzed by X-ray diffraction measurements. The glass-ceramics are useful biomaterials for bone substitution. EDS analysis shows the ion exchange between glass-ceramics and body fluids. The interface reaction is characterized by formation of a small phosphate layer, and particularly by alkali ion exchange.","UNIV JENA,O-6900 JENA,GERMANY","HOLAND, W (reprint author), IVOCLAR AG,BENDERERSTR 2,FL-9494 SCHAAN,LIECHTENSTEIN.",,,,,,,30,11,11,2,9,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1992.0,2.0,2,,,,,105,112,,,,,,8,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,JU596,WOS:A1992JU59600002,,,,,2019-02-25

Following substrates were analyzed to compare these two different culture techniques: bovine serum albumin, pig-skin gelatin and albumin + gelatin cross-linked by glutaraldehyde or carbodiimide, fibrin glue and negative control (Thermanox(R)). Parameters of cell growth and adhesion were calculated and compared with electron microscopic observations of cell morphology and of the extracellular matrix. Both culture methods provided complementary results and led to a similar classification of the biomaterials. However, the cell culture method exhibited a higher sensitivity to the surface properties of biomaterials which limited further experimentation. This was well illustrated by glutaraldehyde cross-linked protein membranes which did not support the growth of dispersed cells but enabled the formation of a cellular tissue in organ culture, thus allowing a cytocompatibility assessment. Endothelial cell morphology and extracellular matrix elaborated on biomaterials were compared to chicken blood vessels. Both methods showed that cells grown on fibrin glue and on gelatin or albumin + gelatin cross-linked by carbodiimide had a microscopic morphology similar to that of vessel wall.

Many different techniques have been developed for this purpose, most of which appeared to be unsatisfactory. The lack of sufficient tissue requires the insertion of prosthetic material. Non-absorbable prostheses used to reconstruct abdominal wall defects showed the best results. Polypropylene mesh (PPM) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) soft-tissue patch are the most frequently used materials for this purpose. However, PPM induces extensive visceral adhesions and erosion of the skin, whereas ePTFE is insufficiently anchored to the adjacent tissue and therefore both materials are not ideal. As a result of own clinical and experimental studies, we constructed a new prosthesis that combines the favourable properties and avoids the drawbacks of PPM and ePTFE and tested it in an experimental study in the rat. The results are promising and warrant future study to find the ideal non-absorbable prosthesis to reconstruct large abdominal wall defects.","TWENTEBORG HOSP,DEPT SURG,ALMELO,NETHERLANDS; UNIV GRONINGEN,CTR BIOMED TECHNOL,9700 AB GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS","SIMMERMACHER, RKJ (reprint author), SOPHIA HOSP,DEPT SURG,DR VAN HEESWEG 2,8025 AB ZWOLLE,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,112,10,10,0,5,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1992.0,2.0,4,,,,,281,290,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,KP120,WOS:A1992KP12000002,,,,,2019-02-25

Structural changes such as spreading will vary depending on the substrate involved. Although platelet structural changes following adhesion have been recorded, the cellular mechanisms including changes in intracellular calcium flux underlying these platelet responses are less well understood. In this study, video microscopy was used to image platelet adhesion and spreading while simultaneously imaging intracellular free Ca2+ levels in individual Fura-2 loaded human platelets. This was accomplished using fluorescence video microscopy coupled with video enhanced asymmetric illumination contrast (AIC) to image Ca2+ transients and correlative electron microscopy to image associated structural changes in individual platelets contacting glass and polyvinyl formal, formvar, substrates. Three main points were concluded from this study: 1) Intracellular Ca2+ levels increase with surface-induced activation on either formvar or glass. 2) In partially spread or fully spread platelets, intracellular Ca2+ decreases to a steady state value. 3) Platelet-platelet contact leads to intracellular Ca2+ transients.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT ANIM HLTH & BIOMED SCI,1655 LINDEN DR,MADISON,WI 53706; UNIV WISCONSIN,MAT SCI PROGRAM,MADISON,WI 53706; UNIV ILORIN,DEPT PHARMACOL,ILORIN,NIGERIA",,,,,,,,27,4,4,1,6,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1992.0,2.0,4,,,,,299,308,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,KP120,WOS:A1992KP12000004,,,,,2019-02-25

Investigators have shown that the superimposition of multiple tissue layers can cause errors with both the morphologic observations and the histometric measurements of bone. The objective of this study was to document errors in the bone mineral content measurements associated with overlapping tissues. Using a digital image analysis system, microradiographic and BSE images from canine cortical and cancellous bone were captured and analyzed. The results of this study showed that microradiography had more projection effect errors associated with the morphology and histometry. The BSE technique provided substantially better resolution of the bone morphology and showed significantly more (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) bone surface perimeter than the microradiographic technique. Contrary to the literature, the BSE images did not show less bone area than the microradiographic images of the identical regions. This discrepancy was explained by projection effect errors and over penetration artifacts of the X-ray beam. Unique to this study was the documentation that microradiography has inherent projection effect errors associated with mineral content measurements. The BSE images had significantly more (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) graylevels present than the microradiographic images. Due to the limited tissue overlap, the BSE images provide excellent morphologic resolution, accurate bone histometry and the ability to accurately measure the mineral content of cortical and cancellous bone at a microscopic level.",,"BACHUS, KN (reprint author), VET ADM MED CTR,BONE & JOINT RES LABS 151F,500 FOOTHILL BLVD,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84148, USA.",,,,,,,78,23,24,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1992.0,2.0,4,,,,,347,355,,,,,,9,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,KP120,WOS:A1992KP12000008,,,,,2019-02-25

The surfactant is first deposited on the polymer surface via a solvent swelling and evaporation method. Then the coated surfactant is immobilized on the substrate surface by an inert gas discharge treatment. ESCA and water contact angle (theta) measurements on treated and solvent washed surfaces show significant increases in both surface O/C ratios and surface water wettability (theta < 30-degrees) compared to LDPE control surfaces, revealing the presence of PEO on the treated surfaces. A great reduction of fibrinogen adsorption on the modified surfaces is also observed for the highest PEO content surfactants.

We previously developed an in vitro assay to study the Staphylococcus aureus adhesion-promoting effect of surface-adsorbed fibronectin on flat PMMA coverslips coated with a monolayer amount of fibronectin. We screened the potential anti-adhesive properties of a group of substituted dextrans, previously shown to exhibit potent anticoagulant and anticomplementary activities. In comparison to unsubstituted dextran which showed no significant (<20%) adhesion inhibition at 1 mg/ml, dextrans increasingly substituted with carboxylic and benzylamide groups (CMBD) exhibited increasing anti-adhesive activities. Three CMBD derivatives showing an increasing proportion (5-14%) of benzylamide groups showed inhibition of bacterial adhesion increasing from 33 to 51% at 1 mg/ml. Another category of substituted dextrans having a variable proportion (2-26%) of sulfonated benzylamide groups (CMBDS) produced active inhibition of S. aureus adhesion. In comparison to these heparin-like dextran derivatives, native heparin produced inhibition values of S. aureus adhesion which were intermediate between those of CMBD and CMBDS compounds. Further ore, the anti-adhesive activity was still expressed when substituted dextrans were preincubated with fibronectin-coated PMMA but washed away at the time when radiolabeled bacteria were added to the adhesion assay. This indicates that the anti-adhesive effects of CMBDS could be exerted at the level of the S. aureus binding site of fibronectin. In conclusion, S. aureus adhesion on fibronectin-coated biomaterials can be efficiently blocked in vitro by soluble compounds such as dextran derivatives.","UNIV PARIS 13,RECH MACROMOLEC LAB,CNRS,URA 502,F-93430 VILLETANEUSE,FRANCE","VAUDAUX, P (reprint author), HOP CANTONAL GENEVA,DEPT MED,DIV MALAD INFECT,CH-1211 GENEVA 4,SWITZERLAND.",,"Didier, letourneur/H-5268-2012","Didier, letourneur/0000-0003-2197-9468",,,,24,21,21,0,3,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Copolymers, SE8.5, is composed of polystyrene with 8.5 mol% of monoamine side chains, and SED8, which is with 8 mol% of diamine side chains, were estimated to contain almost the same amount of protonated amino groups in bulk composition at physiological pH (pH 7.4). There observed significant difference in cellular spreading of attached endothelial cells between these two types of copolymer surfaces. Spreading-% of attached cells on SED8 surfaces was approximately 1.6 times greater than that on SE8.5 6 h after seeding. This difference in cellular spreading influenced to subsequent cell growth. Cellular growth on each polymer surface was featured by parameter k, which corresponds to the 'rate constant' of cellular proliferation. While the k-value for SE8.5 decreased with decreasing seeding density as well as the case for polystyrene, SED8 maintained a high k-value even at low seeding density as 2 x 10(3) cells/cm2.

This was achieved by constructing a novel test chamber permitting the contact of small amounts of blood with a large geometrical test surface. The construction consists of a spiral-shaped flow channel of 0.3 cm width, 0.02 cm height and 78 cm length covered with the biomaterials to be tested from both sides. Laminarity of blood flow in the conduit was confirmed theoretically by the calculation of an equivalent to the Reynolds number for curved systems the so-called Dean number. Furthermore, flow laminarity was proved experimentally finding that the flow rate of blood with different hematocrit values was proportional to the hydrostatic pressure applied. The applicability of the novel 'spiral method' for the estimation of hemocompatibility was demonstrated by evaluation of platelet adhesion onto different polymers in comparison to siliconized and fibrinogen coated glass as reference surfaces. Additionally, it was possible under distinct conditions to determine the adhesion of leucocytes and the detachment of platelet aggregates. Therefore, it was concluded that the spiral method can be used for the assessment of the hemocompatibility of flat biomedical polymers. As main advantages of the new method can be considered the high time efficiency and accuracy without labelling or optical detection of adherent cells.","UNIV SOFIA, FAC CHEM, BU-1126 SOFIA, BULGARIA","GROTH, T (reprint author), HUMBOLDT UNIV, SCH MED, BIOMAT RES UNIT TUCHOLSKYSTR 2, O-1040 BERLIN, GERMANY.",,,"Groth, Thomas/0000-0001-6647-9657",,,,30,7,7,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0920-5063,1568-5624,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Preadsorption of a terpolymer of acrylonitrile, poly(ethyleneoxide) methacrylate and trimethylaminoethyl chloride methacrylate leads to very efficient passivation with respect to platelet accumulation and fibrinogen adsorption. In human ex vivo tests, evaluation of complement peptide C3a, platelet beta-thromboglobulin, leucocyte-polymorphonuclear neutrophile elastase and fibrinopeptide A shows no detectable activation. Furthermore, preadsorption appears to result in simultaneous improvement in hemocompatibility of the blood lines leading to and from the dialysis module.

Their biocompatibility has not been evaluated so far. In this study, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) containing various amounts of adrenochrome-melanin were synthesized and the cytotoxicity of their aqueous ""tracts was assessed by using four in vitro testing techniques (trypan blue dye exclusion, inhibition of DNA synthesis, lactate dehydrogenase release, and inhibition of cell growth). Assays were based on incubation with human choroidal fibroblasts. By the first three techniques, no cytotoxicity was found in the extracts. The inhibition of cell growth test showed a slight cellular protein loss, however only in the extracts of polymers with high melanin content. The results suggest that the release of potentially toxic agents from melanized hydrogels into an aqueous medium is not significant. However, when an assay in collagen gel was carried out in the presence of specimens of melanized hydrogels, a toxic reaction was clearly revealed. This can be caused by a delayed release of toxic molecules from melanin, or by some other mechanism. The use of melanin-containing polymers as implant materials becomes questionable and further research is necessary.",,"CHIRILA, TV (reprint author), LIONS EYE INST,2 VERDUN ST,BLOCK A,2ND FLOOR,NEDLANDS,WA 6009,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,55,13,13,1,8,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

Their output current was observed in parallel with measurements of plasma glucose concentrations and their function was checked by means of induced alterations in glycaemia. After between 14 and 96 h the experiments were terminated due to losses in the apparent sensitivity of implanted sensors and/or increasing oscillations following stable measurements. This was accompanied by an inflammatory reaction which was analysed on the basis of the clinical picture and histology. In most cases there was a bacterial ingrowth from the normal skin flora of dogs. The inflammatory exsudate contained only 23 +/- 17% of the simultaneous steady state plasma glucose concentration, which was significantly different from the glucose level in the fluid obtained from non-irritate subcutaneous tissue (95 +/- 12%, separate set of experiments). The in vitro calibration of sensors exhibited essentially comparable sensitivities before and after the in vivo application. No differences in reported findings related to the biomaterials used (polyurethane versus cellulose acetate), the presence of diabetes, the history of individual electrodes and the effective duration of a given experiment were discernible. We conclude that the functional bioinstability of subcutaneous glucose sensors is largely due to the inflammatory tissue reaction which alters the effective glucose concentration within the measuring compartment of the electrodes; these drawbacks may be overcome by further miniaturization including implantable telemetric devices allowing the closure of the skin.","UNIV GREIFSWALD,DEPT ANAT,O-2200 GREIFSWALD,GERMANY","REBRIN, K (reprint author), INST DIABET GERHARDT KATSCH,O-2201 KARLSBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,,,42,69,70,0,10,BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0141-5425,,,J BIOMED ENG,J.

Autologous materials are preferred; however, the harvesting procedure, donor site, and its associated morbidity are the disadvantages of using autografts. There are numerous types of alloplastic implants and they all differ in how they interact with host tissues. Factors such as implant texture, ability to integrate with host tissues, and rate of resorption all influence the overall success of different implants. In this article, we discuss some considerations in the use of biologic grafts and alloplastic implants in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.","UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT OTOLARYNGOL HEAD & NECK SURG MC648, CHICAGO, IL 60612 USA",,,,,,,,80,5,5,0,1,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1050-6934,1940-4379,,J LONG-TERM EFF MED,J.

The most common surgical tissue adhesives available to the surgeon include the cyanoacrylate derivatives and the fibrin tissue adhesives. Butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl(R)) is a cyanoacrylate derivative that is frequently used in Canada and Europe. This adhesive has excellent binding strength for skin closure; however, subcutaneous implantation can result in inflammation and foreign body giant cell reaction. Fibrin tissue adhesives use a fibrin clot as the binding moiety and vary in adhesive strength depending on the fibrinogen concentration of the preparation. Autologous fibrin tissue adhesives are prepared using one of several different methods, which vary in fibrinogen yield and concentration. The currently available autologous fibrin tissue adhesives demonstrate good hemostatic properties with relatively low binding strengths.

Type I-A bioerodible matrices reported in the past degrade either too slowly or too rapidly. The rate of erosion, therefore, has no influence on the kinetics of release. This paper reports kinetics of release of theophylline from a series of crosslinked glassy/swollen hydrogel matrices based on a novel crosslinking monomer, viz. 2-hydroxyethyl glycolate dimethacrylate. The release of theophylline in an alkaline medium is accompanied by the erosion of the crosslinks. Under appropriate conditions, theophylline is released at a constant rate by the erosion of the crosslinks in the bulk of the swollen polymer as well as by the surface erosion of the glassy polymer. The release behaviour has been explained on the basis of the concept of time-dependent diffusivity of the active ingredient and swelling-controlled zero-order release, respectively.","NATL CHEM LAB,DIV CHEM ENGN,POLYMER SCI & ENGN GRP,POONA 411008,MAHARASHTRA,INDIA",,,,,,,,20,13,13,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0032-3861,,,POLYMER,Polymer,,1992.0,33.0,3,,,,,593,599,,10.1016/0032-3861(92)90737-H,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,HD394,WOS:A1992HD39400019,,,,,2019-02-25

For the samples with higher TDI to PPG ratio, a decrease in ultimate elongation and an increase in tensile strength were observed. Addition of chain extender caused an increase in both. On the other hand, the ultimate elongation increased and tensile strength decreased with an increase in molecular weight of the PPG used. As the chemical compositions are changed by increasing the polyol content, an increase in oxygen permeability is also observed.","MIDDLE E TECH UNIV,DEPT CHEM,ANKARA 06531,TURKEY",,,,"HASIRCI, Nesrin/0000-0002-4497-0194",,,,15,22,22,1,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0032-3861,,,POLYMER,Polymer,,1992.0,33.0,10,,,,,2084,2088,,10.1016/0032-3861(92)90874-V,,,,5,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,HW559,WOS:A1992HW55900009,,,,,2019-02-25

The conditions at which the graft polymerization proceeded with a suitable yield were determined. Ammonium ferrous sulphate (Mohr's salt), as an inhibitor, failed to inhibit the homopolymerization of NVP during the radiation grafting process. In contrast, the addition of Cu2Cl2 (0.5 wt%) effectively inhibited the homopolymerization process and smooth grafted films with suitable grafting yield were obtained. The grafting onto PFA films, which scarcely swell in any solvent or monomer, was critically controlled by the diffusivity of reactants through the grafted layers initially formed near the film surface. The addition of ZnCl2 (3 wt%) to the monomer solution slightly enhanced the grafting and much smoother grafted films were obtained. The dependence of initial rate of grafting on NVP concentration was of the order 0.54. The graft copolymer possessed good mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical stability. Such non-ionic supported hydrogel on fluorinated polymer may be of interest for some practical use in which high electrical conductivity is not required, as in biomaterials.","AIN SHAMS UNIV,COLL WOMEN,CAIRO,EGYPT","HEGAZY, ESA (reprint author), NATL CTR RADIAT RES & TECHNOL,POB 29,CAIRO,EGYPT.",,,,,,,20,15,15,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0032-3861,,,POLYMER,Polymer,,1992.0,33.0,20,,,,,4230,4235,,10.1016/0032-3861(92)90262-U,,,,6,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JU316,WOS:A1992JU31600002,,,,,2019-02-25

This Bioregister is a so-called ""spontaneous"" ad hoc recording system whose efficiency depends largely on the collaboration of physicians. Thus, the efficiency and rationality of the use of biomaterials can certainly be improved.

The putative enhancement of glutaraldehyde crosslinking by lysine was investigated in three model systems: bovine pericardium, collagen membranes, and bovine serum albumin. Repetitive sequential treatment of bovine pericardium with glutaraldehyde and lysine and finally with formaldehyde produced a matrix which, by the two criteria used (shrinkage temperature and urea/SDS soluble collagen), was shown to be more highly crosslinked than pericardium fixed in glutaraldehyde alone. Essentially the same results were obtained when membranes prepared from pepsin-soluble pericardial collagen were subjected to sequential glutaraldehyde and lysine treatments, reaching shrinkage temperatures of more than 90-degrees-C. Heart valves prepared from lysine-enhanced glutaraldehyde crosslinked bovine pericardium were tested in vitro in an accelerated fatigue tester and have been shown to behave satisfactorily after 300 million cycles. These additional crosslinks proved to be stable in saline at 37-degrees-C. Studies on bovine serum albumin attempted to get an insight into the mechanisms of lysine enhancement of glutaraldehyde crosslinking by treating sequentially albumin with glutaraldehyde and lysine and analysis of the products by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. These studies suggest that free amino groups exposed by proteins are initially reacted with glutaraldehyde and then bridged by the diamino compound (lysine) producing more extensive intermolecular crosslinking than glutaraldehyde alone.","ACAD MED SCI, MED RES CTR, CARDIOVASC SURG RES DEPT, POB 118-4300, Targu Mures, ROMANIA",,,,,,,,24,42,42,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

In this study different molecular weight PEO molecules were covalently attached to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films using cyanuric chloride chemistry. Prior to the PEO immobilization, amino groups were introduced onto the PET films by exposing them to an allylamine plasma glow discharge. The amino groups on the PET film were next activated with cyanuric chloride and then reacted with bis-amino PEO. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, water contact angle measurements, gravimetric analysis, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The adsorption of I-125-labeled baboon fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin was studied from buffer solutions. Gravimetric analysis indicated that the films grafted with the low-molecular-weight PEO contained many more PEO molecules than the surfaces grafted with higher-molecular-weight PEO. The high-molecular-weight PEO surfaces, however, exhibited greater wettability (lower water contact angles) and less protein adsorption than the low-molecular-weight PEO surfaces. Adsorption of albumin and fibrinogen to the PEO surfaces decreased with increasing PEO molecular weight up to 3500. A further increase in molecular weight resulted in only slight decreases in protein adsorption. Protein adsorption studies as a function of buffer ionic strength suggest that there may be an ionic interaction between the protein and the allylamine surface. The trends in protein adsorption together with the water contact angle results and the gravimetric analysis suggest that a kind of ""cooperative"" water structuring around the larger PEO molecules may create an ""excluded volume"" of the hydrated polymer coils. This may be an important factor contributing to the observed low protein adsorption behavior.","UNIV WASHINGTON, CTR BIOENGN, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,,,NCRR NIH HHS [RR01296],,,48,475,480,3,107,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Bacterial adhesion was generally reduced by the presence of protein during the adherence assay except in the case of bovine pericardium, in which adherence remained almost unaffected. The effect of these plasma proteins on bacterial surface properties resulted in strong increases of surface charge as measured by ion-exchange chromatography and with no effect on hydrophobicity, estimated as contact angles. Adherence was not found to be correlated with these two properties, suggesting that bacteria-surface interactions must not be simplified to the influence of interfacial forces.","FAC FARM SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,DEPT MICROBIOL & PARASITOL,E-15706 SANTIAGO,SPAIN",,,"Carballo, Julia/K-9953-2014","Carballo, Julia/0000-0003-4388-358X",,,,27,7,7,1,4,REV ESPANOLA FISIOLOGIA,PAMPLONA,"APARTADO 177, 31080 PAMPLONA, SPAIN",0034-9402,,,REV ESP FISIOL,Rev.

The hydrogel was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde using MgCl2 (water based) or toluenesulfonic acid (DMSO based) as the acid catalyst. The water-based gel was stiffer (compression modulus of 465 kPa) than the DMSO gel (compression modulus of 48.6 +/- 2.4 kPa). The terminal hydroxyl group of PEG (M(n) 2000 and 5000, with or without a monomethoxy end cap) was oxidized to an aldehyde by using an acetic anhydride-DMSO mixture or modified with a diisocyanatohexane to produce a terminal isocyanate. Optimum conversion to an aldehyde was realized at 8 h at room temperature, independent of molecular weight. Maximum conversion to the isocyanate occurred at 6 and 10 h/90-degrees-C for M(n) 2000 and 5000, respectively. Using the aldehyde-terminated PEG5000 in the presence of toluenesulfonic acid, XPS analysis of the immobilized product determined that an average maximum oxyethylene content of 71% was obtained after 4 h at 70-degrees-C. Both molecular weight species of poly(ethylene glycol isocyanate) were bound to PVA on the order of 74% oxyethylene content as measured by XPS. Covalent binding of PEG M(n) 5000 via an aldehyde had no effect on the advancing contact angle whereas immobilization through a urethane moiety resulted in a significant decrease, indicating that PEG dominated this surface in air. Since receding contact angles indicated total wetting of both modified and unmodified PVA surfaces, it was not possible to distinguish the presence of PEG from that of PVA on the surface of the gel in water. These surfaces are of potential interest as a means of reducing the thrombogenicity of cardiovascular biomaterials.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT CHEM ENGN & APPL CHEM, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA; UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA",,,,,,,,35,41,43,0,39,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,NOV 11,1991.0,24.0,23,,,,,6065,6072,,10.1021/ma00023a003,,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,GQ428,WOS:A1991GQ42800003,,,,,2019-02-25

In chambers made of pure titanium, the number of leucocytes increased about twofold from 1.8 x 10(6)/ml to 4.1 x 10(6)/ml between 24 h and 6 d, whereas a larger increase from 2.1 x 10(6)/ml to 8.3 x 10(6)/ml was observed in the polytetrafluorethylene chambers. Irrespective of implant material, polymorphonuclear granulocytes constituted the vast majority of leucocytes (> 81%). After 24 h the leukotriene B4 content was slightly higher in polytetrafluorethylene chambers than in titanium chambers. In contrast to the titanium chambers, a marked increase in leukotriene B4 levels was detected in polytetrafluorethylene chambers 6 d after insertion, whereas the greatest amount of leukotriene B4 in titanium chambers was measured at 9 d. Interleukin 1 was only detected in both types of chambers after 6 d. The present study, together with previous findings, shows that the materials used in this study elicit different degrees of inflammatory reactions in the chamber exudate. Since the number of leucocytes in the exudate retrieved from the chambers correlated well with the leukotriene B4 levels, it is suggested that leukotriene B4, but not interleukin 1, may be an important mediator for polymorphonuclear granulocyte migration into the implant-tissue interface. The role of leukotriene B4 and interleukin 1 for other parts of the inflammatory process around biomaterials in soft tissue, such as cell adhesion and activation and microvascular changes and their potential roles for the development of the peri-implant tissue remains to be established.","GOTHENBURG UNIV,DEPT ANAT,POB 33031,S-40033 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN",,,,"Thomsen, Peter/0000-0003-3910-6665",,,,21,19,19,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0142-9612,,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,NOV,1991.0,12.0,9,,,,,827,830,,10.1016/0142-9612(91)90069-M,,,,4,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,GT183,WOS:A1991GT18300006,1662545.0,,,,2019-02-25

Gas chromatography of the supernatant shows that substantial methanol is produced, along with trace amounts of N,N-dimethylethylene diamine. Thus, the primary mechanism underlying the structural changes appears to be hydrolysis of ester groups in the MMA side-chains, with a much smaller contribution due to amidolysis of the DMAA side-chains.

Adhesion of causative bacteria to biomaterials is considered to be an essential step in these infections. We and others have shown that adhesion of CoNS to biomaterials may be mediated by protease-sensitive surface constituents. In the present study we expanded on these investigations by characterizing a biomaterial adhesin of Staphylococcus epidermidis 354 by using a strain-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 36.4). MAb 36.4 was strongly and exclusively reactive with strain 354 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which whole bacteria were used as antigens. Immunoblotting of cell wall polypeptides of strain 354 revealed strong reactivity with a 200- to 220-kDa band and a weaker reaction in the 100- to 110-kDa range. Preincubation of strain 354 with MAb 36.4 resulted in a 54 to 91% (mean +/- standard deviation, 74% +/- 14%; n = 10) inhibition of adhesion to polystyrene spheres. Fab fragments prepared from MAb 36.4 also inhibited adhesion effectively, indicating specific blocking of an adhesion antigen rather than aspecific inhibition. Immunogold electron microscopy with MAb 36.4 revealed deposition of gold particles on the cell surface and possibly also on fimbrialike surface projections. It is concluded that a surface-located protein antigen of S. epidermidis 354 recognized by MAb 36.4 acts as an adhesin mediating attachment to uncoated foreign material. It is speculated that this type of adhesion to biomaterials may play an important role in the pathogenesis of foreign body-related infections caused by CoNS.","STATE UNIV UTRECHT,EIJKMAN WINKLER LAB MED MICROBIOL,HEIDELBERGLAAN 100,3584 CH UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; STATE UNIV UTRECHT,DEPT MOLEC CELL BIOL,UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; UNIV CHILDRENS HOSP HET WILHELMINA KINDERZIEKENHUIS,3512 LK UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; BRETONNEAU HOSP,DEPT INFECT DIS,F-37044 TOURS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,33,84,84,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

The customary approach to evaluating the role of this force, comparison of protein adsorption to a spectrum of solid surfaces spanning a range of hydrophobicities, is limited by incomplete control over surface chemical variables other than the overall hydrophobicity. We evaluate the importance of the hydrophobic interaction in protein adsorption, while maintaining constant surface properties, by addition of alcohols known to modulate the strength of the hydrophobic interaction in aqueous solutions. The responses of adsorption isotherms, dynamics, and lateral mobility of adsorbed proteins to changes in solvent composition demonstrate the primary role of the hydrophobic interaction in the adsorption of ribonuclease A to polystyrene surfaces.

These gels are highly swollen at low temperatures, gradually deswelling as temperature rises, usually sharply over a limited temperature range. Linear polymer type, crosslink density and ionic content have been varied in order to determine the effects of controllable network parameters on the important properties (degree of swelling, transition temperature and sharpness of transition) of the gels obtained. The transition temperature itself is about that of the observed linear polymer lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Producing gels from increasingly hydrophilic cellulose ethers raises the transition temperature and increases the swelling degree at comparable crosslink densities. However, decreasing crosslinking has little effect on swelling above the transition temperature. In contrast, increasing ionic content increases swelling at all temperatures. The transition temperature is not affected by the degree of crosslinking, but increases with increasing ionic content. The volume transition of the hydroxypropyl cellulose gel is significantly sharper than for the other gels. Crosslinking and ionic content have little effect on transition sharpness. The trends observed with cellulose ether gels are consistent with those observed in gels produced by conventional copolymerization/crosslinking synthesis methods, though some differences are noted.","UNIV CINCINNATI,DEPT CHEM ENGN,CINCINNATI,OH 45221",,,"Gehrke, Stevin/A-5265-2014",,,,,0,100,101,2,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-3659,,,J CONTROL RELEASE,J.

Additionally, conventional tensile adhesive bond strength testing was conducted. For the alumina-coated Ti-6Al-4V model system studied, an interface toughness value of 1.84 +/- 0.20 MPa m1/2 was obtained. An interfacial tensile bond strength of 13.6 +/- 2.9 MPa was also measured for this system. Further refinement of this modified short bar technique taking into account experimental compliance behaviour and potential complex or mixed-mode stress intensities is needed to confirm these preliminary toughness values, which nevertheless offer a potentially more sensitive means of monitoring the mechanical integrity of this metal/ceramic interface.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT MET & MAT SCI, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA","FILIAGGI, MJ (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO, CTR BIOMAT, TORONTO M5S 1A4, ONTARIO, CANADA.",,,"Filiaggi, Mark/0000-0003-4374-1733",,,,45,15,15,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

The biomaterials examined included PGA mesh, a composite mesh composed of a permanent nonabsorbable Novafil inner layer coated with a PGA outer layer, polyvinyl alcohol sponge, and silicon elastomer. Biomaterials were, removed at postoperative days 1, 2, 8, and 14, and examined for bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity by standard techniques. Mesh adherent leukocytes were evaluated for their ability to oxidize dichloro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), which is fluorescent in the presence of intracellular hydrogen peroxide produced by both polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes. PGA and the composite mesh had no intrinsic bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity. However, adherent leukocytes were induced to oxidize DCFH at levels 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively, by postoperative day 14, compared with earlier time points and other biomaterials.

Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory agent, acts on macrophages to decrease production of inflammatory mediators, and on mast cells to prevent degranulation. Systemic administration of dexamethasone (dms) in rats decreases the tissue reaction to intraperitoneally implanted vinyl chloride-acrylic copolymer capsules. Local release of even smaller amounts of dms from a polymeric substrate placed inside an acrylic copolymer capsule may control the tissue reaction while avoiding the undesirable side effects of systemic treatment. Such a system also allows investigation of the local effect of soluble molecules on tissue-material interactions without altering the surface properties of the implant or adding the effect of a releasing material. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dms released from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVAc) rods placed in acrylic copolymer capsules and implanted in the peritoneal cavity of rats. In vitro the release of dms from EVAc rods was quasilinear for 5 weeks. When implanted intraperitoneally into rats, polymer capsules containing EVAc/dms rods generated a tissue reaction that was significantly thinner and featured fewer fibroblast and collagen layers than that around capsules containing pure EVAc rods at all time points studied. The tissue reaction layer was also thinner than that previously described in rats treated systemically with dms. The trabeculae of implants with dms-loaded EVAc rods contained significantly more intact mast cells than implants with EVAc alone, suggesting that degranulation of mast cells is involved in the tissue reaction to intraperitoneal polymer implants.","BROWN UNIV,ARTIFICIAL ORGAN LAB,PROVIDENCE,RI 02912",,,"Aebischer, Patrick/E-1387-2013",,,,,26,18,18,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Degradation was observed for the four polymers studied under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The rate of degradation was affected by polymer side-chain structure and correlated with the swelling behavior. The ethyl side-chain polymers absorbed more water than their phenyl counterparts. Among the sterilization methods, UV irradiation followed by antibiotic treatment was the most suitable, as steam autoclave and ethylene oxide treatments altered the properties of several of the poly(phosphoesters). Tissue response to the poly(phosphoesters) in rabbits was characterized by minor encapsulation and slight or no lymphocyte, giant cell, or macrophage activity. No evidence of edema or necrosis was found. The elastic moduli of these materials varied from 488 MPa for poly(bisphenol A-ethylphosphate) (BPA/EOP) to 627 MPa for the more rigid poly(bisphenol A-phenylphosphonate) (BPA/PP). The ultimate strength, modulus, and energy to failure of BPA/PP were lower than those of similarly compression molded high-molecular-weight poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA).","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,BALTIMORE,MD 21218; JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV HOSP,DEPT COMPARAT MED,BALTIMORE,MD 21205",,,"Leong, Kam/A-7270-2009","Leong, Kam/0000-0002-8133-4955",,,,21,70,71,0,8,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Although both polymers are polydispersed (especially Dx) most theoretical treatments refer only to the average molecular weight (number or mass) and assume that the molecular weight distribution of each polymer is the same in both phases. In this work the molecular weight distributions of four stock solutions of PEG (4000, 6000, 10,000 and 20,000) and four stock solutions of Dx (10,000, 40,000, 110,000 and 500,000) were measured using High Performance Gel Chromatography. The measurements were repeated on the phases formed by the polymer solutions after they were mixed and allowed to equilibrate. The molecular weight distribution of the Dx differed in the top and bottom phase; both differed from that of the stock solution. Although we believe that the molecular weight distribution for PEG also differs in the top and bottom phases, we were unable to determine this within the resolution of our instruments.","HEINRICH HEINE UNIV DUSSELDORF,INST ENZYMTECHNOL,W-5170 JULICH,GERMANY",,,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [1 RO 1-GM40023-02],,,14,10,10,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1656,,,J BIOTECHNOL,J.

When partially cationized cellulose was used under suitable conditions for heparin enrichment and additionally four different crosslinking reagents and different reaction steps were applied and compared with non-cationized cellulose, the ionic fixation of heparin was ten to fifty times higher compared with non-cationized cellulose. When tested with blood partially cationized cellulose showed a high platelet adhesion whereas endothelial-cell-surface-heparansulfate (ES-HS), isolated from bovine aorta and immobilized on partially cationized cellulose, was completely inert to platelet adhesion measured in a modified Baumgartner chamber. The latter result seems to give a new promising concept for the synthesis of biomaterials, e.g. membranes with nonthrombogenic surfaces similar to surfaces of blood vessels in nature because the isolation procedure of ES-HS and immobilization of ES-HS on polymer surfaces does not change the inertness of ES-HS to platelet adhesion.","RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, CHEM & PATHOBIOCHEM KLIN, W-5100 AACHEN, GERMANY","BAUMANN, H (reprint author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, WORRINGERWEG 1, W-5100 AACHEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,42,13,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Direct quantitative methods utilise either measurements of the physical characteristics of the coated surface (equipment necessary for this is not always available), or measurements of radiolabelled protein. We demonstrate that proteins labelled with I-125 using chloramine-T contain a significant proportion of I-125 label which is unable to adsorb to polyvinyl microtitre wells. This non-bindable label is not separable from protein by fractionation on Sephadex G-25 but does dissociate upon SDS gel electrophoresis. The proportion of non-adsorbable label increases with storage time at -70-degrees-C, the effect being accelerated at higher temperatures. A method is described for estimating protein adsorption which is both independent of the non adsorbable fraction but can also be used to estimate it. The use of biotin as a protein label does not apparently result in deterioration of adsorption with short storage times.

Two fluorescent dyes of particular value for vital fluorescence studies are Rhodamine-123 and 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL). We examined the toxicity of these two dyes and of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent used in Rhodamine-123 studies, on the growth of MRC5 human fetal fibroblasts in monolayer culture. Two parameters of cell growth were quantitated: Cell number (a measure of proliferation), and cell area (a measure of cell spreading), based on microscopic images obtained at the start and end of a 48-h growth period after brief exposure (0.5 h) to test solutions. We found that the recommended solvent for solubilization of Rhodamine-123, DMSO, caused cessation of cell proliferation and actual reduction in the area covered by adherent fibroblasts at concentrations of as low as 0.1% (vol:vol). Rhodamine-123 made up from an aqueous stock solution modestly retarded proliferation and spreading, and there was no significant effect of DiI-LDL on these parameters over prolonged periods of exposure (up to 24 h) in culture. These results demonstrate that the most toxic substance for growing fibroblasts was the solvent DMSO. We conclude that both the solvent vehicle and fluorescent dye should be carefully examined for potential toxicity before such dyes are used for vital fluorescence studies of living cells.","BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT PATHOL,75 FRANCIS ST,BOSTON,MA 02115; BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT SURG,BOSTON,MA 02115",,,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [DK-39512]; NCRR NIH HHS [BRSG 807 RR05950],,,31,17,17,0,2,SOC IN VITRO BIOLOGY,COLUMBIA,"8815 CENTRE PARK DRIVE SUITE 210, COLUMBIA, MD 21045",0073-5655,,,IN VITRO CELL DEV B,,AUG,1991.0,27.0,8,,,,,633,638,,,,,,6,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,GG585,WOS:A1991GG58500008,1917780.0,,,,2019-02-25

The accuracy of stress and strain field measurements has been assessed by finite element analysis of a biaxially-loaded isotropic elastic membrane.

Other prostheses composed of tissue-derived and polymeric biomaterials also are complicated by deposition of mineral. We have previously demonstrated that: (a) Failure due to calcification of clinical bioprosthetic valves can be simulated by either a large animal circulatory model or subdermal implants in rodents. (b) Calcification of bioprosthetic tissue has complex host, implant, and mechanical determinants. (c) The initial calcification event in the rat subdermal model is the mineral deposition in devitalized cells intrinsic to the bioprosthetic tissue within 48 to 72 h, followed later by collagen mineralization. (d) Initiation of bioprosthetic tissue mineralization, like that of physiological bone formation, has ""matrix vesicles"" as early nucleation sites. (e) Alkaline phosphatase (AP), an enzyme also associated with matrix vesicles involved in bone mineral nucleation, is present in both fresh and fixed bioprosthetic tissue at sites of initial mineralization. (f) Certain inhibitors of bioprosthetic tissue calcification (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+) are localized to the sites at which alkaline phosphatase is present. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that alkaline phosphatase is a key element in the pathogenesis of mineralization of bioprosthetic tissue. In the present studies, we focused on the relationship of AP to early events in calcification, and the inhibition of both calcification and AP activity by FeCl3 and AlCl3 preincubations. Subdermal implants of glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium (GPBP) were done in 3-week-old rats. AP was characterized by enzymatic hydrolysis of paranitrophenyl phosphate (pnpp), and by histochemical studies. Calcification was evaluated chemically (by atomic adsorption spectroscopy) and morphologically (by light microscopy). The results of these studies are as follows: (a) Extractable AP activity is present in fresh but not glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardial tissue. However, histochemical studies reveal active AP within the intrinsic devitalized cells of GPBP, despite extended glutaraldehyde incubation. (b) Extrinsic AP is rapidly adsorbed following implantation, with peak activity at 72 h (424 +/- 67.2 nm pnpp/mg protein/ min enzyme activity [units]), but markedly lesser amounts at 21 days (96.8 +/- 3.9 units). (c) Simultaneously to the AP activity maximum, bulk calcification is initiated, with GPBP calcium levels rising from 1.2 +/- 0.1 (unimplanted) to 2.4 +/-0.2-mu-g/mg at 72 h, to 55.6 +/- 3.1-mu-g/mg at 21 days, despite a marked decline in AP activity at this later time. (d) Preincubation of GPBP in either FeCl3 or AlCl3, at concentrations (0.1 M) which inhibited GPBP calcification, significantly reduce AP activity. We conclude that endogenous AP activity is present but not extractable in unimplanted GPBP fixed for extended periods. However, concurrent with the time of the onset of GPBP calcification in the rat subdermal model, AP adsorbed following implantation rises sharply to a maximum, thereby augmenting intrinsic enzyme. Preincubations of GPBP in either AlCl3 or FeCl3 not only prevent calcification, but also result in reduction in AP activity. These results strongly suggest that AP is an important cofactor in the mechanism of bioprosthetic valve mineralization and may be a fruitful target for anticalcification treatments.","BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP,DEPT PATHOL,BOSTON,MA 02115; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115","LEVY, RJ (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT PEDIAT,R5014 KRESGE IT 0576,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",,,,,,,83,67,71,0,5,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

Once established, biomaterial-mediated infections are resistant to treatment and persist until the device is removed. The objective of this work was to study the prevention of bacterial-biofilm formation on polymeric implant (polyurethane) by controlled release of incorporated antibacterial agents (parabens). By embedding parabens in PU by the solvent-cast method, matrices with amorphous dispersions (or solid solutions) were obtained. Release rate modulation was achieved by using different MW parabens and by a rate-limiting membrane. Preliminary in vitro antibacterial studies of both methyl and propyl paraben matrices exhibited significant inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation. Propyl paraben matrices (15 and 20% w/w drug load) decreased the number of colony-forming units on PU surface to 2 x 10(4)/mL, in comparison to 6 x 10(5) on control polymers. This significant reduction was obtained without any effect on the number of viable bacteria in the suspension culture.

For the system poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-dextran-water these novel physical pictures are based on the observation that a transition occurs in the nature of the top PEO-rich phase, from the dilute to the semidilute polymer solution regimes, with increasing PEO molecular weight. In systems containing low molecular weight PEO (M < 10 000 Da), individual polymer coils, which may be larger or smaller than the proteins, interact with the proteins. Mathematically simple geometric and scaling arguments are used to probe the qualitative form of the free-energy change arising from polymer-protein and polymer-polymer interactions within each picture. Through a statistical thermodynamic framework, used to relate the change in free energy to the experimentally measurable protein partition coefficient, K(p), it is possible to discriminate between the novel physical pictures on the basis of the predicted qualitative trends. At THETA-solvent conditions for the polymer, a picture that incorporates solely the excluded-volume interactions between the proteins and the polymer coils is unable to account for the influence of polymer molecular weight on K(p); at athermal-solvent conditions, where repulsive polymer-polymer interactions also influence the protein chemical potential, the predicted protein partition coefficient is shifted in a direction qualitatively consistent with experimental trends. For both athermal- and THETA-solvent conditions, the observed change in K(p) is found to be qualitatively consistent with the presence of a weak attraction between the polymer coils and the proteins. The presence of a strong attraction between the polymer coils and the proteins, and associated formation of an adsorbed polymer layer at the surface of the proteins, can lead to a new partitioning behavior that has not yet been realized experimentally. In systems containing high molecular weight PEO (M >> 10 000 Da), the proteins interact with an entangled polymer network rather than with identifiable polymer coils, and the protein partition coefficient becomes independent of the PEO molecular weight.","MIT, DEPT CHEM ENGN, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,,,,,,,73,84,86,1,21,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JUL 22,1991.0,24.0,15,,,,,4334,4348,,10.1021/ma00015a015,,,,15,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FY047,WOS:A1991FY04700015,,,,,2019-02-25

Liquid culture systems may detect cytotoxicity of a material either by culture of cells with extracts or with the material itself. In the latter instance, renewing the medium will remove possible released cytotoxic products. The agar-overlay test is a short term semi-solid culture system in which the possible cytotoxicity of biomaterials is identified only by the presence of cell free zones. The aim of this study was to develop a more sensitive cytotoxicity test system for biomaterials, using methylcellulose as a culture gel, mixed with human fibroblasts. The main advantage of the test system is the possibility of evaluating cytotoxicity for a period of up to seven days without renewal of the culture gel. Furthermore it is possible to both quantitatively evaluate by counting absolute cell numbers and to qualitatively evaluate by studying cell morphology with light- and/or electron microscopy. Processed dermal sheep collagen was selected as test material, since contradictory results concerning the cytotoxicity of its extracts have been reported by others [2, 15, 18, 19]. Using our test system, both primary and secondary cytotoxic effects were found. Primary cytotoxicity is due to direct leakage of products from the material, detected by testing, extracts of the collagen or the collagen itself. Secondary cytotoxicity is due to release of cytotoxic products resulting from cell-biomaterial interactions.

Dacron or polyglactin 910 were added to two of three conditions of both cell groups in passage 2. Conditioned media were collected weekly through week 15. Mitogenicity assays were performed with quiescent mouse embryonal (BALB/c3T3) fibroblasts, atherosclerotic rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells, and murine capillary lung (LE-II) endothelial cells. Mitogenic activity was assayed by scintillation counting of tritiated thymidine incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Results showed increased mitogenic activity released by macrophages from atherosclerotic rabbits, in the absence of prosthetic material, when assayed against every cell line. In normal diet macrophages, polyglactin 910 stimulated mitogen release for every cell line, and Dacron yielded minimal mitogen release. In lipid diet macrophages polyglactin 910 slightly increased mitogen release for all three cell lines, whereas Dacron resulted in stimulation of DNA synthesis in smooth muscle cells and BALB/c3T3 cells but less DNA synthesis in LE-II cells than in control, no graft material, media. Western blotting demonstrated immunoreactivity to basic fibroblast growth factor in media from normal diet macrophages but only in the presence of polyglactin 910 or Dacron. Radioimmunoassay for platelet-derived growth factor B chain was negative in all groups, and polymerase chain reaction techniques to amplify transforming growth factor-beta messenger ribonucleic was negative. These data demonstrate the effect of in vivo dietary manipulation on macrophage activation as well as the effect of an atherogenic diet in modulating macrophage/biomaterial interactions.

Latex gloves, which were in general use only at the time of the last survey, seemed to have prevented some dermatoses formerly attributed to handwashing procedures. However, latex gloves per se had also induced dermatoses. Non-dermatological ailments of a transient nature comprised eye, respiratory, or systemic reactions and were connected with volatiles from X-ray liquids, methylmethacrylate monomer, and disinfectants. Adverse patient reactions occurred at a frequency of about one per 2600 treated patients. The observations comprised skin reactions (head/face), gingival/mucosal ulcerations, and sometimes systemic/urticarial reactions. The reactions were associated with the use of local anesthetics, orthodontic appliances, and other biomaterials. Two reactions were related to contact with the dentists' latex gloves.","OSLO PUBL DENT HLTH SERV,OSLO,NORWAY","JACOBSEN, N (reprint author), SCANDINAVIAN INST DENT MAT,NIOM,N-1344 HASLUM,NORWAY.",,,,,,,25,44,44,1,1,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0301-5661,,,COMMUNITY DENT ORAL,Community Dentist.

Beginning as a research thrust, which led to courses at a few universities, biomaterials education has evolved into distinct curriculum in over 60 institutions in the United States and Canada alone. Rapid growth, however, can cause problems. In an effort to determine the present status and future needs in each sector, as well as begin to assess if the needs of industry are being met by present academic programs, two surveys were sent out. As shown by the two surveys, academic programs have been increasing in both size and quality while industry has also been expanding, as indicated by the many small companies involved in biomaterials. The shift toward graduate programs is in keeping with the perceived educational needs of potential employers. The majority of academic programs appear to be providing the training and coursework desired by employers. Further information, however, is needed to determine if the number of graduates trained in biomaterials is adequate, or in fact excessive. It is, therefore, recommended that a more comprehensive survey, sent to the biomaterials companies listed in the FDA registry, be undertaken. In addition, a survey to each academic program that addresses hiring of recent graduates would also be beneficial. It does appear that certain standards for curricula could be agreed upon, although the field has probably not evolved sufficiently for accreditation or professional registration to be addressed yet.","ONCOGEN,SEATTLE,WA","FELDMAN, DS (reprint author), UNIV ALABAMA,SCH ENGN,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,BUSINESS ENGN COMPLEX,ROOM 256,UAB STN,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35294, USA.",,,,,,,4,3,3,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",1045-4861,,,J APPL BIOMATER,J.

Radiolabelled bacteria (10(8) cfu/ml) were incubated in vials containing 1-cm lengths of catheter for up to 3 days. The peak of maximal adherence to each biomaterial was reached after 24 h for P. aeruginosa and after 72 h for the other strains. Bacterial adherence to PVC and siliconised latex was significantly higher (2-6 times; p < 0.05) than to the other biomaterials for all the strains. The lowest values of adherence were observed with polyurethane and Vialon(R) for the staphylococci but with Teflon(R) for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. None of the eluates affected the viability of the staphylococci. However, all of them, significantly increased the growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa with the exception of the eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced to an undetectable level for E. coli. We conclude that bacterial adherence to catheters may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that certain substances eluted from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different micro-organisms.","UNIV SEVILLE,SCH MED,DEPT MICROBIOL,APDO 914,E-41080 SEVILLE,SPAIN",,,"Pascual, Alvaro/Y-5854-2018","Pascual, Alvaro/0000-0002-8672-5891",,,,13,55,57,0,1,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0022-2615,,,J MED MICROBIOL,J.

The PU-FBNG material was processed through a spraying, phase-inversion technique to fabricate porous tubular conduits. FBNG was subsequently converted into covalently cross-linked fibrin (FBN) through the action of thrombin (Th), fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF), and calcium ions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the cross-linked blend was more stable than native cross-linked FBN. Tensile behaviors of the PU-FBN materials closely matched those of a natural artery on varying the ratio PU/FBN. Implantation experiments in the rat model showed a mature internal capsule and good tissue organization of PU-FBN (50%) grafts in the regenerated arterial wall. However, 50% of FBN did not assure adequate mechanical resistance, and aneurysmal changes were seen in some grafts. DSC of CLG-based materials, processed by casting, showed that the synthetic component offered definite advantage compared to the CLG denaturation temperature, particularly noticeable for CLG-PAA and CLG-PVAL blends. Material advantages and drawbacks are discussed.","CNR,IST FISIOL CLIN,I-56100 PISA,ITALY; SCUOLA NORMALE SUPER PISA,ENI,I-56100 PISA,ITALY",,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,2,WICHTIG EDITORE,MILAN,"72/74 VIA FRIULI, 20135 MILAN, ITALY",0391-3988,,,INT J ARTIF ORGANS,Int.

Many of these complications are caused by the intrinsic thrombogenicity of the biomaterials, which are used to cast the luminal blood sac. Numerous attempts have been made to improve the hemocompatibility of the new generation of totally implantable blood pumps, mainly by physico-chemical modifications of the biopolymeric materials and the blood contacting surfaces. We, on the other hand, believe that the most promising and challenging approach, from both the biologists' and engineers' point of view, is to coat the luminal surfaces of cardiac prostheses with a functional monolayer of autologous endothelial cells (ECs) and thus reproduce ""nature's biocompatible blood container."" The key to lining an artificial heart with a nonthrombogenic monolayer of endothelial cells is to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms which render the EC lining inside the beating ventricle nonthrombogenic and resistant to flow-induced shear stresses and cyclic, tensional deformations. This knowledge has then to be translated into biotechnological know-how, in order to maintain an intact EC monolayer inside the blood sac of an artificial device. In this paper we emphasize some of the bioengineering issues associated with the endothelialization of the luminal sac, and also discuss some aspects related to the blood sac itself.","UNIV WISCONSIN, SCH MED, DEPT MED, CELL BIOL LAB, MILWAUKEE, WI 53201 USA",,,,,,,,93,9,9,0,1,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

Upon heating to about 300-350-degrees-C, 7 spontaneously rearranged to poly(Bisphenol A N-phenylurethane) (4). The rearrangement was a first-order reaction with an activation energy of 180 kJ/mol. The transformation of 7 to 4 was followed by FT-IR. Analysis of the polymer before and after heat treatment by gel permeation chromatography and low-angle laser light scattering indicated that the rearrangement proceeded without detectable backbone cleavage. The chemical structure of 4 was confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR. This polymer formed transparent, amorphous, and mechanically strong films (tensile strength, 567 kg/cm2; tensile modulus, 23,800 kg/cm2; elongation at break, 5.5%). Contrary to unsubstituted polyurethanes, 4 was thermally very stable. The onset of the decomposition exotherm was observed at 475-degrees-C (DSC, in air, open pan), and the polymer started to lose weight at 504-degrees-C (TGA, in air). Since N-substituted polyurethanes cannot be readily obtained by conventional polymerization reactions, the exceptionally clean, thermal rearrangement of 7 to 4 represents a rare case of a synthetically useful, polymeric backbone rearrangement.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903",,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0024-9297,,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,APR 29,1991.0,24.0,9,,,,,2302,2308,,10.1021/ma00009a028,,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FJ881,WOS:A1991FJ88100028,,,,,2019-02-25

The integrated Py-FI mass spectra give characteristic fingerprints of the biomaterials investigated. The application of principal component analysis to the mass spectral data results in a clear discrimination and classification of the samples reflecting the chemical modifications and transformations of organic matter by biochemical and biogeochemical processes. The chemical compositions are determined by processes such as enrichment and/or translocation of plant constituents (e.g. carbohydrates, lignin, lipids, suberin, and aliphatic polymers) during maturation and senescence of needles; amendment of new components; decomposition; selective preservation and humification processes in the soil environment. During needle maturation, major chemical changes include the decrease of carbohydrate content, condensation of lignin, and crosslinking of waves. Senescent needles are characterized by lower contents of carbohydrates and lower yields of monomeric pyrolysis products from lignin. The contribution of different litter materials to the humus layer can be estimated by differences in chemical composition. During litter decomposition and humification on the forest floor, carbohydrate content decreases rapidly. The lignin content remains almost constant but some subunits are continuously oxidized.

To test an existing model for its usefulness in quantitative evaluation of periodontal wound healing, large supraalveolar periodontal defects were surgically created around the mandibular premolars (P2, P3, P4) in the left or right jaw quadrants in 5 beagle dogs. The defects were exposed to the oral environment for 6 months and were then subjected to reconstructive flap surgery (chronic defects). Healing in these defects was compared to healing following reconstructive surgery in similar contralateral defects which had not been exposed to plaque and calculus (acute defects). The animals were sacrificed after a 4-week healing period and tissue blocks including teeth and surrounding structures were processed for histometric analysis. Mean defect height (+/- s.d) for chronic and acute defects amounted to 4.6 +/- 0.3 and 4.4 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. Mean connective tissue repair to the root surface in chronic defects amounted to 62% (range 49% to 74%) of the defect height. Mean connective tissue repair in the acute defects exceeded 94% of the defect height in 4 of the dogs, but amounted to only 48% in 1 dog. Regeneration of alveolar bone and cementum was limited under both experimental conditions. Root resorption was frequently encountered, whereas ankylosis was seen in only few teeth. This study indicates that healing may vary not only as a result of controlled experimental variables, but also due to differences in biological response between dogs or to fortuitous traumatic factors. The variability in healing in the chronic defects imposes limitations on the use of this defect model to study periodontal regeneration, especially when a small number of animals is used.","NATL DENTAL HLTH SERV, KRISTIANSTAD, SWEDEN; UNIV BERGEN, N-5014 BERGEN, NORWAY","WIKESJO, UME (reprint author), LOMA LINDA UNIV, SCH DENT, LOMA LINDA, CA 92350 USA.",,"Wikesjo, Ulf/A-4159-2009","Wikesjo, Ulf/0000-0003-1607-0583",,,,38,35,35,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-3492,1943-3670,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

To investigate the growth characteristics of endothelial cells on theoretically suitable biomaterials, we compared three polyurethanes (Pellethane, Biomer, Enka) and three silicone rubbers (Elastosil, 3145 RTV, Medical Adhesive). All synthetic surfaces were precoated with an extracellular matrix (group 1), fibronectin (group 2), or a glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix (group 3). After the seeding of 2.5 X 10(4)/cm2 human endothelial cells onto the various surfaces, primary adherence, growth kinetics, and maintenance of monolayer integrity were studied for 13 days. On the three polyurethanes all precoating procedures resulted in endothelial cell proliferation and the formation of persistent monolayers. In contrast, on silicone rubbers a persistent coverage with a confluent endothelium could be achieved only on the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix. When endothelial cell growth was quantitatively assessed on all precoating substrates, the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix proved to be far superior on each of the synthetics (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of endothelialization of artificial hearts in vitro. Provided such an endothelium can withstand the mechanical forces within an artificial heart, in vitro endothelialization might contribute to a regained attractiveness of the elective long-term implantation of artificial hearts.","UNIV VIENNA,DEPT SURG 2,A-1010 VIENNA,AUSTRIA; UNIV FREIBURG,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,W-7800 FREIBURG,GERMANY; UNIV CAPE TOWN,DEPT CARDIOVASC SURG,CAPE TOWN,SOUTH AFRICA",,,,,,,,28,11,11,0,1,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0022-5223,,,J THORAC CARDIOV SUR,J.

To understand this, a computer simulation of stress in a PFM strip was conducted. The simulation considers cooling from temperatures higher than the porcelain sag point. The following temperature-dependent factors were incorporated : the elastic modulus, shear viscosity (porcelain), and coefficient of thermal expansion. Cooling rates during tempering of porcelain were measured. The cooling rate dependencies of the glass transition temperature and temperature distribution during cooling were also included in the simulation. The results suggest that tempering with a high cooling rate make up for compressive residual stress in body porcelain and the high curvature of the composite beam.",,"ASAOKA, K (reprint author), UNIV TOKUSHIMA,SCH DENT,3-18-15 KURAMOTO CHO,TOKUSHIMA 770,JAPAN.",,,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS SANSHIN HOKUSEI BLDG,TOKYO,"4-9 YOYOGI 2-CHOME SHIBUYA-KU, TOKYO 151, JAPAN",0914-8809,,,JSME INT J I-SOLID M,,APR,1991.0,34.0,2,,,,,156,162,,10.1299/jsmea1988.34.2_156,,,,7,"Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,FP412,WOS:A1991FP41200007,,Bronze,,,2019-02-25

According to this criterion, biomaterials such as hemodialysis membranes made from cellulosic or various synthetic polymers were classified as activators or nonactivators of complement. Since certain membranes bind large quantities of C3a from the fluid phase, classification based on fluid-phase C3a concentration has in some instances been inaccurate. As follows from the comparison of complement activation by cuprophane and polyacrylonitrile membranes, the capacity of a biomedical polymer to activate complement is not determined by the number of potential covalent binding sites on its surface. Biomaterial itself may lack hydroxyl and/or amino groups, and yet it may activate C3 in human serum very efficiently. Some of the biomaterials may also bind unactivated/unfragmented C3 whether in the absence or presence of other serum proteins. In addition, binding of factor B (a promotor of C3 activation) and binding of factor H (an inhibitor of C3 activation) to certain biomaterials have been found to be independent of complement activation and unaffected by the presence or absence of C3. Thus, it is becoming apparent that the requirements for the formation and stability of the C3 convertase on artificial surfaces differ from those on biological membranes, and that the relative magnitude of binding of factor B and factor H to the surface per se cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the capacity of the biomaterial to activate complement. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of C3 and C5 activation on the surfaces of biomedical polymers. Its understanding should lead to the development of new or modification of existing artificial membranes which would cause less adverse effects for patients during extracorporeal procedures.",,"JANATOVA, J (reprint author), UNIV UTAH,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL,50 N MED DR,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84132, USA.",,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [DK 35830]; NIAID NIH HHS [AI 19319],,,0,56,56,0,6,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1012-8204,,,COMPLEMENT INFLAMMAT,,MAR-APR,1991.0,8.0,2,,,,,61,69,,10.1159/000463181,,,,9,Immunology,Immunology,FF582,WOS:A1991FF58200001,2055009.0,,,,2019-02-25

Exposure of Vitagraft ePTFE to a vacuum prior to saline immersion replaced 87.5% of the gas nuclei with saline (denucleation). Acetone and ethanol immersion produced 98.9% and 94.3% denucleation, respectively. Denucleation was essentially complete when vacuum exposure was followed by hydrostatic pressure treatment at 500 psig or greater. The influence of gas content on thrombogenicity was determined by immersing graft samples in whole canine blood and weighing the adherent thrombus. Denucleation significantly reduced adherent thrombus weight compared with control grafts (p < 0.001). Air in Vitagraft walls was responsible for 84% of the adherent thrombus weight at four minutes.

However, when extracts of synthesized poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) specimens, differentially treated after polymerization, were subjected to the same assays it was found that toxicity from residual 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate monomer was lost during steam sterilization and storage in water because of the removal of the monomer through aqueous washing.

Vein replacements are the most vulnerable to thrombosis because of their low shear rates and low pressure. Experimental replacement of microvenous segments with prosthetic segments has shown little success. Recent technological advances in biomaterials and control of thrombogenesis provide the potential for success in the development of venous prostheses. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of nonbiodegradable composite polyurethane microvascular prostheses for reconstruction of rat femoral veins. Rat femoral venous defects of 10 mm were reconstructed with autogenous vein (n = 12), unprocessed plain polyurethane (n = 5), and nonbiodegradable composite polyurethane (n = 31). Patency was evaluated by direct observation and proximal venous milking tests. The patency rate of composite grafts was not significantly different from that of isotopic vein (p = 0.5, Fisher's exact test), and both had higher patency than unprocessed polyurethane (p < 0.01). Composite grafts were examined sequentially using light and scanning electron microscopy. Grafts were fully endothelialized between the first and third months. The neointimal, neomedial, and neoadventitial layers could be seen more distinctly over time.

Heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents were used to derivatize rHir and form covalent crosslinks between rHir and albumin producing active conjugates. Both derivatized rHir and conjugates inhibited human alpha-thrombin similarly, however, both showed a ten-fold decrease of alpha-thrombin inhibition when compared to rHir alone using the tripeptide substrate, S-2238. Immobilization of 2.75 +/- 0.45-mu-g rHir on 1.0 cm2 Dacron prosthetic graft patches resulted in inhibition of 1.88 +/- 0.03-mu-g alpha-thrombin in solution (mean +/- SD, n = 3), which is a 8:1 molar ratio, respectively. rHir ED50 inhibition of 0.1 NIH U alpha thrombin stimulated whole blood platelet aggregation was 0.12 x 10(-6)-mu-M. The conjugate ED50 inhibition was 1.37 x 10(-6)-mu-M showing an eleven-fold loss of activity.

This approach was used to provide substrates that were adhesive to cells even in the absence of serum proteins and with no prior pretreatment of the surface with proteins of the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) family. This approach was used to dramatically enhance the cell-adhesiveness of substrates that were otherwise cell-nonadhesive and to improve control of cellular interactions with cell-adhesive materials by providing stably bound adhesion ligands. Glycophase glass was examined as a model cell-nonadhesive substrate prior to modification, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were examined as representative materials for biomedical applications. The peptides were surface-coupled by their N-terminal amine to surface hydroxyl moieties using tresyl chloride chemistry. Prior to peptide grafting, the PET and PTFE were surface hydroxylated to yield PETOH and PTFE-OH. The PET-OH was less cell-adhesive and the PTFE-OH was much more cell-adhesive than the native polymers. Radioiodination of a C-terminal tyrosine residue was used to quantify the amount of peptide coupled to the surface, and these amounts were 12.1 pmol/cm2 on glycophase glass, 139 fmol/cm2 on PETOH, and 31 fmol/cm2 on PTFE-OH. Although the glycophase glass did not support adhesion or spreading even in the presence of serum, the RGD- and YIGSR-grafted glycophase glass did support adhesion and spreading, even when the only serum protein that was included was albumin. Although PET and PTFE-OH supported adhesion when incubated in serum-supplemented medium, neither of these materials supported adhesion with only albumin present, indicating that cell adhesion is mediated by adsorbed CAM proteins. When these materials were peptide-grafted, however, extensive adhesion and spreading did occur even when only albumin was present. Since the peptide grafting is quite easily controlled and is temporally stable, while protein adsorption is quite difficult to precisely control and is temporally dynamic, peptide grafting may be advantageous over other approaches employed to improve long-term cell adhesion to biomaterials.","UNIV TEXAS,DEPT CHEM ENGN,AUSTIN,TX 78712",,,"Hubbell, Jeffrey/A-9266-2008","Hubbell, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0276-5456",,,,26,234,239,0,44,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NEW YORK,"605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0021-9304,,,J BIOMED MATER RES,J.

In this chapter, a constitutive model, for a basic composite element under finite deformation, has been explored. The derivation is based upon the approaches of finite elasticity and a strain-energy function in terms of the Lagrangian strains referring to the initial principal material axes. Both fibre geometric nonlinearity and matrix material nonlinearity have been taken into account. Also, based upon this model, the tensile behavior of flexible composites containing two different types of fiber geometric forms are presented: wavy fibers and straight fiber network (laminates). These theoretical models may be used to analyze the nonlinear finite deformation behavior of textile fabric reinforced flexible composites as well as the biomaterials.",,"LUO, SY (reprint author), UNIV NEVADA, DEPT MECH ENGN, RENO, NV 89557 USA.",,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

RAMSES allows basic and applied research on free flow zone electrophoresis, in order to assess the influence of a low-gravity environment on the purification of biological products. Experiments will be performed by European and American scientists. The facility will be integrated in a Spacelab single rack. Using in situ diagnostics with a U.V. photometer and a cross illuminator, RAMSES investigates a wide variety of transport phenomena to better understand the basic mechanisms which govern electrophoresis method. RAMSES should be a basis for a more complete facility dedicated to the purification of biomaterials, associating various separation methods.

Cell adhesion and deposition of chemicals such as calcium, lipoproteins and mucin on the lens surface cause visual acuity which is the main problem in extended uses of contact occular lenses. In order to minimise the cell adhesion and other type of depositions, a method of surface modification of lens involving the use of phosphoryl choline, a phospholipid and the glow discharge technique has been described. The power variation of the lenses after modification has been checked using Topcon lensometer. The possible power changes of the modified samples due to the exposure to the normal light in the laboratory, darkness, ultraviolet (U.V.) light or saline have been investigated by taking the visible and ultra violet spectra using Beckman spectrophotometer. Surface energy variations after modifications of the samples have been checked by sessile drop water contact angle measurements. Glow discharge treatment increases the hydrophilicity of the samples. It seems, the modifications do not affect the power of hard contact lens significantly. It is also observed that the exposure of samples to the normal light in the laboratory, darkness, U.V. light or saline make no significant change in the visible and ultraviolet spectra of the samples before and after modification.","SREE CHITRA TIRUNAL INST MED SCI & TECHNOL,DIV BIOSURFACE TECHNOL,BIOMED TECHNOL WING,TRIVANDRUM 695012,INDIA",,,"Sharma, Chandra/A-4140-2009","Sharma, Chandra/0000-0002-6982-0926",,,,15,5,5,1,5,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",1055-7172,,,BIOMAT ARTIF CELL IM,Biomater.

The preparations were examined by scanning or transmission electron microscopy. The surface of dry collagen fibers cut at room temperature appeared compressed. Observations of the internal substructure were distorted. The open face of the fibers were frequently covered with debris. Conversely, when fibers were frozen and then fractured, dehydrated fibers appeared to have undistorted features and were intact around their edges. No contamination across the face of the fiber was apparent and there was no difference in morphology between the nitrogen and Freon frozen dehydrated collagen fibers. Transmission electron microscopy showed that collagen fibers were composed of a subpopulation of transverse and longitudinal collagen fibrils and fibril bundles embedded in a disorganized amorphous collagen matrix. Freeze fracturing or snapping collagenous biomaterials was shown to be an effective method for retaining the substructure of these dry and very fragile materials.

We have identified proteins expressed on the surfaces of retrieved vascular grafts to determine if certain proteins were present at the end stage of vascular failure. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of protein adsorption on the surfaces of retrieved vascular prostheses was determined using antibodies to human blood proteins fibrinogen, fibronectin, Hageman factor (factor XII and factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor. The detection of these proteins on the blood contacting surface was evaluated by immunogold labelling with protein A-gold beads followed by silver enhancement. Fibronectin was the most abundant protein detected on retrieved expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or umbilical vein grafts. Protein adsorption was disperse for all proteins and one protein, fibronectin, was found in great amounts on all surfaces. Proteins such as fibronectin may be important in the adhesion and activation of platelets and leukocytes and thus contribute to the development of thrombosis. These analyses of human vascular grafts indicate that surface proteins can be readily detected by our methods and thus may be useful in determination of specific proteins important in the thrombogenicity and/or biocompatibility of cardiovascular devices.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL,DEPT PATHOL,2085 ADELBERT RD,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,CLEVELAND,OH 44106; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT MACROMOLEC SCI,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",,,,,,,,39,20,20,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,1,,,,,73,82,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK711,WOS:A1991GK71100009,,,,,2019-02-25

The application of these procedures resulted in a versatile, low toxicity GMA embedding medium. GMA embedding medium and resin blocks were tested utilizing a variety of physico-chemical techniques, namely: gas chromatography, determination of the maximum temperature reached during polymerization, the time taken to reach the maximum temperature, hardness testing, determination of the glass transition temperature, and measurement of the dimensional changes following section stretching and mounting at various temperatures. Data obtained from these techniques enabled a multi-purpose GMA embedding medium to be precisely specified. The infiltration solution, as well as the accelerator solution, of this mixture contains fewer toxic components than comparable systems. The infiltration solution consists of GMA monomer and a non-toxic plasticizer (2-isopropoxy ethanol). The initiator is a 50% damped dibenzoyl peroxide, and the accelerator solution is composed of a mixture of polyethylene glycol 200 and a low concentration of a low toxicity tertiary amine (N,N,3,5-tetramethylaniline). Resin blocks obtained from this mixture are highly transparent, do not become coloured, and are easy to cut at 0.5-2.0-mu-m. Various histological techniques, such as routine embedding of implanted biomaterials, histochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry were carried out; the new GMA embedding medium proved to be applicable in all the techniques without laborious modifications.","UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT PATHOL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS; HERAEUS KULZER GMBH,W-6393 WEHRHEIM,GERMANY; UNIV SHEFFIELD,DEPT BIOMED SCI,SHEFFIELD S10 2TN,S YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND","GERRITS, PO (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT ANAT & EMBRYOL,69 OOSTERSINGEL,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,29,11,11,0,3,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,189,198,,,,,,10,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300001,,,,,2019-02-25

Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus hominis strains were examined for adhesion and proliferation morphology to polyurethane foam and smooth silicone rubber prosthetic biomaterials. Ruthenium red, alcian blue and ruthenium red-lysine in en bloc procedures were applied to optimally visualize the polysaccharide slime. Ruthenium red processing resulted in observation of additional outer material close to the cell wall, more than seen in the absence of cationic reagent. Alcian blue preserved fibrous or net-like strands or meshworks of material. Ruthenium red-lysine preserved considerable amounts of slime covering the cocci as well as extending between them and the prosthetic surface. Elongate strands of slime appeared to facilitate attachment to the substrate and projection of cells away from the substrate. Where this material was lacking, cell mass buildup was required for projection from the substrate. The amount of fibrous material observed corresponded to levels of slime production known for each staphylococci strain. Some extracellular material was observed for even the classified ""non-slime"" S. hominis strain SP2.

DSC cross-linked with hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDSC) had already been tested previously. In the present study, we compared tissue interactions of non-cross-linked DSC (NDSC) and glutaraldehyde-cross-linked DSC (GDSC) with those of HDSC. To gain more insight in the relation between basophil-like cells, foreign body multinucleate giant (FBM-G) cells derived from them, and aluminum/silicate (Al/Si)-crystals, we also implanted agarose-embedded Al/Si-crystals. GDSC induced early after implantation extensive lipid formation, cell degeneration and death, but NDSC did not have any cytotoxic effects. Basophil-like (FBM-G) cells specifically dealt with Al/Si-crystals, because they were attracted by the agarose-embedded Al/Si-crystals. These cells were also attracted by GDSC and NDSC, where Al/Si-crystals are present. Accumulation of Al/Si-crystals was especially prominent with GDSC. Degradation by phagocytosis was in part carried out by FBM-G cells, derived from macrophages or fibroblasts, and observed only with GDSC, which indicates that the presence of cross-links is a prerequisite for their formation.","TWENTE UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT CHEM TECHNOL,7500 AE ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS","VANWACHEM, PB (reprint author), UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT HISTOL & CELL BIOL,BIOMAT RES SECT,OOSTERSINGEL 692,9713 EZ GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,48,19,19,0,1,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,3,,,,,251,263,,,,,,13,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,GK713,WOS:A1991GK71300007,,,,,2019-02-25

Matrix vesicle (MV) numbers, diameters, distances to calcifying fronts, and numbers of MV-types were recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and histomorphometry. Implants were surrounded by time-dependent and implant-dependent primary calcification. The bonding type displayed more intratibial bone than the non-bonding type. Bone-bonding implants supported mineralization via increased MV numbers when compared to metal oxide containing non-bonding implants. High MV diameters correlated with a high osteoblastic forming capacity in both implants. The intravesicular crystal formation around bone-bonding implants was slightly delayed. At 6 days , MV distances to calcifying fronts were significantly smaller in non-bonding implants. Non-bonding implants did not affect intravesicular hydroxyapatite (HA) crystal growth significantly, which contradicts in vitro findings. They affected osteoblastic function via a reduced production of MV and extracellular matrix (ECM). Osteoblastic function and the growth of calcifying fronts might be disturbed by leached metal oxides rather than MV function. Techniques and parameters used here may serve as means of batch-testing surface reactives and other biomaterials.","FREE UNIV BERLIN,KLINIKUM STEGLITZ,INST PATHOL,HINDENBURGDAMM 30,W-1000 BERLIN 45,GERMANY; FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST ANAT,W-1000 BERLIN 33,GERMANY; HEBREW UNION COLL,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90007; HEBREW UNION COLL,DEPT PERIODONT,LOS ANGELES,CA 90007; HEBREW UNION COLL,DIV ORAL PATHOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90007; UNIV TEXAS,DEPT ORTHOPAED,SAN ANTONIO,TX 78285",,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,SCANNING MICROSCOPY INT,CHICAGO,"PO BOX 66507, AMF O'HARE, CHICAGO, IL 60666",1051-6794,,,CELL MATER,Cells Mat.,,1991.0,1.0,4,,,,,341,352,,,,,,12,"Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,HX409,WOS:A1991HX40900007,,,,,2019-02-25

In vitro studies of platelet adhesion in flowing blood have become possible due to the development of suitable perfusion chambers. With the use of such chambers, adhesion to subendothelium and to isolated connective tissue components from the vessel wall has been realized. Such studies have begun to shed light on the molecular basis of the adhesion process. Von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibronectin, and collagen types I and III have been shown to be the most important adhesive proteins. The functional domains involved in vWF and fibronectin are being identified and the platelet receptors for these ligands have been established. A complicated picture of multiple mutually supportive ligand-receptor interactions has emerged. These insights are critical for the development of thrombo-resistant biomaterials.","WAKE FOREST UNIV,BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,WINSTON SALEM,NC 27103","SIXMA, JJ (reprint author), UNIV HOSP UTRECHT,DEPT HAEMATOL,G03 647,POB 85500,3508 GA UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,46,17,17,0,2,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

The surfaces studied included polyethylene (PE), silicone rubber (SR), Teflon-FEP (FEP), and two polyetherurethanes: one with a poly(tetramethylene oxide) soft segment (PTMO-PU) and one with a poly(ethylene oxide) soft segment (PEO-PU). The adsorption of these proteins from single-component solutions followed the Freundlich isotherm and the adhesive proteins showed similar trends in Freundlich parameters for surfaces of similar surface wettability. Adsorption from a quaternary-component solution composed of physiological molar ratios of the three proteins and human serum albumin (HSA) revealed a significant enrichment of adsorbed vitronectin as determined from ratios of the adsorbed surface fraction of each protein to its respective bulk fraction. The other proteins' adsorption was enriched to a lesser extent in the decreasing order of FGN > FN > HSA for all surfaces. The relative enrichment of VN from plasma was also high as compared with its bulk concentration, whereas the enrichment of FGN, FN, and HSA was much lower and of approximately the same magnitude. Compared with the three other proteins, VN showed a resistance to displacement from the polymer substrates as either the plasma concentration was increased or the length of contact with plasma and diluted plasma was increased.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT CHEM ENGN,1415 W JOHNSON DR,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-21001, HL-24046]",,,53,70,70,2,28,VSP BV,ZEIST,"PO BOX 346, 3700 AH ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0920-5063,,,J BIOMAT SCI-POLYM E,J.

In this paper attention is directed rather to the antecedent transport phenomena necessary to deliver successive proteins to a surface. The different limitations on protein arrival fixed by the total quantity present and by the rates of transport of super-sufficient quantities are distinguished. The transport perspective is then used to ask, and partly answer, the question: Can protein displacement be responsible for patterns of thrombus formation and cellular adhesion that are seen on the blood-wetted surfaces of devices found in medical practice: artificial organs and vascular prostheses?

All materials induced a close tissue reaction. There was no statistical difference between the tested materials regarding the time-evolution of the inflammatory cells. However, when comparing CP Ti with 316L, a significant difference was found in the fibrocyte kinetics: in the short term, fibrocyte densities were lower for 316L, while beyond 12 weeks, they exhibited higher values than CP Ti. To a lesser extent, a similar observation was made when comparing CP Ti with Ti5Al2.5Fe. No statistical difference was found in the comparison of CP Ti with Ti6Al4V.

We here report an in vitro biomechanical evaluation of a biodegradable particulate composite that might be used for similar purposes. The composite includes a matrix phase consisting of a hydrolyzable prepolymer [polypropylene fumarate (PPF)] cross-linked with methacrylate monomer, and a particulate phase consisting of tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. We implanted dynamic hip screws in 22 cadaveric proximal femora and measured the yield load for an oblique force applied to the femoral head. The hip screws were then reinforced with either PMMA or the PPF composite and tested again. On the basis of analysis of variance, the average increases in yield load for PMMA and PPF reinforcement of 1,750 and 1,130 N were statistically significant (p < 0.00005), suggesting that both materials enhance congruence between implant and bone and thereby increase the projected load-bearing area of the implant. The increase in yield force with PMMA was slightly higher than the increase with PPF (p < 0.05), but both values after reinforcement were close (3,790 +/- 561 N for PMMA vs. 3,240 +/- 669 N for PPF). If we can demonstrate that appropriate rates of degradation, bony ingrowth, and static and fatigue properties can be achieved in vivo with this system, our data suggest that this PPF composite may have potential as an adjunct to the internal fixation of unstable fractures of the osteoporotic hip.","BETH ISRAEL HOSP,CHARLES A DANA RES INST,DEPT ORTHOPAED SURG,ORTHOPAED BIOMECH LAB,BOSTON,MA 02215; HARVARD UNIV,SCH MED,BOSTON,MA 02115",,,,,NIDCD NIH HHS [CDC CR102550],,,26,24,24,0,2,JOURNAL BONE JOINT SURGERY INC,NEEDHAM,"20 PICKERING ST, NEEDHAM, MA 02192",0736-0266,,,J ORTHOPAED RES,J.

Yet commercial polymers are in general unsatisfactory biomaterials. This is due to variability in composition, stability, surface smoothness, and the presence of impurities during production. On the other hand we have already successfully demonstrated that many of the mechanical and physical properties of polymers can be substantially improved by modifications of the surface by simple ion irradiation. Ion irradiation and track etch techniques have been used in a study of the surface properties of polymeric biomaterials, including polyetheylene, and teflon. The experimental results on surface improvement - especially wear, and stability under irradiation are discussed against the theoretical background of ion ranges and energy deposition in the polymer at the atomic/molecular level. Some new and exciting potential commercial applications are briefly referred to. There are implications for all polymeric biomaterials in this most recent practical approach to modification of basic physico-chemical properties.

However, there is continuing debate in the literature regarding their long term stability in biomedical environments, and the validity of using polyurethanes for extended implant applications is still very much in question. While evidence of polymer degradation in explanted devices has been reported by a number of workers, other studies conclude that degradation is minimal. This review discusses possible pathways of biomedical degradation, such as enzymatic and oxidative attack, as well as observed effects such as cracking and calcification. Metal catalyzed degradation may also occur in devices such as pacemaker leads. While a number of model studies have assessed various modes of degradation, reliable accelerated tests for the prediction of the rates of biomedical ageing effects have apparently not been established. The role of additives and surface contaminants in biocompatibility and degradation is also discussed. Finally, as important interactions between a polyurethane polymer and the host body occur at the interface, the surface analysis of polyurethanes is discussed, and it is concluded that proper characterization of the implant surface before and after degradation studies is important for the understanding of degradation, in particular to exclude effects caused not by the polyurethane itself, but by surface contaminants which appear to have been present on the majority of materials subjected to detailed characterization so far.",,"GRIESSER, HJ (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV CHEM & POLYMERS,PRIVATE BAG 10,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA.",,"Griesser, Hans/E-5628-2011","Griesser, Hans/0000-0003-1072-7863",,,,92,62,62,4,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0141-3910,,,POLYM DEGRAD STABIL,Polym.

They are artificial kidney, artificial lung, artificial skin, artificial pancreas, and artificial cornea. The membranes in these artificial organs are mostly employed to allow the selective permeation of some substances, similar to those in industrial applications. However, biocompatibility is additionally required in the medical applications of these membranes. It is shown that coupling of poly(ethylene glycol) onto the cellulose membrane used for hemodialysis greatly improves the blood compatibility, while graft polymerization of acrylamide onto a silicone membrane used for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation largely reduces clot formation on the surface. The silicone membrane is shown to be effective also for protection of damaged skin, when used with a porous collagen sheet. It is further demonstrated that poly(vinyl alcohol) membranes without and with immobilized collagen can be used for the entrapment of Langerhans islets and for the repair of damaged corneal tissue, respectively.",,"IKADA, Y (reprint author), KYOTO UNIV, BIOMED ENGN RES CTR, 53 KAWAHARA CHO, SAKYO KU, KYOTO 606, JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,19,19,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",0032-3896,1349-0540,,POLYM J,Polym.

Nine 20-30 lb swine underwent posterior spinal fusion at T5-T6, T13-T14, and L2-L3. Autogenous bone, cryopreserved allograft bone, or equal parts of allograft bone and tricalcium phosphate were added to the decorticated posterior elements. A total of 27 sites were prepared for fusion. The spines were retrieved at 6 months and evaluated for integrity and stability of the fusion sites by clinical examination, three-point bending tests, multiplanar radiographs, and undecalcified tetracycline-labeled and decalcified histologic sections. The nine sites that received autogenous bone were solidly fused. There were one clinical and two radiographic nonunions in the nine sites that received cryopreserved allograft bone. Sites that received a mixture of allograft bone and tricalcium phosphate demonstrated slight motion at two locations and radiographic evidence of fusion at all levels. The extent and degree of fusion was not site-specific. Three-point bending analysis did not demonstrate a significant trend as to site or materials specificity. No adverse histologic response was noted. Histologic sections and tetracycline labels confirmed abundant new bone formation at all sites at 6 months. Although autogenous bone remains the gold standard for use in spinal arthrodesis, this study demonstrates the value of cryopreserved allograft bone alone and in combination with tricalcium phosphate in promoting spinal fusion.","UNIV ALABAMA,DIV ORTHOPAED SURG,619 S 19TH ST,BIRMINGHAM,AL 35233",,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,0,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",0362-2436,,,SPINE,SPINE,,1991.0,16.0,8,,S,,,S330,S333,,,,,,4,Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,GB441,WOS:A1991GB44100005,1785082.0,,,,2019-02-25
