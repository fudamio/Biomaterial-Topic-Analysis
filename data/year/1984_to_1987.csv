The magnitude of the piezoelectric constant is proportional to the degree of crystallinity, the degree of orientation and the piezoelectric constants in single crystal, as illustrated for wood. The superposition of instantaneous and relaxational polarizations may account for the sign reversal of the piezoelectric constant for oriented amylose film when temperature increases from -150 degrees C to 50 degrees C. The piezoelectric constant for oriented polyhydroxybutyrate film is shown to be the sum of contributions from crystalline phase and oriented noncrystalline phase with opposite sign. The increase of the latter with increasing temperature may explain the relaxation of the piezoelectric constant at the glass transition around 20 degrees C. When a d.c. field is biased, isotropic polymer systems such as gelatin may show apparent induced piezoelectricity through the stress-induced change of capacitance and conductivity. Application of a piezoelectnc polymer film in vivo enhances the metabolic activity of bone cell and promotes osteogenesis.","Inst Phys & Chem Res, Wako, Saitama 351, Japan","Fukada, E (reprint author), Inst Phys & Chem Res, Wako, Saitama 351, Japan.",,,,,,,20,21,21,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0015-0193,,,FERROELECTRICS,Ferroelectrics,,1984.0,60,1,,,,,285,296,,10.1080/00150198408017529,,,,12,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Condensed Matter",Materials Science; Physics,V15HS,WOS:000207793700008,,,,,2019-02-25
