By emulsion freeze-drying method, four types of porous scaffolds were prepared from amorphous poly(4-methy-epsilon-caprolactone) (PMCL) and semi-crystalline poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) at different weight ratios, named as PMCLO, PMCL30, PMCL50 and PMCL70, respectively. Visual observation on cross-sectional images of the scaffolds appeared as sponge-like materials with three-dimensional and highly porous morphologies. However, the pore size, porosity and wettability of blends were not decreased linearly with increasing amorphous PMCL. Distinguished from PMCL30 or PMCL70, PMCL50 preserved intact PCL crystals distributed in amorphous matrix, resulting in the lowest Young's modulus (E) and relatively high wettability. From in vitro cell culture, it was observed that PMCL50 scaffold supported human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps) proliferation and function preservation best among all scaffolds. hiHeps on PMCL50 inclined to adopt fibroblastic morphology, whereas formed spheroidal morphology on PMCLO. It was suggested that our bare scaffolds with tailored properties have shown remarkable capability towards hiHep proliferation and function expression.","[Xiao, Yan; Zhou, Miaomiao; Lang, Meidong] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Ultrafine Mat, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mi; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Yan] East China Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Bioreactor Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China","Xiao, Y; Zhou, Y; Lang, MD (reprint author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",yxiao@ecust.edu.cn; zhouyan@ecust.edu.cn; mdlang@ecust.edu.cn,,"Xiao, Yan/0000-0003-0720-0374",National Natural Science Foundation of China [21674037]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [18ZR1410200]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1100703]; Basic Research Key Program Project of Commission of Science and Technology of Shanghai [16JC1400203],"Financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21674037), the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (18ZR1410200), the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC1100703) and the Basic Research Key Program Project of Commission of Science and Technology of Shanghai (16JC1400203) were gratefully acknowledged.",,49,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-7765,1873-4367,,COLLOID SURFACE B,Colloid Surf.

While hydroxyapatite (HA)/graphene composites had been utilized for improving the cell adhesion and bone osteogenesis, the impact of cell adhesion and HA/graphene composites, especially HA/hydrophilic graphene (HG) composites, on internal interaction force and external surface properties remained poorly understood. Here, higher stability HA/HG composites were synthesized without extra ion introduction with in situ self-assembling method. And with XRD, FT-IR, XPS and Raman analyses, the evidences of the formation of HA and the introduction of HG was clear. TEM and SEM images showed the net-like spatial structure due to the internal interaction force between HA and HG, which provided the strain stimulation for cell adhesion. Subsequently, the external surface properties of HA/HG composites demonstrated that the roughness and hydrophilic ability of HA/HG composites could be artificially regulated by increasing the content of HG. Besides, the cell proliferation rate of HA/HG composites had been investigated. Compared to the intrinsic HA, HA/5%HG possessed the higher cell proliferation rate (264.81%) and promoted the spreading and growth of MC3T3-E1 cells. Finally, the regulation mechanism between HA/HG and cell adhesion were illuminated in detail. The excellent regular behavior of HA/HG composites for cell adhesion made them promising candidates for bone reconstruction and repairing. The present work provided the reference for the design of modifiable biomaterials and offered much inspiration for the future research of bone reconstruction engineering.","[Wang, Pengjun; Yu, Tengbo; Lv, Qiulan; Li, Shaoke; Ma, Xuexiao; Xu, Daxing; Liu, Xiu; Wang, Guangtao; Xing, Shi-chao] Qingdao Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tengbo; Xing, Shi-chao] Qingdao Univ, Inst Sports Med & Hlth, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Lv, Qiulan; Ma, Xuexiao; Xing, Shi-chao] Shandong Orthopaed & Traumatol Inst, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guanpin] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zeqing] Fudan Univ, Acad Engn & Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Xing, Shi-chao] Kings Coll London, Sch Cardiovasc Med & Sci, BHF Ctr, London SE5 9NU, England","Xing, SC (reprint author), Qingdao Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.",xingshichao@qdu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [8167061120, 81100554]; Young and Middle-Aged Scientists Research Awards Fund of Shandong Province [BS2012YY003]; Scientific and Technical Development Project of Department of health of Shandong Province [2011QZ007, 2016WS0259]; Shandong Province Natural Science Fund Project [ZR2014HM015]; Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Program [J14LK11]; postdoctoral innovation special fund of Shandong Province [201703030]; application foundation research project in source innovation plan of Qingdao City [18-2-2-31-jch]; Scientific and Technical Development Project of Qingdao [12-1-4-20-jc, 2012-1-3-2-(1)-nsh, 2013-13-008-YY, 2014-1-72, 17-3-3-15-nsh]; post-doctoral applied research project of Qingdao City","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (8167061120, 81100554), Young and Middle-Aged Scientists Research Awards Fund of Shandong Province (BS2012YY003), the Scientific and Technical Development Project of Department of health of Shandong Province(2011QZ007 and 2016WS0259), Shandong Province Natural Science Fund Project(ZR2014HM015), a Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Program (J14LK11), postdoctoral innovation special fund of Shandong Province (201703030), post-doctoral applied research project of Qingdao City and application foundation research project in source innovation plan of Qingdao City (18-2-2-31-jch) and the Scientific and Technical Development Project of Qingdao (12-1-4-20-jc, 2012-1-3-2-(1)-nsh, 2013-13-008-YY, 2014-1-72 and 17-3-3-15-nsh).",,37,0,0,13,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-7765,1873-4367,,COLLOID SURFACE B,Colloid Surf.

In many cases, biomaterial assemblies are designed to mimic biological systems. Although biomaterials have been thoroughly characterized in many aspects, not much quantitative information on the molecular level interactions between different biomaterials is available. That information is very important, on the one hand, to understand the properties of biological systems and, on the other hand, to develop new composite biomaterials for special applications. This work presents a systematic, quantitative analysis of self- and cross-interactions between films of collagen I (Col I), collagen IV (Col IV), laminin (LN-521), and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), that is, biomaterials of different nature and structure that either exist in biological systems (e.g., extracellular matrices) or have shown potential for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering. Direct surface forces and adhesion between biomaterials-coated spherical micro-particles and flat substrates were measured in phosphate-buffered saline using an atomic force microscope and the colloidal probe technique. Different methods (Langmuir-Schaefer deposition, spin-coating, or adsorption) were applied to completely coat the flat substrates and the spherical micro particles with homogeneous biomaterial films. The adhesion between biomaterials films increased with the time that the films were kept in contact. The strongest adhesion was observed between Col IV films, and between Col IV and LN-521 films after 30 s contact time. In contrast, low adhesion was measured between CNF films, as well as between CNF and LN-521 films. Nevertheless, a good adhesion between CNF and collagen films (especially Col I) was observed. These results increase our understanding of the structure of biological systems and can support the design of new matrices or scaffolds where different biomaterials are combined for diverse biological or medical applications.","[Nugroho, Robertus Wahyu N.; Harjumaki, Riina; Zhang, Xue; Valle-Delgado, Juan Jose; Osterberg, Monika] Aalto Univ, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst, Sch Chem Engn, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Harjumaki, Riina; Lou, Yan-Ru; Yliperttula, Marjo] Univ Helsinki, Div Pharmaceut Biosci, Fac Pharm, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Yliperttula, Marjo] Univ Padua, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Valle-Delgado, JJ; Osterberg, M (reprint author), Aalto Univ, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst, Sch Chem Engn, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",juanjose.valledelgado@aalto.fi; monika.osterberg@aalto.fi,"Osterberg, Monika/C-3929-2013","Osterberg, Monika/0000-0002-3558-9172; Harjumaki, Riina/0000-0002-1583-0379; Lou, Yan-Ru/0000-0001-7717-6010",Academy of Finland [278279],"This work was funded by the Academy of Finland (project number 278279, MIMEGEL).

In the present work, an attempt has been made to develop a HAp coating using a novel thermal spray process called axial suspension plasma spraying (SPS), which leads to thin adherent coatings. Two HAp coatings fabricated by APS (P1 and P2) and four SPS HAp coatings (S1, S2, S3 and S4) produced with varying spraying parameters were characterized in terms of (1) microstructure, porosity, hardness, adhesion strength, contact angle and phase purity; (2) corrosion resistance in 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS); (3) in-vitro cell adherence and cell viability using human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Amongst different APS and SPS coatings, P1 and S3 exhibited superior properties. S3 coating developed using SPS exhibited 1.3 times higher adhesion strength when compared to APS coating (P1) and 9.5 times higher corrosion resistance than P1.

Silk fibroin film cytocompatibility and the effect of silk fibroin on chondrocytes in vitro were also evaluated. Methods: Chondrocytes were transfected with a lentivirus containing a green fluorescent protein marker and cultured within a regenerated silk fibroin film. Effects on chondrocyte adhesion, growth, and expression of functional collagen II were assessed in vitro by analysis with immunofluorescent histochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Results: The results of this study showed that the regenerated silk fibroin film had no cytotoxic effect on chondrocytes. The regenerated silk fibroin film facilitated the adhesion of chondrocytes with typical morphology. Chondrocytes cultured within silk fibroin films exhibited the expression of collagen II in vitro. Conclusion: Regenerated silk fibroin film was found to be an excellent biomaterial with good cytocompatibility for chondrocytes, because these cells remained functional and maintained normal cell morphology when cultured in silk-based biomaterials.

Achieving efficient recruitment of MSCs to defective or damaged tissues in vivo has been a difficult hurdle. The aim of the present study was to construct a biomaterial that can effectively recruit BMSCs to facilitate the repair of pathological tissues. So functional -tricalcium phosphate (-TCP) was synthesized using the BMSC affinity peptide DPIYALSWSGMA (DPI) adsorbed onto -TCP through an adsorption/freeze-drying strategy. C57BL/6 mouse-derived BMSCs were seeded onto the DPI peptide-modified -TCP (-TCP-DPI); in vitro experiments demonstrated that -TCP-DPI enhanced BMSC adhesion and proliferation compared with unmodified -TCP.

Despite their promising biocompatibility and biomimetic properties, they have never been considered real competitors of polymers and/or cross-linked extracellular matrix (ECM) natural proteins. Indeed, synthetic SAP-made hydrogels usually feature modest mechanical properties, limiting their potential applications, due to the transient non-covalent interactions involved in the self-assembling phenomenon. Cross-linked SAP-hydrogels have been recently introduced to bridge this gap, but several questions remain open. New strategies leading to stiffer gels of SAPs may allow for a full exploitation of the SAP technology in TE and beyond. We have developed and characterized a genipin cross-linking strategy significantly increasing the stiffness and resiliency of FAQ(LDLK)(3), a functionalized SAP already used for nervous cell cultures. We characterized different protocols of cross-linking, analyzing their dose and time-dependent efficiency, influencing stiffness, bioabsorption time and molecular arrangements. We choose the best developed protocol to electrospin into nanofibers, for the first time, self-standing, water-stable and flexible fibrous mats and micro-channels entirely made of SAPs. This work may open the door to the development and tailoring of bioprostheses entirely made of SAPs for different TE applications.","[Pugliese, Raffaele; Maleki, Mahboubeh; Gelain, Fabrizio] IRCSS Casa Sollievo Sofferenza, Unita Ingn Tissutale, Viale Cappuccini 1, I-71013 San Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy; [Pugliese, Raffaele; Gelain, Fabrizio] ASST Grande Osped Metropolitano Niguarda, CNTE, Piazza Osped Maggiore 3, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Gelain, F (reprint author), IRCSS Casa Sollievo Sofferenza, Unita Ingn Tissutale, Viale Cappuccini 1, I-71013 San Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy.; Gelain, F (reprint author), ASST Grande Osped Metropolitano Niguarda, CNTE, Piazza Osped Maggiore 3, I-20162 Milan, Italy.",f.gelain@css-mendel.it,,"Pugliese, Raffaele/0000-0001-7669-4457; Maleki, Mahboubeh/0000-0001-5746-4736; Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860","Ricerca Corrente - Italian Ministry of Health; ""5 x 1000"" voluntary contributions; Office of Science [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Revert donation; Vertical Onlus donation","The work described and performed by R.

The migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into bone defect sites or material implantation sites, and their differentiation into osteoblasts, is central to the fracture healing process, and the directional migration of BMSCs depends on cytokines or chemokines at the defect site. BMP-2 can stimulate the migration of a variety of cells, but it remains unclear whether BMSC migration can be induced. To provide evidence for BMP-2-induced BMSC migration, we tested the cytoskeletal changes and migration ability of BMSCs after treatment with recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2). We also explored the recruitment of BMSCs from the circulatory system using a collagen sponge incorporating rhBMP-2 that was implanted in vivo. Furthermore, to understand the mechanism underlying this migration, we investigated the effect of rhBMP-2 on migration-related signal pathways. Here, we found that, rhBMP-2 treatment significantly increased the migration of BMSCs in vitro via activation of the CDC42/PAK1/LIMK1 pathway, and that this migration could be blocked by silencing CDC42. In vivo, collagen sponge material loaded with rhBMP-2 could recruit BMSCs injected into the circulatory system. Moreover, inhibition using the small interfering RNA for CDC42 led to a significant decrease in the number of BMSCs within the material. In conclusion, our data prove that rhBMP-2 can accelerate BMSC migration via the CDC42/PAK1/LIMK1 pathway both in vivo and in vitro, and therefore provides a foundation for further understanding and application of rhBMP-2-incorporated materials by enhancing BMSC recruitment.","[Liu, Shuhao; Jiang, Libo; Li, Zheng; Lee, Soomin; Zhang, Jian] Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang; Liu, Changsheng; Wang, Jing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Bioreactor Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang; Liu, Changsheng; Wang, Jing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Biomed Mat, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China","Zhang, J (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.; Wang, J (reprint author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Bioreactor Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.; Wang, J (reprint author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Biomed Mat, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",biomatwj@163.com; zhang.jian@zs-hospital.sh.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31330028, 81702177]",The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31330028 and 81702177).,,46,0,0,7,7,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2047-4830,2047-4849,,BIOMATER SCI-UK,Biomater.

Molecular treatments that require the delivery of therapeutic gene vectors are often less effective that specific, targeted approaches, and the scientific evidence for acellular biomaterial-assisted procedures is limited. Controlled delivery of gene vectors using biocompatible materials is emerging as a novel strategy for the sustained and tuneable release of gene therapies in a spatiotemporally precise manner, thereby reducing intra-articular vector spread and possible loss of the therapeutic gene product. Controlled, biomaterial-guided delivery of gene vectors could be used to enhance intrinsic mechanisms of cartilage repair while affording protection against potentially damaging host immune responses that might counteract the gene therapy component. This Review provides an overview of advances in gene vector-loaded biomaterials for articular cartilage repair. Such systems enable the sustained release of gene therapies while maintaining transduction efficacy. Strategies that harness these properties are likely to result in improved in situ cartilage tissue regeneration that could be safely translated into clinical applications in the near future.","[Cucchiarini, Magali; Madry, Henning] Saarland Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Expt Orthopaed, Homburg, Germany; [Cucchiarini, Magali; Madry, Henning] Saarland Univ, Homburg, Germany; [Madry, Henning] Saarland Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Med Ctr, Homburg, Germany","Cucchiarini, M (reprint author), Saarland Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Expt Orthopaed, Homburg, Germany.; Cucchiarini, M (reprint author), Saarland Univ, Homburg, Germany.",mmcucchiarini@hotmail.com,,,,,,197,0,0,20,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1759-4790,1759-4804,,NAT REV RHEUMATOL,Nat.

Polycaprolactone was used as the main polymeric matrix with and without addition of hydroxyapatite. In vivo studies on the standard critical size defect in tibia and parietal bone were performed using Wistars models: 3x2 and 5x1 dimensions, respectively. The animals were sacrificed after 32 days; neobone formation was assessed with the histological data. The in vivo data demonstrated differences between the tibia and parietal bone groups: the influence of the bone on the neobone's formation was notable. All the tibia defect samples had greater neobone volume when compared to the parietal data. Indeed, these bones have distinct embryology, influence of mechanical forces and vascularization rate that are well known; moreover, these characteristics were demonstrated to be critical for neobone formation.","[Camargo Cardoso, Guinea Brasil; de Carvalho Zavaglia, Cecilia Amelia] Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Engn Meccan, Dept Engn Mat, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Camargo Cardoso, Guinea Brasil; de Carvalho Zavaglia, Cecilia Amelia] Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Biofabricacao INCT Bio, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Chacon, Erivelto Luis; Barbosa Maia, Luis Ricardo; da Cunha, Marcelo Rodrigues] Fac Med Jundiai, Dept Morfol Patol, Jundiai, SP, Brazil","Cardoso, GBC (reprint author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Engn Meccan, Dept Engn Mat, Campinas, SP, Brazil.; Cardoso, GBC (reprint author), Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Biofabricacao INCT Bio, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",guicardoso@fem.unicamp.br,,,"Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp) [2009/54546-9, 2013/19472-0]",This work was funded by grants from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp 2009/54546-9 and 2013/19472-0).

The samples were acid digested and analyzed using ICPMS for trace elements content. The mean concentration of Elements followed descending order of Zn > Mg > Fe > Cr > Al > Sn > Sr > Ti > Cu > As > Cd and Mg > Zn > Fe > Cr > Al > Sn > Ti > Cu > Sr > As > Cd in hair and nails, respectively. Overall, the concentration of elements was found to be high in female subject as compared to male. The concentration of trace elements in hair and nail exceeded the maximum permissible limits in most cases. The corresponding mean values from dust samples were fairly high as compared to background values of trace elements. Middle age groups (21-30 years and 31-40 years) were observed to be the most vulnerable there-by posing a high health risk, as the concentration of trace elements was significantly high in these groups except for Al, which was detected high in age < 20 in case of both male and female. A significantly high correlation was found between trace elements in biomaterials and those detected in dust samples. In hair samples, a significantly positive correlation was noticed for As with Mg, Zn, Sn and Fe, Sn/Mg and Mg/Ti. In the case of nails, a significant correlation was observed for elements like Al, Mg, Zn, Cr, and Cu. The Cluster and principal component analysis revealed industrial and vehicular emissions as main sources for trace elements exposure in humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Motor recovery after a nerve gap-lesion repaired by artificial nerve-guides (""conduits"") is often less complete and slower than sensory recovery. The mechanism for this is not fully understood. New method: Incubation in sheep polyclonal choline acetyltransferase antibody (Abeam 18,736) at dilution of 1:150 was followed by incubation in mouse monoclonal anti-myelin basic protein antibody (Abeam 62,631) at a dilution of 1:5000. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin QS (Vector Labs H-3404). Results: Immunostaining of choline acetyltransferase and myelin basic protein can be combined together and results show a good contrast between the light brown of the choline acetyltransferase reaction product and the green of myelin basic protein reaction product. Cell nuclei are stained blue. This new protocol retains the advantages of paraffin embedded sections such as (i) having a relatively simple methodology, (ii) years-long storage life, and (iii) easy sharing among laboratories. Comparison with existing method. This specific combinatorial protocol has never been used before on paraffin embedded sections. It has been named ""reciprocal nerve staining"" (RNS). Conclusions: Routine combination of choline acetyltransferase and myelin basic protein immunostaining provides a highly specific, highly contrasted paraffin-embedded sections where optical differentiation of myelinated motor fibers is easy and straightforward. This method will likely simplify and speed-up the routine histological study of nerve regeneration and will contribute a better identification of the nerve motor component.","[Merolli, Antonio; Kohn, Joachim] Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Ctr Biomat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Louro, Pedro] Rutgers State Univ, Res Pathol Serv, Piscataway, NJ USA","Merolli, A (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Ctr Biomat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",,,"Merolli, Antonio/0000-0001-5704-2066",National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health [R01NS078385],Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01NS078385.

AD depends on the coordinated activity of hydrolysis, acidification and methanogenesis. However, the effect of mixing intensity on characteristics of hydrolysis and acidification in AD of SS is still poorly understood. This study focused on the mixing intensity (30, 60, 90 and 120 rpm) effect on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the key microorganisms in the hydrolysis and acidification of SS. Results showed that enhanced hydrolysis and acidification efficiency was obtained at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm (p < 0.05), while the maximum acetic acid (388 +/- 21 mg/L) was produced at 90 rpm. Mixing at 90 rpm enhanced the release of protein and polysaccharide as well as humic acid. Further analyses of DOM molecular features revealed that 90 rpm led to the highest molecular diversity and easily biodegradable molecules (lipid and proteins/amino sugars), which contributed to the maximum hydrolysis and acidification efficiency. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria significantly increased with mixing intensity (p<0.05), and Chloroflexi and Fusobacteria were enriched at mixing of 90 rpm, which favored the hydrolysis of SS. The enrichment of Clostridium XI and Clostridium sensu strict contributed to the acidification of DOM at 90 and 120 rpm. The results of this study can advance our knowledge about mixing intensity effects on the AD systems of SS. This research also showed how increasing mixing intensity to a relatively high speed can enhance the hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of SS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous strategies have been developed for the treatment of wounds, including skin substitutes, biomembranes, scaffolds, and smart dressings. The excellent properties of fibroin can be exploited for the development of advanced wound dressing biomaterials, aiming at promoting the wound healing process. In this work, silk fibroin films modified through the addition of glucose were developed to enhance flexibility of medical device without affecting the biocompatibility, to promote wound healing and to improve the patient well-being. The glucose/fibroin blend was characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry to analyze the protein structure. Absorption capacity, mechanical properties, wettability and bacterial biofilm formation on silk fibroin films were also analyzed to study the effect of the addition of a plasticizer on the properties of the wound dressing. The stability of the films was analyzed through in vitro biodegradability tests. The biocompatibility and regenerative properties were demonstrated through appropriate cellular assays. The results demonstrated that the addition of glucose induced crystallization and provided good flexibility and absorption capacity of silk fibroin films.

Most of the strategies proposed to overcome this limitation demand multiple and expensive processing steps. This study aimed to evaluate the surface modification of 3D-printed poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds with polydopamine (PDA) coating as an alternative strategy to enhance their bioactivity and to facilitate the immobilization of type I collagen (COL I) onto the implant surface. Physical and chemical properties of PLA scaffolds coated with PDA, COL I or both were evaluated. The response of porcine bone marrow stem cells (MSCs) to the coatings was also investigated. The PDA layer improved COL immobilization onto the surface of the PLA scaffolds by 92%. The combination of PDA and COL functionalizations provided the best conditions for early-stage (<7 days) cell response. In addition, the PDA plus COL surface facilitated the robust deposition of extracellular matrix in the first 14 days of cell culture. Although the behavior of the MSCs appeared to be similar for both uncoated PLA and PDA plus COL-coated scaffolds by day 21, cells seeded onto PDA plus COL scaffolds produced substantially higher amounts of alkaline phosphatase. These results indicate that the osteoinductivity of 3D-printed PLA scaffolds can be enhanced by PDA and type I collagen coatings. This surface modification of polymeric scaffolds represents a promising strategy for bone tissue engineering. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Delamination is a common fatigue-related failure mode in UHMWPE components; however, the relationship between delamination resistance and fatigue crack growth has not been reported. Here, the delamination resistance of contemporary UHMWPE materials, including highly cross-linked UHMWPE (HXLPE), vitamin E blended UHMWPE (VEPE), and vitamin E blended HXLPE (VEXLPE), was measured to verify a previously proposed accelerated test method using a U-shaped sliding motion; the results were compared with those of fatigue crack growth tests. The oxidative stability of each material was estimated using Fourier transform infrared analysis. UHMWPE sterilized by gamma irradiation in an inert atmosphere and annealed HXLPE had lower delamination resistance than virgin UHMWPE after artificial aging. This was consistent with previous findings from retrieval studies, and in vitro knee simulator and ball-on-flat unidirectional reciprocation wear studies. In contrast, remelted HXLPE, VEPE, and VEXLPE showed excellent delamination resistance after artificial aging. The results of the delamination tests were not consistent with those of fatigue crack growth tests, indicating the complex delamination mechanism and importance of evaluating these factors separately.

We hypothesized that by using bridges made of porous biomaterial and permissive olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG), we could provide a scaffold to permit restoration of white matter tracts. We implanted porous polycaprolactone (PCL) bridges between the substantia nigra and the striatum in rats, both with and without OEG. We compared the number of tyrosine-hydroxylase positive (TH+) fibers crossing the striatal-graft interface, and the astrocytic and microglial reaction around the grafts, between animals grafted with and without OEG. Although TH+ fibers were found inside the grafts made of PCL alone, there was a greater fiber density inside the graft and at the striatal-graft interface when OEG was cografted. Also, there was less astrocytic and microglial reaction in those animals. These results show that these PCL grafts are able to promote axonal growth along the nigrostriatal pathway, and that cografting of OEG markedly enhances axonal entry inside the grafts, growth within them, and re-entry of axons into the CNS. These results may have implications in the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson's and others associated with lesions of central white matter tracts. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Objective: This study investigated surface alterations of calcium silicate-based cements after exposure to different environments. Material and Methods: Forty-eight cylindrical cavities were prepared on root surfaces. The cavities were filled using ProRoot MTA or Biodentine and assigned to four subgroups (n=6): dry, wet, acidic, and blood. Surface topographies were evaluated using an optical profilometer for 28 days, and the roughness of the material surfaces was quantified. Vertical dimensional change was measured by determining the height difference between the material surface and the flat tooth surface. Data were compared with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni tests. Results: In dry condition, the surface roughness of MTA or Biodentine was constant up to 3 days (p>0.05) but decreased after 28 days (p<0.05). In dry condition, ProRoot MTA presented constant surface level through time, while Biodentine showed decreased surface level after 28 days. In wet condition, the roughness and the surface levels of both materials increased after 1 day (p<0.05). Neither the surface roughness nor the levels of the materials showed significant changes in acidic conditions (p>0.05). Both materials showed the highest roughness in blood conditions on the lst day (p<0.05), while the surface roughness in blood decreased dramatically after 28 days. The roughness of Biodentine was higher in wet conditions up to 3 days compared with ProRoot MTA (p<0.05). Likewise, in blood condition, Biodentine showed higher roughness on the 28th day than ProRoot MTA (p<0.05). Conclusions: Dry, wet, and blood conditions had a time-dependent effect on the surface roughness and vertical dimensional changes of the materials. However, acidic conditions did not affect the roughness and the surface level of the materials.","[Aksel, Hacer; Kucukkaya Eren, Selen; Askerbeyli Ors, Sevinc] Hacettepe Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Endodont, Ankara, Turkey; [Karaismailoglu, Eda] Kastamonu Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Kastamonu, Turkey","Aksel, H (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Sch Dent Med, Dept Periodont & Endodont, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",haceraks@buffalo.edu,,"Karaismailoglu, Eda/0000-0003-3085-7809",,,,39,0,0,1,1,UNIV SAO PAULO FAC ODONTOLOGIA BAURU,BAURU-SP,"AL DR OCTAVIO PINHEIRO BRISOLLA, 9-75, BAURU-SP, 17012-901, BRAZIL",1678-7757,1678-7765,,J APPL ORAL SCI,J.

Aggregation and encapsulation into instructive biomaterials after preconditioning can bolster retention of differentiated phenotypes. Since these procedures do not depend on cell type or lineage, we hypothesized we could use a common, tunable platform to engineer formulations that retain and enhance multiple lineages from different cell populations. To test this, we varied alginate stiffness and adhesive ligand content, then encapsulated spheroids of varying cellularity. We used Design-of-Experiments to determine the effect of these parameters and their interactions on phenotype retention. The combination of parameters leading to maximal differentiation varied with lineage and cell type, inducing a 2-4-fold increase over non-optimized levels. Phenotype was also retained for 4 weeks in a murine subcutaneous model. This widely applicable approach can facilitate translation of cell-based therapies by instructing phenotype in situ without prolonged induction or costly growth factors.","[Hung, Ben P.; Harvestine, Jenna N.; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Tomas; Leach, J.

In this study, titanium (cp-Ti) was treated by a plasma enhanced fluorine (F) and oxygen (O) mono/dual chemical vapor deposition to obtain nano-functional coatings with improved antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. Using this platform, the anti-bacterial effect and the osteoblasts behavior were investigated in vitro. Meanwhile, the corrosion resistance of the fluoride coatings was also concerned. The fluorine-deposited samples can effectively kill Staphylococcus aureus and have adequate antibacterial properties. More importantly, the F and O dual-deposited coatings show the better sustaining antibacterial property after immersion in 0.9% NaCl solution up to 7 days than that of F monodeposited coatings. Besides, the cell compatibility tests indicate that the fluorine-deposited samples have no appreciable influence on the osteoblast viability and proliferation, but promote differentiation compared to the cp-Ti and O-Ti samples. F and O incorporation even shows some favorable effect on promoting cell spreading. Further, the electrochemical results demonstrate the F and O dual-deposited coating exhibiting an improved corrosion resistance due to the formation of titanium-oxygen compounds on surface. The F and O incorporated coating which provides improved antibacterial ability and biocompatibility has attractive applications in orthopedics, dentistry, and other biomedical devices.","[Chen, Mian; Li, Haixia; Qin, Gaowu; Zhang, Erlin] Northeastern Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Anisotropy & Texture Mat MoE, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoyan] Northeastern Univ, Sch Met, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Zhang, EL (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Anisotropy & Texture Mat MoE, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",zhangel@atm.neu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Erlin/N-6608-2014","Zhang, Erlin/0000-0002-6152-6546","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [N141008001, N160206003, LZ2014018]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81071262, 31271024, 51525101]","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (no.

The biocompatibility of the nanomaterial and cell phototoxicity under light irradiation were investigated on PC3 prostate tumor cells in vitro. SQ-PEG:Ppa showed excellent phototoxic effect at low light dose of 5.0 J/cm(2) as a consequence of efficient cell internalization of Ppa by the nanodelivery system.

Despite many advantages, the development of tissue -engineered constructs that can match the biological context of real tissue matrix remains a challenge in tissue engineering (TE). The tissue-engineered constructs should also support vascularization. Protein-based macromolecules, in pristine or combine form, provide a promising platform to engineer constructs with unique design and functionalities which are highly essential for an appropriate stimulation and differentiation of cells in a specific TE approach. However, much work remains to be undertaken with particular reference to in-depth interactions between constructed cues and target host tissues. Thus, modern advancements are emphasizing to understand critiques and functionalization of protein based macromolecule that organize not only cellular activities but also tissue regenerations. In this review, numerous physicochemical, functional, and structural characteristics of protein-based macromolecules such as keratin, silk fibroin, collagen, gelatin, and fibrin are discussed. This review also presents the hope vs. hype phenomenon for tissue engineering. Later part of the review focuses on different requisite characteristics and their role in TE.

Here, we have extracted, purified and part characterized the bioactivity of Jacalin, Frutalin, DAL and PNA, before evaluating their potential for wound healing in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Only Frutalin stimulated fibroblast migration in vitro, prompting further studies which established its low cytotoxicity and interaction with TLR4 receptors. Frutalin also increased p-ERK expression and stimulated IL-6 secretion. The in vivo potential of Frutalin for wound healing was then assessed in hybrid combination with the polysaccharide galactomannan, purified from Caesalpinia pulcherrima seeds, using both hydrogel and membrane scaffolds formulations. Physical-chemical characterization of the hybrid showed that lectin-galactomannan interactions increased the pseudoplastic behaviour of solutions, reducing viscosity and increasing Frutalin's concentration. Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy revealed-OH band displacement, likely caused by interaction of Frutalin with galactose residues present on galactomannan chains, while average membrane porosity was 100 gm, sufficient to ensure water vapor permeability. Accelerated angiogenesis and increased fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation were observed with the optimal hybrid recovering the lesioned area after 11 days. Our findings indicate Frutalin as a biomolecule with potential for tissue repair, regeneration and chronic wound healing.

It can be chemically modified by cross-linking, grafting, linking with hydrophobic substances and drugs, or through polyion complex formation with oppositely charged polysaccharides, proteins or surfactants. Its interpenetrating network produces self-assembled aggregates, nanoparticles and gels. The present review is aimed to provide recent updates on researches on HA, with an emphasis on different modification approaches. Various transformations in HA through covalent and non-covalent interactions and resulting applications in biomedical fields from the recent literature are described. Studies on stabilization of nanoparticles (NPs) and other colloidal carriers through layer-by-layer adsorption of HA are also highlighted. The article provides a greater visibility into the magnitude of HA application in the development of targeted drug vectors and implantable biomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The introduction of different functionalities into such ELRs could open up new possibilities for the development of advanced biomaterials for regenerative medicine and, specifically, for controlled drug delivery given their additional ability to respond to stimuli other than pH or temperature, such as glucose concentration or electromagnetic radiation. Candida antarctica lipase B immobilized on a macroporous acrylic resin (Novozym 435) was used to enzymatically couple different aminated substrates to a recombinamer containing carboxylic groups along its amino acid chain by way of an amidation reaction. A preliminary study of the kinetics of this amidation in response to different reaction conditions, such as solvent, temperature or reagent ratio, was carried out using a phenylazobenzene derivative (azo-NH2) as a model. The optimal amidation conditions were used to couple other amine reagents, such as phenylboronic acid (FB-NH2) or polyethylene glycol (PEG-NH2), thus allowing us to obtain photoresponsive, glucose-responsive or PEGylated ELRs that could potentially be useful as sensors in devices for controlled drug delivery.

This work focuses on the hydrolytic degradation and consequent morphological modification of a XGPVA film and on its interaction with cells, blood, bacteria. Biocompatibility of the film was assessed in vitro by investigating different aspects, such as cell viability, oxidative stress level, mitochondrial dysfunction and specific stress biomarkers. Partial adhesiveness was demonstrated by performing different attaching assays and phalloidin staining. Hemocompatibility of XG-PVA film after interaction with blood was evaluated by using a multi-parametric approach, including human Red Blood Cells (RBC) count, hemolytic response and platelets activation. Thrombin and fibrinogen concentrations were examined as marker of the coagulation cascade. After direct contact with human blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), no evidence of cell defense response was observed. Antimicrobial activity of XG-PVA film was tested against Escherichia coli (E.coli). XG-PVA film promotes bacterial retentivity and provides mechanical protection against bacterial infiltration. After loading the film with ampicillin, an inhibitory E. coli growth zone was observed. All together these results indicate that the XG-PVA system is a promising material to be tested in vivo for wound healing applications.

To improve the physiochemical and antimicrobial properties of these hydrogels and developing their applications, hybrid systems consisting of hydrogels, biodegradable nanoparticles and antibiotics were synthesized. In this regard, nanocomposite hydrogels based on PVA, 5% chitosan nanoparticles (NC) and various contents of tetracycline were prepared using freezing-thawing cycles and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gel fraction, swelling, antibacterial and cell viability studies, contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy, hydrolytic degradation and release studies. The MR studies showed the interaction between PVA, NC and tetracycline, and upon addition of 5% tetracycline gel fraction increases. Antibacterial and cell viability studies showed great antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and cell growth in the presence of tetracycline. NC and tetracycline well dispersed in the hydrogel matrix and upon addition of tetracycline hydrolytic degradation and hydrophilicity increased. Finally, according to the release studies, the hydrogels mechanism perfectly fitted in Peppas-Korsmeyer and Higuchi models. Therefore, according to the results, nanocomposite hydrogel containing 5% of tetracycline can be suggested as a good candidate for wound dressing and novel drug delivery systems such as colon-specific drugs.

Boron-incorporated calcium silicate (Ca11Si4B2O22, B-CS) coating has been reported as a potential candidate for improving osteogenesis in orthopedic applications in vitro. However, relatively little is known about its effects on the immune response and subsequent osteogenesis. In this work, the immunomodulatory properties of the B-CS coating and its specific mechanism of action were explored. We found that the B-CS coating decreased M1 polarization and converted macrophages to the M2 phenotype via restraining the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, thus inducing a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the B-CS coating inhibited osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic activities by downregulating osteoclastogenic genes and inhibiting the RANKL/RANK system. BMP2 and VEGF were also significantly upregulated by macrophages and bone mesenchymal stem cells, leading to activation of the BMP2 signaling pathway and subsequent upregulation of osteogenesis-associated genes, finally promoting osteogenic differentiation. These findings show that the B-CS coating could be a promising coating material for hip and knee implants. Furthermore, incorporation of the element boron into bioceramic coatings could be a good strategy in the design of bone biomaterials with beneficial immune responses. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The pore size, water adsorption capacity, and mechanical properties of scaffolds were associated with their average molecular weights. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that rapid degradation of SF scaffolds would facilitate the Schwann cells proliferation. Furthermore, in vitro enzymatic degradation and in vivo subcutaneous implantation experiments illustrated that SF scaffolds degradation behaviors could be well regulated.

Electroactive patches could enhance electrical signal propagation among cardiac cells. In the present study, an electrically active composite of collagen and graphene oxide (Col-GO) was fabricated as a cardiac patch. Col scaffolds were fabricated using a freeze-drying method and coated covalently with GO. Some scaffolds were also reduced by a reduction agent to restore the high conductivity of GO. GO was shown to be a single layer with suitable lateral size for biological application. The Col-GO scaffolds contained randomly oriented interconnected pores with appropriate pore sizes of 120-138 +/- 8 mu m. GO flakes were also well distributed in the pore walls. By increasing the GO concentration, the tensile strength of the scaffolds was enhanced from 75 kPa for Col-GO-5 to 162 kPa for Col-GO-90. Young modulus also followed the same trend. Electrical conductivity of the scaffolds was in the range of semi-conductive materials (degrees similar to 10(-4) S/m), which is suitable for cardiac tissue engineering applications. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated no toxic effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after 96 h.

Although collagen is often privileged for providing a suitable substrate on which cells can be cultured or a matrix in which cells can be dispersed, its mechanical properties represent a major limitation for clinical translation and even for handling of the obtained regenerated tissue. In this work, the combination of polysaccharides chitosan (Ch) and xanthan gum (X) was investigated as an alternative for scaffolds for soft tissue engineering. Moreover, in an attempt to reach a compromise between obtaining highly porous biomaterials while maintaining appropriate mechanical properties, a surfactant (Kolliphor (R) P188, K) was added to Ch-X matrices to generate pores, while silicone rubber (Silpuran (R) 2130A/B, S) was used to balance their mechanical properties. Addition of K (10 or 25% w/w) increased the porosity and pore dimensions, while addition of S improved by up to 156% and 85% the elastic moduli and the elastic behavior of Ch-X-based scaffolds, under both compressive and tensile loads, respectively, at 50% strain. Relaxation tests confirmed that these materials do have a viscoelastic behavior. The presence of S increased thickness and microscale surface roughness and did not affect liquid uptake and stability, thrombogenicity, biodegradation and cytotoxicity of polysaccharide-based scaffolds.

The results indicated that BMSs were kinds of spherical nanoparticles with good biocompatibility. Their in vitro and in vivo behaviors, including degradation, biodistribution and biocompatibility were mainly governed by the wettability which was closely related to the structure and pore diameter of mesoporous silica nanoparticles. BMSs can degrade completely under simulated physiological environments through a time period of 2-13 weeks. They showed the tendency of brain distribution, and the distribution amount peaked at 4 h post administration. Particularly, Trp-BMS (BMS templated by C-16-L-tryptophan) with the largest amount of -OH groups on the surface exhibited highest wettability, fastest degradation rate and the lowest brain distribution ability. Besides, His-BMS (BMS templated by C-16-L-histidine) and Pro-BMS (BMS templated by C-16-L-poline) were silica materials with good biocompatibility. Both in vitro and in vivo studies uncovered no significantly toxicity for BMSs and they were proved to be safe when they circulated into the blood. However, Trp-BMS might induce severe hemolysis and cell cycle arrest due to the high wettability. It is believed that appropriate wettability is required for the in vivo application of nanomaterials and the in vivo evaluation of mesoporous silica nanoparticles will provide useful information for understanding the underlining toxicity of biomaterials and bring new insights on designing efficient drug delivery systems.","[Li, Heran; Wei, Minjie] China Med Univ, Sch Pharm, Shenyang 110122, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Li, Heran; Yang, Baixue; Li, Jing; Xu, Lu; Liu, Hongzhuo; Li, Sanming; Yang, Mingshi] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Pharm, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xueqian; Xu, Jinghua] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biopharmaceut Sci, Wenhua RD 103, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mingshi] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark","Xu, JH (reprint author), Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biopharmaceut Sci, Wenhua RD 103, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.; Wei, MJ (reprint author), China Med Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Sch Pharm, Shenyang North New Area, 77 Puhe Rd, Shenyang 110122, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",jinghuaxu2002@tom.com; mjwei@cmu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81773672]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M590235],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81773672) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2016M590235).,,41,0,0,19,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

Gelatin- chitosan based scaffolds made of gelatin-chitosan (GC) and GC composites containing 30 wt% HAp, beta-TCP and 58s bioactive glass nanoparticles were fabricated using freeze drying technique. The porosity and compressive strength of all the prepared scaffolds were evaluated. The average pore size of all the prepared composite scaffolds was in the range between 90 and 125 mu m. Most frequent pore size in GCT 30 scaffold was the highest of 120 mu m whereas that for GCH 30 was the lowest of 96 mu m as suggested by Hg porosimetry analysis. GCH30 scaffolds showed the highest average compressive strength of 3.45 MPa as opposed to 2.24 MPa exhibited by GCB 30, with high degree of interconnected porosity appropriate for cellular colonization. To study the effect of different bioceramic phases on MSCs differentiation, scaffolds were cell cultured for up to 14 days in osteogenic medium. GCB30 scaffold showed higher capacity to proliferate MSCs cultured onto it as compared to other composite scaffolds. Degree of differentiation of MSCs into osteoblast was higher in GCB30 scaffolds than in the GCH30 and GCT30 composite scaffold as evident from higher amount of RUNX2 and osteocalcin expression in the former up to 14 days of cell culture. Inclusion of 58s bioactive glass particles showed positive effects on cell differentiation. In coherence with the in vitro appearance, histomorphometric analysis and fluorochrome study in a rabbit tibia model showed a significantly greater amount of new bone formation in GCB30 compared to other composite scaffolds. The results demonstrated that the prepared GCB30 scaffold could be a better candidate as bone substitute material for its higher bioactivity in bone tissue regeneration.","[Dasgupta, Sudip; Maji, Kanchan] NIT, Dept Ceram Engn, Rourkela, India; [Nandi, Samit Kumar] WBUAFS, Dept Vet Surg & Radiol, Kolkata, India","Dasgupta, S (reprint author), NIT, Dept Ceram Engn, Rourkela, India.",dasguptas@nitrkl.ac.in; samitnandi1967@gmail.com,,,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India [22/0704/15/EMR-II]","This in-vivo research work was supported by a research grant from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India [grant no. 22/0704/15/EMR-II].

Cytotoxic assays showed that CSDP boosted human stem cell proliferation over the study time compared to nacre derived powder (NDP), used as positive control. Human stem cells adopted a flattened morphology and established physical contact with CSDP, signature of a good biocompatibility.

To substantiate the ability to regenerate multi-types of tissues by the same constructs, in this study the constructs were implanted into three types of tissues or tissue defects in vivo, including subcutaneous fascia layer, and ear cartilage and eyelid tarsal plate defects. The ear cartilage and eyelid tarsal plate defects were fully regenerated 8 w post-implantation, showing a similar morphology to the corresponding native tissues. In the neo ear cartilage, abundant chondrocytes with obvious lacunas and cartilage-specific extracellular matrices (ECMs) were found.

Furthermore, expressions of the ECMs-specific genes and proteins, as well as the cell behavior modulatory factors, Sry related HMG box 9 (Sox9) and TGF-beta 1 were significantly up-regulated in the regenerated ear cartilages and eyelid tarsal plate than those in the subcutaneously implanted constructs, which were filled with fibrocytes, inflammatory cells, obvious vascularization and slight ECMs deposition.

In this study, a novel chemically-cross-linked antibacterial porcine acellular dermal matrix (pADM) scaffold was fabricated according to a two-step method. A naturally-derived oxidized chitosan oligosaccharide (OCOS) was used to cross-linked pADM (termed OCOS-pADM) to improve its physicochemical properties. Residual aldehyde groups within the OCOS-pADM were used in a redox reaction with Ag ions to produce Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) in situ. As the AgNPs were tightly adhered onto the scaffold fibrils (termed OCOS-AgNPs-pADM), this effectively functionalized scaffold with antibacterial properties. The generated AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XPS and SEM. The results of DSC, TG and enzymatic degradation demonstrated that OCOS-AgNPs-pADM possessed improved thermal stability and resistance to enzymatic degradation compared with pADM scaffolds. The kinetic experiment of the release of silver showed that silver was released in a controllable way. After introducing AgNPs into scaffolds, the OCOS-AgNPs-pADM possessed wide-spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coil and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, MU assay and CLSM showed that the scaffolds had good biocompatibility. Pieces of OCOS-AgNPs-pADM were implanted into Sprague-Dawley rats to characterize their ability to repair full-thickness skin wounds. And results showed that the OCOS-AgNPs-pADM could accelerate the wound healing process. Overall, this work contributes new insight into the chemical cross-linking and functionalization of pADM scaffolds. In addition, as novel antibacterial scaffolds, OCOS-AgNPs-pADMs have the potential for development as wound dressing materials.","[Chen, Yining; Dan, Nianhua; Dan, Weihua] Sichuan Univ, Key Lab Leather Chem & Engn, Minist Educ, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yining; Dan, Nianhua; Dan, Weihua] Sichuan Univ, Res Ctr Biomed Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinhua] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Bioresources Chem & Mat Engn, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cong, Liangliang] Jiangyin Benshine Biol Technol Co Ltd, Jiangyin 214400, Peoples R China","Dan, NH (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, Dept Biomass Chem & Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",dannianhua@scu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51473001]; Key Technology Research and Development Program of Jiangyin City [JYKJ3369],"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (contract grant number 51473001), and Key Technology Research and Development Program of Jiangyin City (contract grant number JYKJ3369).",,51,0,0,19,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

In this review, we critically describe the most representative bioengineered models for anticancer drug screening in CRC from the conventional two-dimensional models to the new-generation three-dimensional scaffold-based ones.

An animal model separating the cancellous and cortical healing was used with a combination of a macroporous gelatin-calcium sulphate-hydroxyapatite (Gel-CaS-HA) biomaterial as a cancellous defect filler, and a thin collagen membrane (CM) guiding cortical bone regeneration. The membrane was immobilized with bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) to enhance the osteoinductive properties. The Gel-CaS-HA cancellous defect filler contained both rhBMP-2 and a bisphosphonate, (zoledronate = ZA) to prevent premature callus resorption induced by the pro-osteoclast effect of rhBMP-2 alone. In the first part of the study, the CM delivering both rhBMP-2 and ZA was tested in a muscle pouch model in rats and the co-delivery of rhBMP-2 and ZA via the CM resulted in higher amounts of bone compared to rhBMP-2 alone. Secondly, an established tibia defect model in rats was used to study cortical and cancellous bone regeneration. The defect was left empty, filled with Gel-CaS-HA alone, Gel-CaS-HA immobilized with ZA or Gel-CaS-HA immobilized with rhBMP-2+ ZA. Functionalization of the Gel-CaS-HA scaffold with bioactive molecules produced significantly more bone in the cancellous defect and its surroundings but cortical defect healing was delayed likely due to the protrusion of the Gel-CaS-HA into the cortical bone. To guide cortical regeneration, the cortical defect was sealed endosteally by a CM with or without rhBMP-2. Subsequently, the cancellous defect was filled with Gel-CaS-HA containing ZA and rhBMP2 + ZA. In the groups where the CM was doped with rhBMP-2, significantly higher number of cortices bridged. The approach to guide cancellous as well as cortical bone regeneration separately in a metaphyseal defect using two bioactive molecule immobilized biomaterials is promising and could improve the clinical care of patients with metaphyseal defects.","[Raina, Deepak Bushan; Larsson, David; Isaksson, Hanna; Lidgren, Lars; Tagil, Magnus] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Orthoped, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Qayoom, Irfan; Kumar, Ashok] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Biol Sci & Bioengn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Larsson, David] Umea Univ, Fac Med, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Zheng, Ming Hao] Univ Western Australia, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Isaksson, Hanna] Lund Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, S-22100 Lund, Sweden","Raina, DB (reprint author), BMC C12, S-22184 Lund, Sweden.",deepak.raina@med.lu.se,,,"Region Skane (ALF), Sweden; VINNOVA; Swedish agency for innovation systems [2017-00269]; Swedish Research Council [2015-06717]; Department of Science and Technology, Government of India [DST/INT/SWD/P-11/2016]; Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/IN/Sweden/08/AK/2017-18]","The authors would like to thank the Medical Faculty, Lund University and Lund University Bioimaging Center (LBIC) for research infrastructure.

We present a new class of protein elastomer-dominated synthetic corneas with attractive performance that intimately couple biologically active tropoelastin to mechanically robust and durable protein silk. Fabricated films substantially replicate the natural cornea physically and by interacting with both key cells types used in cornea repair. Performance encompasses optical clarity at high transmittance, compatible refractive index, substantial glucose permeability, compliant mechanical properties, and support of both growth and function of corneal epithelial and endothelial cells.","[Aghaei-Ghareh-Bolagh, Behnaz; Mithieux, Suzanne M.; Weiss, Anthony S.] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Aghaei-Ghareh-Bolagh, Behnaz; Mithieux, Suzanne M.; Weiss, Anthony S.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Guan, Juan] Beihang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Biomed Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiwei] Univ Sydney, ANZAC Res Inst, Burns Res Grp, Concord, NSW 2139, Australia; [Martin, Adam D.] Univ New South Wales, Australian Ctr Nanomed, Dept Chem, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Martin, Adam D.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Convergent Bionano Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Dawson, Rebecca] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Weiss, Anthony S.] Univ Sydney, Bosch Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Weiss, AS (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",tony.weiss@sydney.edu.au,"Guan, Juan/B-8988-2013","Guan, Juan/0000-0002-9784-8125; Martin, Adam/0000-0002-5445-0299",NHMRC; Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51503009],"We thank Damien Harkin at QUT for his advice and expertise on the culture of epithelial cells.

Such biomaterials can enhance tissue-specific differentiation of adult stem cells, suggesting that structuring different ECMs into multi-layered scaffolds can form the basis of new strategies for regenerating damaged interfacial tissues such as the osteochondral unit. In this study, mass spectrometry is used to demonstrate that growth plate (GP) and articular cartilage (AC) ECMs contain a unique array of regulatory proteins that may be particularly suited to bone and cartilage repair respectively. Applying a novel iterative freeze-drying method, porous bi-phasic scaffolds composed of GP ECM overlaid by AC ECM are fabricated, which are capable of spatially directing stem cell differentiation in vitro, promoting the development of graded tissues transitioning from calcified cartilage to hyaline-like cartilage. Evaluating repair 12-months post-implantation into critically-sized caprine osteochondral defects reveals that these scaffolds promote regeneration in a manner distinct to commercial control-scaffolds. The GP layer supports endochondral bone formation, while the AC layer stimulates the formation of an overlying layer of hyaline cartilage with a collagen fiber architecture better recapitulating the native tissue. These findings support the use of a bi-layered, tissue-specific ECM derived scaffolds for regenerating spatially complex musculoskeletal tissues.","[Cunniffe, Grainne M.; Diaz-Payno, Pedro J.; Sheehy, Eamon J.; Critchley, Susan E.; Almeida, Henrique V.; Pitacco, Pierluca; Carroll, Simon F.; Mahon, Olwyn R.; O'Brien, Fergal J.; Kelly, Daniel J.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Biomed Sci Inst, Trinity Ctr Bioengn, Dublin, Ireland; [Cunniffe, Grainne M.; Diaz-Payno, Pedro J.; Sheehy, Eamon J.; Critchley, Susan E.; Almeida, Henrique V.; Pitacco, Pierluca; Carroll, Simon F.; Mahon, Olwyn R.; O'Brien, Fergal J.; Kelly, Daniel J.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Cunniffe, Grainne M.; Levingstone, Tanya J.; Moran, Conor J.; Brady, Robert T.; O'Brien, Fergal J.; Kelly, Daniel J.] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Adv Mat & Bioengn Res Ctr AMBER, Dublin, Ireland; [Cunniffe, Grainne M.; Levingstone, Tanya J.; Moran, Conor J.; Brady, Robert T.; O'Brien, Fergal J.; Kelly, Daniel J.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Sheehy, Eamon J.; Levingstone, Tanya J.; Moran, Conor J.; Brady, Robert T.; O'Brien, Fergal J.; Kelly, Daniel J.] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Dept Anat, Tissue Engn Res Grp, Dublin, Ireland; [Mahon, Olwyn R.; Dunne, Aisling] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Biochem & Immunol, Mol Immunol Grp, Dublin, Ireland; [Brama, Pieter A.

The result of our study shows that the nanoparticle absorber delivers a high absorbance of 90%, and enhances the electric field drastically as six times, which makes it an ideal choice for bio-sensing applications. The effect of the particle size and surface topology is investigated to maximize the absorbance of the structure and can be noticed for frequency tuning. In addition, for biosensing applications, the shift in the resonance frequency and the Figure of Merit (FOM) was studied by exposing the nanoparticles with different biomaterials. The results revealed that by concentrating the energy, we will be able to distinguish different materials with a very high accuracy. As a matter of fact, the parametric studies indicate that the suggested structure has outstanding resonance frequency stability.

In the present study, Mg-6Zn-1.2Y-0.8Nd alloy was fabricated, and then extrusion and heat treatment were conducted to optimize its mechanical properties and cytocompatibility. The microstructure observation, mechanical property, degradation behavior and cytocompatibility tests were conducted on the Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy with three different states: as-cast (alloy C), as-extruded (alloy E) and extruded + heat treated (alloy EH). The results show that alloy C consists of coarse grains and continuous secondary phases. The extrusion process has caused incomplete recrystallization, and results in a mixed grain structure of elongated grains and small equiaxed grains (alloy E). The heat treatment process has promoted the recrystallization and homogenized the grain structure (alloy EH). Both the strength and ductility of the alloy has been improved by extrusion, but the following heat treatment has decreased the strength and increased the ductility. The degradation behavior of the alloy C and E alloys does not show much difference, but improves slightly in alloy EH, because the heat treatment has homogenized the microstructure and released the residual stress in the alloy. The directly and indirectly cell viability tests indicate that alloy EH exhibits the best cytocompatibility, which should be ascribed to its relative uniform degradation and low ion releasing rate. In summary, the combination of hot extrusion and heat treatment could optimize the mechanical property and cytocompatibility of the Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy together, which is beneficial for the future application of the alloy.

The X-ray diffraction and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis data revealed that the phase and elemental composition of the deposited HA coatings were similar, but the surface roughness and morphology were influenced by the substrate bias voltage. The coating deposited at - 25 V consists of multiple grain-boundaries. In contrast, no grain boundary but rather flat surface was observed for the sample deposited at - 100 V. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to obtain topographic images of the obtained coatings and quantitative assessment of the surface roughness. The roughness parameters of the deposited coatings were found to display nanometer scale surface roughness (Sa and Sq) from 92 to 130 nm over areas of 5 x 5 mu m(2). The in vitro direct culture experiment showed that the HA coating deposited at the substrate bias of - 100 V significantly reduced the release of Mg ions in post-culture media and revealed higher BMSCs adhesion density than that on the HA coating deposited at the bias of - 25 V and the uncoated AZ91 alloy. Thus, this study demonstrated that the negative pulse substrate bias applied for HA coating deposition allows to improve the surface features of the AZ91 magnesium alloy and enhance BMSCs adhesion in vitro.","[Surmeneva, Maria A.; Ivanova, Anna A.; Surmenev, Roman A.] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Phys Mat Sci & Composite Mat Ctr, Lenin Ave 43, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Tian, Qiaomu; Pittman, Rebekah; Liu, Huinan H.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bioengn, 900 Univ Ave,MSE 227, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Jiang, Wensen; Lin, Jiajia; Liu, Huinan H.] Univ Calif Riverside, Mat Sci & Engn, 900 Univ Ave,MSE 313, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Surmenev, RA (reprint author), Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Phys Mat Sci & Composite Mat Ctr, Lenin Ave 43, Tomsk 634050, Russia.; Liu, HNH (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Mat Sci & Engn, 900 Univ Ave,MSE 313, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",Huinan.liu@ucr.edu; rsurmenev@gmail.com,,,"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [1512764, 1125801, 1545852]; U.S. Civilian Research & Development Foundation (CRDF Global); University of California (UC) Regents Faculty Development Award; Hellman Fellowship; UC-Riverside Dissertation Research Grant; Tomsk Polytechnic University","Some experimental details on cell culture studies used in Materials and methods section was reprinted from Ref.

The adsorption mechanism, interfacial interactions and conformation of the adsorbed fibrinogen (Fgn) on the HAp NP films were investigated. The Fgn adsorption behavior demonstrated the higher affinity of Fgn with the HAp NP films. At the lower temperature at 22 degrees C, Fgn was preferentially adsorbed on the gold though hydrophobic interactions with the larger Fgn adsorption amount. At the higher temperature at 37 degrees C or at the higher phosphate ion concentrations caused the structural changes of the adsorbed Fgn. Moreover, the temperature increment in PBS increased the Fgn adsorption amount with the rearrangement into the end-on orientation of the Fgn. Accordingly, HAp induced the electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding to be the stable Fgn-HAp NP film, minimizing the interactions among the water molecules. The HAp NP films with the preferentially elliptical crystalline shapes induced the Fgn steric conformation structures, and the secondary structural changes of the adsorbed Fgn by the increment of temperature were also supported by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) deconvolution results.","[Galindo, Tania Guadalupe Penaflor; Yamada, Iori; Yamada, Shota; Tagaya, Motohiro] Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, Kamitomioka 1603-1, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan","Tagaya, M (reprint author), Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, Kamitomioka 1603-1, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan.",tagaya@mst.nagaokaut.ac.jp,,,,,,72,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0254-0584,1879-3312,,MATER CHEM PHYS,Mater.

The viability of the scaffold has been shown to depend on, among other things, the microstructure. Common parameters, that are used to describe microstructure, are porosity, material thickness, pore size and surface area. These properties quantify the suitability of the scaffold as a substrate for cell adhesion, fluid exchange and nutrient transfer. Bone and cartilage scaffolds are often placed or operated under loads (predominantly compression). This can alter the structural parameters depending on the stiffness of the scaffold and applied deformation. It is important to know, how scaffolds' parameters change under deformation. In this study, two scaffolds (PLCL-TCP and collagen-PLA) intended for use in bone and cartilage applications, were studied through micro computed tomography based imaging and in situ mechanical testing. The scaffolds were subjected to uniaxial compressive deformation up to 50% of the original size. The corresponding changes in the individual scaffold bulk characteristics were analyzed. Our results show an expected decrease in porosity with increasing deformation (with PLCL-TCP scaffold 52% deformation resulted in 56% decrease in porosity). Especially in the sandwich constructs of collagen-PLA, but also in PLCL-TCP composites, it was evident that different materials are affected differently which may be of significance in applications with mechanical loading. Our results are a step towards understanding the changes in the structure of these scaffolds under loading.","[Hannula, Markus; Narra, Nathaniel; Paakinaho, Kaarlo; Haaparanta, Anne-Marie; Kellomaki, Minna; Hyttinen, Jari] Tampere Univ Technol, BioMediTech Inst, Tampere, Finland; [Hannula, Markus; Narra, Nathaniel; Paakinaho, Kaarlo; Haaparanta, Anne-Marie; Kellomaki, Minna; Hyttinen, Jari] Tampere Univ Technol, Fac Biomed Sci & Engn, Tampere, Finland; [Narra, Nathaniel] Univ Cape Town, Div Biomed Engn, Fac Hlth Sci, Cape Town, South Africa","Hannula, M (reprint author), Tampere Univ Technol, BioMediTech Inst, Tampere, Finland.; Hannula, M (reprint author), Tampere Univ Technol, Fac Biomed Sci & Engn, Tampere, Finland.",markus.hannula@tut.fi,"Hyttinen, Jari/G-4280-2014","Hyttinen, Jari/0000-0003-1850-3055",Human Spare Parts Project - Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES); South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation [98788],The work of M.

Materials and methods: A simplified homogenization technique was developed to substitute a detailed scaffold model with the same size and equivalent orthotropic material properties. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach was compared with two other common homogenization methods based on periodic boundary conditions and the Hills-energy theorem. Moreover, experimental digital image correlation (DIC) measurements of full-field surface strain were conducted to validate the numerical results. Results: The newly proposed simplified homogenization approach allowed for fairly accurate prediction of strain and total strain energy in tissue scaffolds implanted in a large femur mid-shaft bone defect subjected to a simulated in-vivo loading condition. The maximum discrepancy between the total strain energy obtained from the simplified homogenization approach and the one obtained from detailed porous scaffolds was 8.8%. Moreover, the proposed modeling technique could significantly reduce the computational cost (by about 300 times) required for simulating an in-vivo bone scaffolding scenario as the required degrees of freedom (DoF) was reduced from about 26 million for a detailed porous scaffold to only 90,000 for the homogenized solid counterpart in the analysis. Conclusions: The simplified homogenization approach has been validated by correlation with the experimental DIC measurements. It is fairly efficient and comparable with some other common homogenization techniques in terms of accuracy. The proposed method is implicating to different clinical applications, such as the optimal selection of patient-specific fixation plates and screw system.","[Entezari, Ali; Zhang, Zhongpu; Sue, Andrian; Sun, Guangyong; Chang, Che-Cheng; Swain, Michael V.; Li, Qing] Univ Sydney, Sch Aerosp Mech & Mechatron Engn, J07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Huo, Xintao] Hunan Univ, State Key Lab Adv Design & Manufacture Vehicle Bo, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shiwei] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Ctr Innovat Struct & Mat, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia","Li, Q (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Sch Aerosp Mech & Mechatron Engn, J07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",ali.entezari@sydney.edu.au; leo.zhang@sydney.edu.au; andrian.sue@sydney.edu.au; guangyong.sun@sydney.edu.au; huoxintao@hnu.edu.au; ccha8453@uni.sydney.edu.au; shiwei.zhou@rmit.edu.au; michael.swain@sydney.edu.au; qing.li@sydney.edu.au,,"Zhang, Zhongpu/0000-0002-3773-5612; zhou, shiwei/0000-0003-2566-0948; Swain, Michael/0000-0002-8801-8656","Australian Research Council (ARC), Australia [DP160104602, LP140100900]","The support from the Australian Research Council (ARC), Australia (DP160104602 and LP140100900) is acknowledged.

By applying a composition design theory, cold rolling and low temperature aging, a metastable beta-type Ti-35Nb-7Zr-5Ta (wt%) alloy with an elastic modulus of 47 GPa and a yield strength of 730 MPa was successfully fabricated. This combination of high yield strength and low elastic modulus resulted in enhanced elastic recoverable strain of 1.7%, which is much higher than that of the conventional metallic biomaterials. The microstructure responsible for the much sought-after mechanical properties was observed to be mainly consisted of a homogeneous distribution of nanometer-sized omega- and alpha-precipitates in a beta-phase matrix obtained via cold rolling plus short-time aging at low temperature, i.e. aging at 673 K for 20 min. These precipitates increase the strength of the material by hindering the motion of dislocations while the beta-matrix with relatively low content of beta-stabilizers gives rise to the observed low elastic modulus. By extending aging time, a higher strength is reached at the expense of an undesirable increasing in elastic modulus.","[Plaine, Athos Henrique; da Silva, Murillo Romero; Bolfarini, Claudemiro] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Engn Mat, Rod Washington Luis Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Plaine, AH (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Engn Mat, Rod Washington Luis Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",athosplaine@hotmail.com,,,Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP [2016/17502-7]; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES,This work was supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP [grant number 2016/17502-7]; and Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES.,,16,0,0,4,4,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

These restrictions have thus far prevented optimization of composition and structure of the in vivo tissue microenvironment. The artificial nature of currently used biomaterials affects cellular phenotype and function of the bioprinted tissues, and results in inaccurate modeling of disease and drug metabolism significantly. Collagen type I is the major structural component in the ECM, and is widely used as a 3D hydrogel, but is less applicable for 3D bioprinting due to low viscosity and slow polymerization. We have hypothesized that a combination of hyaluronic acid with collagen I yields a bioink with the properties required for extrusion bioprinting, while supporting native cell-matrix interactions and preservation of the native microenvironment properties. To test this hypothesis, we tested the viscoelastic properties of three bioink formulations-2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 collagen type I to hyaluronic acid, and examined cellular behavior in order to determine an optimal formulation that allows for bioprinting while supporting biological activity. We then employed this formulation to bioprint 3D liver tissue constructs containing primary human hepatocytes and liver stellate cells and tested the effects of acetaminophen, a common liver toxicant. Our results have shown that the combination of methacrylated collagen type I and thiolated hyaluronic acid yield a simple, printable bioink that allows for modulation that was directly related to stromal cell elongation. Further, the bioink adequately allowed for implementation as a support hydrogel for hepatocytes which were able to remain viable over two weeks and responded to drug treatment appropriately.","[Mazzocchi, Andrea; Devarasetty, Mahesh; Huntwork, Richard; Soker, Shay; Skardal, Aleksander] Wake Forest Sch Med, Wake Forest Inst Regenerat Med, 391 Technol Way, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Mazzocchi, Andrea; Soker, Shay; Skardal, Aleksander] Wake Forest Sch Med, Virginia Tech Wake Forest Sch Biomed Engn & Sci, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Soker, Shay; Skardal, Aleksander] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Soker, Shay; Skardal, Aleksander] Wake Forest Baptist Med, Comprehens Canc Ctr, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Skardal, A (reprint author), Wake Forest Sch Med, Wake Forest Inst Regenerat Med, 391 Technol Way, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA.; Skardal, A (reprint author), Wake Forest Sch Med, Virginia Tech Wake Forest Sch Biomed Engn & Sci, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.; Skardal, A (reprint author), Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.; Skardal, A (reprint author), Wake Forest Baptist Med, Comprehens Canc Ctr, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",askardal@wakehealth.edu,,,Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium [W81XWH-15-9-0001],"The authors acknowledge funding from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium under Contract#W81XWH-15-9-0001.

Synthesis of a novel cyto-compatible and biodegradable polymer composed of trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate-trimethylolpropane tris (3-mercaptopropionate) (TMPeTA-TMPTMP) using a simple amine-catalyzed Michael addition reaction is reported in this study. This study explores the impact of molecular weight and crosslink density on the cytocompatibility of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells. Eight groups were prepared with two different average molecular weights of trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate (TMPeTA 692 and 912) and four different concentrations of diethylamine (DEA) as catalyst. The materials were physically characterized by mechanical testing, wettability, mass loss, protein adsorption and surface topography. Cyto-compatibility of the polymeric substrates was evaluated by LIVE/DEAD staining (R) and DNA content assay of cultured human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) on the samples over over days. Surface topography studies revealed that TMPeTA (692) samples have island pattern features whereas TMPeTA (912) polymers showed pitted surfaces. Water contact angle results showed a significant difference between TMPeTA (692) and TMPeTA (912) monomers with the same DEA concentration. Decreased protein adsorption was observed on TMPeTA (912) -16% DEA compared to other groups. Fluorescent microscopy also showed distinct hASCs attachment behavior between TMPeTA (692) and TMPeTA (912), which is due to their different surface topography, protein adsorption and wettability. Our finding suggested that this thiol-acrylate based polymer is a versatile, cyto-compatible material for tissue engineering applications with tunable cell attachment property based on surface characteristics.","[Forghani, Anoosha; Chen, Cong; Hayes, Daniel] Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Millennium Sci Complex, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Garber, Leah; Pojman, John A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Chem, Choppin Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Tavangarian, Fariborz] Penn State Univ, Sch Sci Engn & Technol, Mech Engn Program, Middletown, PA 17057 USA; [Tighe, Timothy B.; Hayes, Daniel] Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, Mat Characterizat Lab, Millennium Sci Complex, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Devireddy, Ram] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Patrick E Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hayes, Daniel] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, Millennium Sci Complex, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Hayes, D (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Millennium Sci Complex, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Hayes, D (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, Mat Characterizat Lab, Millennium Sci Complex, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Hayes, D (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, Millennium Sci Complex, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",djh195@psu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CBET-1403301]; National Institutes of Health [RDE024790A]; NSF EPSCoR LA-SiGMA project [EPS-1003897],"Generous financial support for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation (CBET-1403301), the National Institutes of Health (RDE024790A) and NSF EPSCoR LA-SiGMA project (EPS-1003897).

Acrylate/acrylamide copolymers have excellent optical properties and biocompatibility and are ideal biomaterials that have been widely used in tissue engineering. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cells (Muse cells) are a specific subset of mesenchymal stem cells that have an excellent potential for the regenerative medicine. Objective. This study was designed to investigate the effects of acrylate/acrylamide copolymers on the adhesion, proliferation and pluripotent-like properties of Muse cells, which were derived from normal human dermal fibroblasts by long-term trypsin incubation. Methods. In an initial experiment, Muse cells were seeded on primary microarrays containing micro-spots of 275 different mixtures of acrylate/acrylamide. Each mixture was composed of two of 11 different monomers in various proportions, and was replicated in four micro-spots each. According to the adhesion and growth characteristics of Muse cells on those substrates, specific polymer candidates for Muse cells were selected and secondary microarrays were prepared. We then observed the effects of those specific polymer candidates on the adherence, proliferation and differentiation of Muse cells and suitable candidates for their optimal culture were identified. Results. According to the adhesion and growth patterns of Muse cells on the primary microarrays, ten suitable mixtures of acrylate/acrylamide copolymers were identified. Muse cells grew well on six of those combinations and around the four other combinations of those polymer mixtures. Muse cells cultured on three of those combinations proliferated and differentiated into long spindle-shaped cells that looked like fibroblasts, while Muse cells cultured on one combination formed clusters that were ring-shaped. Muse cells cultured on some of those combinations of acrylate/acrylamide proliferated and formed clusters that appeared to be very healthy, whereas Muse cells cultured on other combinations formed clusters that expanded outwards. Conclusions. These results identified a polymer combination that was optimum for the adhesion, proliferation and maintenance of Muse cells in an undifferentiated state.","[Wang, Li; Xiao, Li; Zhang, Ru-zhi; Shi, Hai-xia] Soochow Univ, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, Affiliated Hosp 3, Changzhou 213000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Li] Bengbu Med Coll, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Bengbu 233000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Lin-zi; Zhang, Rong] Changzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Changzhou 213164, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rong] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Chem, EaStCHEM, Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JJ, Midlothian, Scotland","Zhang, RZ (reprint author), Soochow Univ, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, Affiliated Hosp 3, Changzhou 213000, Peoples R China.",shangruzhi628@163.com,,,Clinical Medical Science and Technology Project of Jiangsu [BL2014036],The authors are very grateful to Professor Elizabeth Hearing for help with the English-language editing.

Herein, the high carbohydrate-content biomaterials, shaddock peels (SP), were used as the bio-host for supporting the bimetallic oxides, zirconium (Zr) and lanthanum (La) hydroxides, forming the SP-Zr-La composites. Phosphate adsorption properties as well as stability of the novel composites were evaluated. The SP-Zr-La composites indicated that some rod-like or amorphous nanoparticles with sizes of 20-150 nm were anchored inside the SP, which exerted more available interface interactions toward the adsorbed ions. The Zr-La species were pH-sensitive and adsorption capacity of phosphate by SP-Zr-La was increased with the rise in temperature. As the molar ratio of accompanying ions/phosphate was increased from 0 to 10 times, the SP-Zr-La was observed with the adsorption loss of 27.2-36.7%. Whereas the adsorption loss of cationic SP (grafted with quaternary ammonium groups) was calculated up to 86.2-91.6%; this indicated the more feasibility of SP-Zr-La in real applications. In addition, the stability of impregnated Zr and La species in SP-Zr-La was greatly improved by the bio-carrier through the ""shielding effect"" in a low HA surrounding. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It has become increasingly common to derivatize chitosan to produce nitric oxide (NO)-releasing materials that exert various therapeutic effects through the action of NO. It is generally the case that these NO-releasing polymers are prepared by exposure to high-pressure NO or nitrosating agents like nitrous acid (HNO2) or alkyl nitrites (RONO). In our study, mass spectrometry and spectroscopic methods demonstrate that both monomeric and oligomeric glucosamine experience chemical alteration after exposure to HNO2-based nitrosating conditions from the literature. In polymeric chitosan, HNO2-based nitrosating conditions were found to induce degradation through the formation of 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose and oligosaccharides. In contrast, the RONO tert-butyl nitrite and high-pressure NO were not found to significantly degrade or otherwise alter the structure of glucosamine or its oligomers, supporting the suitability of these approaches.","[Allison, Christopher L.; Reynolds, Melissa M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, 1801 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Lutzke, Alec; Reynolds, Melissa M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, 1370 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Reynolds, Melissa M.] Colorado State Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, 1376 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Reynolds, MM (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, 1801 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Chris.Allison@colostate.edu; Alec.Lutzke@colostate.edu; Melissa.Reynolds@colostate.edu,,,Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University; Monfort Foundation; National Institute of Health [1R21EB016838-021],"This work was supported by the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University, The Monfort Foundation, and The National Institute of Health [1R21EB016838-021].",,36,0,0,15,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8617,1879-1344,,CARBOHYD POLYM,Carbohydr.

The coefficients of clusters were designed by mixing entropy. Only four compositions were designed. Among those, alloy with highest GFA was achieved at the composition of Zr53.6Al18.6Co27.8 which enjoyed the same glass forming ability (GFA) as the well-known Zr86Al16Co28 under the same condition. A series of compositions minor alloyed by Nb were further designed and analyzed. The results show that the optimum addition content of Nb could further enhance the GFA.

But neural tissues withstand constant mechanical activity with outside devices which aggravates inflammation response. The investigation about soft interfacial modification materials for neural implants is a promising way to reduce the mechanical mismatch of neural tissues and implants. In this study, soft alginic acid gel and poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfate)(PEDOT/PSS) coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT) was co-deposited on a microwire neural electrode, then PEDOT/PSS was electrochemically grown through the coating material to form a kind of soft interpenetrating networks (IPNs) for the improvement of neural interface. Compared to unmodified electrodes, the modified electrodes possess higher charge storage capacity (CSC) and lower electrochemical impedance, which would benefit the performance of stimulating and recording respectively. The IPNs are very soft after reswelling in brain tissue, and the cell experiment indicate its fantastic biocompatibility. Furthermore, acute neural recording experiments revealed that the IPNs reduced the noise floor. All these characteristics are greatly desired for the neural interface. Overall, we developed a soft interpenetrating conducting hydrogel coating material on the neural interface with excellent electrical and biological performance.

The microstructures and elemental composition of YBCO nano-particle deposited on graphene sheet by the MAPLE process were studied as a function of the irradiation time (t). The amount of YBCO nanoparticles deposited on graphene is increased with increasing t. The average particle size of the spherical YBCO nanoparticles deposited on graphene sheets is decreased from 70 +/- 25 nm to 50 +/- 15 nm when t increases from 0.5 h to 2.0 h.

Alginates and fucoidans are two of the most renowned biopolymers from marine brown algae with numerous potential applications in engineering and biomedical science due to their desirable physicochemical characteristics and biofunctional properties. Alginates are particularly attractive for its biocompatibility and hydro jelling properties while fucoidans are famous for its broad range of bioactive effects attributed to their sulfate substitution. Structurally modified alginates have shown functional properties different to their native state which is suitable for a variety of potential applications in tissue engineering, wound healing, drug delivery and as fillers and viscosity controlling agents while enhanced biofunctional properties are achieved via structurally modified fucoidans. The present review encloses a comprehensive overview of recent developments in alginates and fucoidans derivatization methods such as controlled degradation, cross-linking, oxidation, substitution of different functional groups and co-polymerizing techniques.

As compared to PSP, DPSP exhibited superior reinforcing and toughening effects on PP, due to the ameliorated filler-polymer interfacial interaction. The optimal additive amount of DPSP was determined as 10 wt %, under which the tensile strength of PP was raised from 33.17 to 35.37 MPa, flexural strength from 41.16 to 44.35 MPa, and impact strength from 3.77 to 5.98 kJ/m(2).

A series of poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/PEG and PLA/PEG/HNT composites were fabricated using a twin-screw extruder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the hybrid between PEG and HNTs had no evident chemical interaction via supersonic vibration and dynamic vacuuming. The dispersed morphology of the compounding modifier in the PLA matrix was tested by high-resolution scanning electronic microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the low content of PEG/HNTs presented a good dispersion morphology. The binding energy of the PLA-based composites was studied through contact angle measurements. The results showed that PEG and PEG/HNTs can decrease the water contact angle of PLA, and that the binding energy between PEG and HNTs is higher than that of PLA/HNTs, which leads to more location of HNTs in the PEG phase. The crystallization behavior of PLA-based composites was examined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The results suggested that the addition of PEG and PEG/HNTs effectively enhanced the crystallization of PLA and that the diffraction peak intensity of the PLA-based composites reached a maximum when the content of PEG/HNTs was 1.2 wt %. The spherulite morphology indicated that the addition of PEG resulted in perfect spherulites. The mechanical properties of PLA-based composites were analyzed with a universal testing machine and impact tester, which confirmed that the tensile strength and impact strength of the PLA-based composites increased slightly when the content of the PEG/HNT modifier was 1.2 wt %, while the tensile modulus of the PLA-based composites increased distinctly.

Therefore, the connection of excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity of ZrO2 ceramics with good properties of titanium is considered to be a promising approach for the fabrication of more perfect hard tissue replacement implants. This study describes the formation of Ti-ZrO2 nanostructure composite biomaterial. Weighted amounts with the composition corresponding to Ti-xZrO(2) (x = 10, 30 and 50 wt.%) were high energy milled in the planetary ball mill PULVERISETTE 7 premium line by Fritch at 10, 30 and 50 h milling times.

The Rietveld method was applied for the verification of the qualitative and quantitative phase composition of the studied material. The parameters of diffraction line profiles were determined by PRO-FIT Toraya procedure. The crystallite sizes and lattice distortions were analyzed by Williamson-Hall method. It was found that during high-energy milling a significant decrease of crystallite size to nanoscale is observed for alpha-Ti and mZrO(2) phases. The images from scanning and transmission electron microscopes of the milled powders show that the size of the agglomerates of Ti nanocrystallites changes in a broad range and that ZrO2 particles can be immersed in larger agglomerates or occur separately.","[Dercz, Grzegorz; Matula, Izabela; Zubko, Maciej; Kuczera, Natalia] Univ Silesia Katowice, Inst Mat Sci, PL-41500 Chorzow, Poland","Dercz, G (reprint author), Univ Silesia Katowice, Inst Mat Sci, PL-41500 Chorzow, Poland.",,,,Polish National Science Centre (Polish: Narodowe Centrum Nauki); (NCN) [UMO-2011/03/D/ST8/04884],"This work was supported by the Polish National Science Centre (Polish: Narodowe Centrum Nauki, abbr.

In order to enhance the miscibility between the green polyolefin and the biopolyester, different reactive compatibilizers were added during the melt-blending process, namely polyethylene-grafted maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), poly(ethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PE-co-GMA), maleinized linseed oil (MLO), and a combination of MLO with dicumyl peroxide (DCP). Among the tested compatibilizers, the dual addition of MLO and DCP provided the binary blend pieces with the most balanced mechanical performance in terms of rigidity and impact strength as well as the highest thermal stability. The fracture surface of the binary blend piece processed with MLO and DCP revealed the formation of a continuous structure in which the dispersed PLA phase was nearly no discerned in the bio-HDPE matrix. The resultant miscibility improvement was ascribed to both the high solubility and plasticizing effect of MLO on the PLA phase as well as the crosslinking effect of DCP on both biopolymers. The latter effect was particularly related to the formation of macroradicals of each biopolymer that, thereafter, led to the in situ formation of bio-HDPE-co-PLA copolymers and also to the development of a partially crosslinked network in the binary blend. As a result, cost-effective and fully bio-based polymer pieces with improved mechanical strength, high toughness, and enhanced thermal resistance were obtained. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

As this precursor also naturally contains a significant amount of silica, a composite containing cellulose fibers mixed with amorphous silica particles (with rosette-like shape) was also produced. Finally, the possibility of synthesis of cellulose acetate was also demonstrated, illustrating the plethora of potential applications of this important lignocellulosic residue for the production of cellulose-based materials of high technological interest.","[Amaral, Heliane R.; Cipriano, Daniel F.; Santos, Mayara S.; Schettino Jr, Miguel A.; Cunha, Alfredo G.; Emmerich, Francisco G.; Freitas, Jair C.

Therefore, it is important to know how the corrosion of a metal device implanted in the human body causes clinically significant problems and it is necessary to develop an in vivo method to examine the condition of the implant. Raman spectroscopy offers the possibility of inserting a Raman probe into the vicinity of the implant to determine the surface condition of the implant and the content of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the surrounding area. For this purpose, trace elements in human body fluids; e. g., peptides, can be used. For the above reasons, in this work the surfaces of Ti plate and TiO2 (anatase and ruffle) nanostructures (TiO(2)NPs) were characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies as well as scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). These metal surfaces were used as highly sensitive, uniform, and reproducible sensors of the natural ligand (bombesin, BN) of some types of metabotropic seven transmembrane G protein-coupled superfamily receptors (GPCRs), which are over-express on the surface of many malignant tumors and are present in human body fluids. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was used to monitor the geometry of adsorbate, to separate, enrich, and detect a variety of BN fragments in a physiological environment and to determine the type of surface (Ti vs TiO2). Our work extends the use of SEAS to monitor the implant surface and the presence of titanium oxide in the surrounding environment as well as the use of Ti/TiO(2)NPs as potential receptor-positive cancer markers or the use of peptides to inhibit the photocatalitic properties of anatase TiO(2)NPs.","[Tata, Agnieszka; Proniewicz, Edyta] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Foundry Engn, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Szkudlarek, Aleksandra] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Acad Ctr Mat & Nanotechnol, PL-30055 Krakow, Poland; [Pacek, Joanna; Molenda, Marcin] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Gronostajowa 2, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland","Proniewicz, E (reprint author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Foundry Engn, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",proniewi@agh.edu.pl,,,National Science Center in Poland [2016/21/B/ST4/02135],This work was supported by National Science Center in Poland (Grant No. 2016/21/B/ST4/02135 to E.

The effects of these scaffolds on the production of inflammatory cytokines by human macrophage-like cells (U937) was profiled in vitro after 1 and 3 days and in subcutaneous tissues of rats after 4 and 30 days, using PCR and Multiplex arrays. Tissue culture plates (TCP) and gelatin scaffolds served as controls in vitro and in vivo respectively. After 3 days in vitro, there was no significant difference between the effects of CNF scaffolds and TCP on the production of chemokines/growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. At day 4 in vivo there was significantly higher gene expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra in the CNF scaffolds than the gelatin scaffold. Production of IL-1 beta, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha CXCL-1 and M-CSF was significantly less than in the gelatin, demonstrating an early mild inflammatory response. At day 30, both CNF scaffolds significantly stimulated the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Unlike gelatin, neither CNF scaffold had degraded 180 days post-implantation. The slow degradation of CNF scaffolds resulted in a foreign body reaction, with high production of IL-1 beta, IL-2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, M-CSF, VEGF cytokines and expression of MMP-9 gene. The surface chemistry of the CNF scaffolds elicited a modest effect on cytokine production and did not shift the inflammatory profile in vitro or in vivo. The decisive role in development of the foreign body reaction was the slow degradation of the CNF scaffolds.","[Rashad, Ahmad; Suliman, Salwa; Pedersen, Torbjorn O.; Mustafa, Kamal] Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Dent, Bergen, Norway; [Mustafa, Manal] Oral Hlth Ctr Expertise Western Norway, Bergen, Norway; [Campodoni, Elisabetta; Sandri, Monica] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Sci & Technol Ceram, Faenza, Italy; [Syverud, Kristin] RISE PFI, Trondheim, Norway; [Syverud, Kristin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Trondheim, Norway","Rashad, A; Mustafa, K (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Dent, Bergen, Norway.",Ahmad.Elsebahy@uib.no; Kamal.Mustafa@uib.no,,"Syverud, Kristin/0000-0003-2271-3637","Research Council of Norway through the NORCEL project [228147]; Bergen Research Foundation [BFS2018TMT10]; Helse Vest projects [502027, 912048]","This work has been funded by the Research Council of Norway through the NORCEL project, (Grant no. 228147), Bergen Research Foundation (BFS2018TMT10) and Helse Vest projects 502027 and 912048.

In the present study, we have fabricated Silk Fibroin (SF) modified hybrid acellular goat-dermal matrix (SF-AGDM) by modifying the AGDM in different concentration SF 5, 10, 15%, for enhancing the wound healing process. The grafts (AGDM and SF-AGDM) were evaluated for skin tissue regeneration by subjecting it through physical, chemical and biological characterization. SLS analysis showed the molecular weight of SF was 10,000 Da. Here, we found that SF-AGDM modified with low concentration of SF showed good porosity 78.56 +/- 14.30% and pore size 74.69 +/- 28.66 pm as similar to the AGDM. FTIR analysis showed the shifting of N-H stretching (3400-3600 cm-I), amide I band at 3427 cm(-1) and 1641 cm(-1) and disappearance of the peaks of CH asymmetrical stretching (3000-2800 cm(-1)), amide II and amide III band, which indicate formation of amide linkage or other interaction between the SF protein and AGDM. In vitro cell culture studies by seeding 3 T3 mouse fibroblast cells on the scaffold revealed excellent cell viability, proliferation rate and adhesion in the scaffold. Pre-clinical study done in albino mice model showed within 14 days, all the wounds were completely cured, full thickness skin was regenerated without any significant inflammatory response. SF-ADGM results better healing as compared to the unmodified AGDM, which indicates the synergetic effect of SF coupled with acellular ECM based matrix. Thus, SF-AGDM is biocompatible, cost-effective material that can be potentially applied for tissue engineering application.","[Dhasmana, Archna; Mishra, Narayan Chandra] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Polymer & Proc Engn, Uttarakhand 247667, India; [Singh, Lubhan] Swami Vivekanand Subharti Univ, Kharvel Subherti Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, Meerut 250005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Roy, Partha] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Biotechnol, Uttarakhand 247667, India","Dhasmana, A (reprint author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Polymer & Proc Engn, Uttarakhand 247667, India.",archidpt@iitr.ac.in,,,"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee; Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of India","The financial assistance for this work by Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of India, is gratefully acknowledged.",,93,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

Silk powders are obtained from Bombyx mori and Eri silk waste fibers before the degumming process. The powders are fabricated into resins via simple hot pressing under a pressure of 31.2 MPa at temperatures in the range 150-180 degrees C. The results indicate that the B. mori resins have higher micro-Vickers hardness, three-point bending strength, and elastic modulus (66 Hv, 122 MPa, and 8.7 GPa, respectively) compared to the Eri silk resins (58 Hv, 95 MPa, and 8.2 GPa, respectively). The better mechanical properties of the fibroin resins are related directly to longer drying times. The optimum drying conditions are found to be at a temperature of 100 degrees C under a vacuum of -0.1 MPa for a time of 7 d. ATR-FTIR and XRD results show how the fibroin structure changes after resinification and drying. The morphology and the distribution size of particle of the silk powders and the fractured surfaces of the resins are analyzed from SEM micrographs.

However, most of the actual products available in the market are incapable of inhibiting bacterial colonization, which can lead to tissue infection and possible implant failure. Some bone substitutes are combined with antibiotics to avoid the development of implant-associated infections, but the growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics often makes these products ineffective. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop new and alternative approaches. In the present work, a granular bone substitute of hydroxyapatite was produced, where different percentages of magnesium oxide were introduced. The antibacterial activity and biofilm formation was evaluated towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The inclusion of magnesium oxide particles reduced bacterial growth and biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner, when compared with pure hydroxyapatite materials. Superior antibacterial activity and inhibition of biofilm formation was observed for Staphylococcus aureus with complete eradication when magnesium oxide percentages were equal or above 3 wt%. The materials cytotoxicity was assessed under ISO 10993-5:2009 guidance and through Live/Dead cell marking and none of the produced granules was cytotoxic. In addition, reactive oxygen species production was also evaluated and the results revealed that the exposure to the materials extracts did not induce the formation of reactive oxygen species by cells.","[Coelho, Catarina C.; Araujo, Rita; Sousa, Susana R.; Monteiro, Fernando J.] Univ Porto, I3S Inst Invest & Inovacao Saude, Rua Alfredo Allen 208, P-4200135 Porto, Portugal; [Coelho, Catarina C.; Araujo, Rita; Sousa, Susana R.; Monteiro, Fernando J.] Univ Porto, INEB Inst Engn Biomed INEB, Rua Alfredo Allen 208, P-4200135 Porto, Portugal; [Coelho, Catarina C.; Monteiro, Fernando J.] Univ Porto, FEUP Fac Engn Univ Porto, Rua Dr Roberto Arias S-N, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Coelho, Catarina C.; Quadros, Paulo A.] FLUIDINOVA SA, Rua Engenheiro Frederico Ulrich 2650, P-4470605 Moreira Da Maia, Portugal; [Sousa, Susana R.] Inst Politecn Porto, ISEP Inst Super Engn Porto, Rua Dr Antonio Bernardino de Almeida 431, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal","Coelho, CC (reprint author), Univ Porto, I3S Inst Invest & Inovacao Saude, Rua Alfredo Allen 208, P-4200135 Porto, Portugal.",catarina.coelho@i3s.up.pt,,,"Norte Portugal Regional Operational Program (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000012, NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-017905]; FEDER -Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional funds through the COMPETE 2020 -Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalization (POCI), PORTUGAL 2020; Portuguese funds through FCT/MCTES [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007274]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BDE/108971/2015]","The authors acknowledge project Biotherapies (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000012) and NoMIC2Bone (NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-017905), supported by Norte Portugal Regional Operational Program (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

Electrospinning is widely studied as a method capable of producing nanofibers which enables cell attachment and proliferation, generating a functional scaffold that is suitable for many types of organs or tissues. In this study, electrospinning was used to obtain core-shell and monolithic fibers from the biocompatible poly (lactic acid) and poly (vinyl alcohol) polymers. The main purpose of this work is to produce core-shell nanofiber based scaffolds that works as a sustained delivery vehicle for BMP-2 protein, allowing those fibers to be used in the recovery of alveolar bone tissue without further bone surgery. Then, polymer nanofibers were manufactured by optimizing process parameters of coaxial electrospinning with emphasis on the most relevant ones: voltage, internal and external flows in an attempt to correlate fibers properties with protein releasing abilities. All nanofibers were characterized according to its morphology, thermal behaviour, crystallinity and release profile. For the release tests, bovine albumin was added into internal fiber for future periodontal restorage application. Obtained results demonstrate that fibers were formed with diameters up to 250 nm. According to electronic microscopy images, one could observe surface of nanofibers, thickness and core-shell morphology confirmed. X-ray diffraction analysis and contact angle tests showed fibers with low crystal degree and low hydrophobicity.

Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) direct-printing technique is a one-step on demand fiber deposition method which enables precise micron-scaled topographic and structural enhancement during material fabrication. In this study, core-sheath composite fibers comprising polycaprolactone, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and the drug tetracycline hydrochloride were prepared using the coaxial format of EHD direct-printing. Once positioned and aligned; multi-stacked fibers gave rise to patches. Coaxial fiber (diameter range similar to 13-25 mu m) optimization (deposition and integrity) involved parameter-structure (e.g. collector speed, flow rate, working distance and applied voltage) impact analysis. Water contact angle measurements, tensile testing and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze core-sheath integrated patches.

With increasing demand of bone bioengineering in tissue transplant, there is a need to source for sustainable solutions to induce bone regeneration. Polymeric biomaterials have been identified as a promising approach due to its excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. Specifically, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is one of the most commonly investigated polymer for use in bio-related application due to its bioinertness and versatility. Furthermore, the hydrophilic nature enables it to be incorporated with hydrophobic but biodegradable polymers like, polylactide (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), to create an amphiphilic polymer. This article reviews the recent synthetic strategies available for the construction of PEG conjugated polymeric system, analysis of PEG influence on the material properties, and provides an overview of its application in bone engineering.","[Wang, Jiang-Ze; Ding, Zhen-Qi; Ye, Wen-Bin] Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Southeast Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Orthopaed Ctr,PLA,Hosp 175, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian, Peoples R China; [You, Ming-Liang] Firestone Res Inst, Dept Med, 482 Qiaomo Rd, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Wang, JZ; Ding, ZQ (reprint author), Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Southeast Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Orthopaed Ctr,PLA,Hosp 175, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian, Peoples R China.",wangjz1123@gmail.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [81371951(H0605)]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [81401783],We thank the grants support from The Natural Science Foundation of China (81371951(H0605)) and The National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (81401783).,,120,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

Nevertheless, the use of TEPs needs much more understanding of biointeractions between biomaterials and eukaryotic cells. Despite the possibility of the use of in vitro cellular models for initial evaluation of the host response to the implanted biomaterial, it is observed that most researchers use cell cultures only for the evaluation of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation on the biomaterial surface, and then they proceed to animal models and in vivo testing of bone implants without fully utilizing the scientific potential of in vitro models. In this review, the most important biointeractions between eukaryotic cells and biomaterials were discussed, indicating molecular mechanisms of cell adhesion, proliferation, and biomaterial-induced activation of immune cells. The article also describes types of cellular models which are commonly used for biomaterial testing and highlights the possibilities and drawbacks of in vitro tests for biocompatibility evaluation of novel scaffolds. Finally, the review summarizes recent findings concerning the use of adult mesenchymal stem cells for TEP generation and compares the potential of bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived stem cells in regenerative medicine applications.","[Przekora, Agata] Med Univ Lublin, Chair & Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, Chodzki 1 St, PL-20093 Lublin, Poland","Przekora, A (reprint author), Med Univ Lublin, Chair & Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, Chodzki 1 St, PL-20093 Lublin, Poland.",agata.przekora@umlub.pl,,"Przekora-Kusmierz, Agata/0000-0002-6076-1309",,,,195,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

A combination of milling and sintering processing parameters was established by statistical analysis to optimize the microstructural and mechanical properties of BHAp/BG ceramics. The optimized sintering temperature obtained with simultaneous responses was 1220 degrees C. Variations in BHAp/BG ratios lead to isothermal phase transformation to single crystalline phases, where 85/15 and 70/30 vol:vol ratios transformed to SC and Nagel, respectively. Finally, the proposed methodology allows a feasible composition control depending only of BHAp/BG ratio to obtain non-stoichiometric SC and Nagel phases with potential applications in bone repair.","[Andrea Rincon-Lopez, July; Andrea Hermann-Munoz, Jennifer; Andres Fernandez-Benavides, David; Munoz-Saldana, Juan] IPN, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Unidad Queretaro, Libramiento Norponiente 2000, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Lorena Giraldo-Betancur, Astrid] IPN, CONACyT Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Unidad Queretaro, Libramiento Norponiente 2000, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Manuel Alvarado-Orozco, Juan] Ctr Ingn & Desarrollo Ind, Av Playa Pie de la Cuesta 702, Desarrollo San Pablo 76125, Queretaro, Mexico","Munoz-Saldana, J (reprint author), IPN, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Unidad Queretaro, Libramiento Norponiente 2000, Queretaro 76230, Mexico.",jmunoz@cinvestav.mx,,,"CONACYT [272095, 279738, 293429]","The authors thank CONACYT for the financial support.

SEM, XRD, HRTEM, FLIR, Raman and BET results demonstrated that carbonized lotus leaf became hydrophilic. In the evaporation process under a lamp illumination, the mass changed as high as 3.10 kg/(m(2)h), and the temperature increased to 60.1 degrees C.

However, newberyite has received lesser attention compare with other magnesium phosphate materials. Nonaqueous synthetic routes to oxide and phosphate materials provide certain advantages, such as a better control of nucleation and crystal growth and higher crystallinity at low temperature. To the best of our knowledge, newberyite synthesized in nonaqueous system has no relevant literature record. Therefore, we report a new method to synthesis newberyite, using MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O as magnesium source and H3PO4 as phosphorous source in nonaqueous system.

In this study, we developed a PCL-based scaffold with uniaxially aligned surface topography by stretching a 3D-printed scaffold. We examined the formation of aligned patterns by stretching the samples at different temperatures and stretching rates. This was possible through the effects of crystalline and amorphous regions on micro-textured deformation during the stretching process. We characterized the physical and biological properties of unstretched and stretched PCL struts. The stretched PCL showed greater surface roughness, protein absorption ability, and wettability. Moreover, myoblasts were cultured on the stretched and unstretched samples to analyze cellular activity. The cells cultured on the stretched samples were aligned along the pattern and showed a more elongated morphology. Furthermore, proliferation and differentiation were increased on the stretched samples resulting in a greater number of myotubes.

Hence, the main concentration of this review is on the protein adsorption and subsequently cell responses to alumina's surface, which has a wide range biomedical applications, especially in dentistry and orthopedic applications. In the presented review article, the general principles of foreign body response mechanisms, and also the role of adsorbed proteins as key players in starting interactions between cells and alumina-based biomaterials will be discussed in detail. In addition, the essential physicochemical, and mechanical properties of alumina surfaces which significantly impact on proteins and cells responses as well as the recent studies that have focused on the biocompatibility of alumina will be given. An in depth understanding of how the immune system interacts with the surface of alumina could prove the pivotal importance of the biocompatibility of alumina on its success in tissue engineering after implantation in body.","[Rahmati, Maryam; Mozafari, Masoud] MERC, Dept Nanotechnol & Adv Mat, Bioengn Res Grp, Tehran 141554777, Iran; [Rahmati, Maryam; Mozafari, Masoud] Iran Univ Med Sci, Cellular & Mol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Mozafari, Masoud] Iran Univ Med Sci, Fac Adv Technol Med, Dept Tissue Engn & Regenerat Med, Tehran, Iran","Mozafari, M (reprint author), MERC, Dept Nanotechnol & Adv Mat, Bioengn Res Grp, Tehran 141554777, Iran.",mozafari.masoud@gmail.com,,,,,,122,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9541,1097-4652,,J CELL PHYSIOL,J.

Tumors that are engineered using biomaterials are more physiologically relevant than a two-dimensional (2D) cell culture system. Matrix metalloproteinases and the plasminogen activator generated by tumor cells regulate a tumor's invasive behavior. In this study, microtumors were fabricated by encapsulating U87 glioma cells in Type I collagen and then glioma cell migration in the collagen hydrogels was investigated. Crosslinking of collagen with 8S-StarPEG increased the hydrogel viscosity and reduced the tumor cell migration speed in the hydrogels. The higher migration speed corresponded to the increased gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in glioma cells grown in non-crosslinked collagen hydrogels. Inhibitors of these molecules hindered U87 and A172 cell migration in collagen hydrogels. Aprotinin and tranexamic acid did not inhibit U87 and A172 migration on the culture dish. This study demonstrated the differential effect of pharmacologic molecules on tumor cell motility in either a 2D or three-dimensional culture environment.","[Kaphle, Pranita; Li, Yongchao; Yao, Li] Wichita State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fairmount 1845, Wichita, KS 67260 USA","Yao, L (reprint author), Wichita State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fairmount 1845, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",li.yao@wichita.edu,,,National Institute of General Medical Sciences [P20 GM103418]; Wichita State University; Wichita Medical Research and Education Foundation (WMREF); Flossie E.

The transitions of nonaccelerating nodes, during thermal degradation, due to binderless briquetting stresses on rice straw were studied and critically discussed. Intrinsic biopolymeric transformations of rice straw due to binderless briquetting stresses were analysed using thermogravimetry and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. The non accelerating nodes in briquetted biofuel shifted towards higher temperature in lignin-related region showing that lignin became less reactive in briquetted biofuel. A pattern similar to the sine wave function was noticed in the tail end segment of the acceleration profile of thermal degradation. This function was at a phase-lag of 180 in briquetted biofuel as compared to the raw material. In briquetted biofuel, fluctuations in degradation rate for lignin region subsided revealing consistent and consolidated lignin configuration. The FTIR-node at 1325.06 cm(-1) related to characteristic group vibrations of C-O (lignin) emerged in briquetted biofuel. Reduction in energy, related to OH-stretching, CH-bending, C-O stretching was observed due to briquetting stresses. Due to briquetting stresses, the vibrational energy of CH-stretching, lignin-related C = O vibration, and vibrations of lignin-related benzene ring, increased. The energy-related to Si-O-Si FTIR node drastically reduced due to briquetting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, current liver-on-a-chip technologies are labor-intensive, lack extracellular matrix (ECM) essential for liver cells, and lack a biliary system essential for excreting bile acids, which contribute to intestinal digestion but are known to be toxic to hepatocytes. Therefore, fabrication methods for development of liver-on-a-chip models that overcome the above limitations are required. Cell-printing technology enables construction of complex 3D structures with multiple cell types and biomaterials. Weused cell-printing to develop a 3D liver-on-a-chip with multiple cell types for co-culture of liver cells, liver decellularizedECMbioink for a 3D microenvironment, and vascular/biliary fluidic channels for creating vascular and biliary systems. A chip with a biliary fluidic channel induced better biliary system creation and liver-specific gene expression and functions compared to a chip without a biliary system. Further, the 3D liver-on-a-chip showed better functionalities than 2D or 3D cultures. The chip was evaluated using acetaminophen and it showed an effective drug response. In summary, our results demonstrate that the 3D liver-on-a-chip we developed is promising in vitro liver test platform for drug discovery.","[Lee, Hyungseok; Chae, Suhun; Kim, Jongmin; Cho, Dong-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Mech Engn, San 31,Hyoja Dong, Pohang 790784, Gyungbuk, South Korea; [Kim, Jae Yun] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Sch Interdisciplinary Biosci & Bioengn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, Kyungbuk, South Korea; [Han, Wonil; Choi, Yeongjin] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Integrat Biosci & Biotechnol, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea","Cho, DW (reprint author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Mech Engn, San 31,Hyoja Dong, Pohang 790784, Gyungbuk, South Korea.",dwcho@postech.ac.kr,,"Choi, Yeong-Jin/0000-0002-5211-8436",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP) [2010-0018294],This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (No. 2010-0018294).,,55,0,0,20,20,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1758-5082,1758-5090,,BIOFABRICATION,Biofabrication,APR,2019,11,2,,,,,,,025001,10.1088/1758-5090/aaf9fa,,,,12,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,HH9PI,WOS:000456070500001,30566930.0,,,,2019-02-25

In this study, a polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) porous scaffold was prepared by the process of phase inversion, then the surface of the scaffold was modified by polydopamine (PDA) as a substrate, followed by adsorption of nerve growth factor (NGF) to obtain a PDA-PLGA/NGF scaffold. The characterization and hydrophilicity of the scaffolds were evaluated by electron microscopy, EDX and contact angle measurement. The effect of PDA modification on the binding efficiency and release profile of NGF was observed by ELISA. The proliferation and differentiation of NSCs on the surface of biomaterials was evaluated by MTT, immunofluorescence staining and PCR. Subsequently, the rat T9 spinal cord transection model was established and the nerve scaffolds were implanted to injured site. Our results showed PDA modification could significantly improve the NGF adsorption capacity and provide sustained release of NGF. PDA-PLGA/NGF scaffolds could not only enhance NSCs proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro, but also promote recovery of spinal cord injury in vivo.

Despite the limitations in their applications, many studies have validated the effectiveness of using organic or inorganic fillers to ameliorate their mechanical and barrier properties. However, the understanding of how polysaccharides matrix is enhanced by fillers is still inexplicit. Hence, it is imperative to review the effects of using inorganic and organic fillers in some prominent polysaccharides in terms of mechanical and water barrier properties while taking into account the function of filler morphology, size and loading. Although it is intricate to indicate the best filler used for each of the polysaccharides matrices, this review served as a ""food for thought"" on the established works of enhanced-matrix filler combinations aimed at improving the mechanical and barrier properties of biodegradable films based on neutral or negatively charged polysaccharides-based composite films for potential application in food packaging, agriculture, biomedicine and constructions sector.

In this investigation, several porous hydrogels were prepared from mixtures of chitosan and xyloglucan. To characterize these biomaterials, their mechanical, hydrophilic, structural, and morphological properties were measured, as well as their biodegradability and antimicrobial activity. The pore sizes of the porous hydrogels were 32.8-101.6 mu m, and their water retention capacity is proportional to the added amount of xyloglucan. Dynamic degradation of the porous hydrogels with lysozymes showed progressive weight loss during the 14 days of testing. The mechanical properties improved slightly after the addition of xyloglucan. All of these results indicate that the incorporation of vegetable-derived polymers such as xyloglucan improves the properties of chitosan without affecting its antimicrobial capacity. Thus, biomaterials based on chitosan and xyloglucan are a promising option for the design of hydrogel wound dressings for medical applications. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In the present study, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) modified hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC) hydrogel (HBC-RGD) was developed to enhance the adhesion and proliferation of BMSCs within the hydrogel. The successful synthesis of HBC-RGD was confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR. Both HBC and HBC-RGD hydrogel had desired thermosensitivity, biocompatibility and enzymatic degradability in vitro. Compared with HBC hydro gel, HBC-RGD hydrogel was more beneficial for the adhesion and proliferation of BMSCs. Furthermore, the BMSCs incorporated HBC-RGD (BMSCs/HBC-RGD) hydrogel could inhibit the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts (Kfs) and suppress the nodular collagenous fibers of keloid tissue. These results suggested that the HBC-RGD hydrogel could be applied as a potential 3D hydrogel scaffold for cell culture, and BMSCs/HBC-RGD hydrogel was potential to be applied for keloid therapy with subcutaneous in-situ injection in the future.

There are evidenced the preparation possibilities for the natural/synthetic structure as complex gel based on hyaluronic acid conjugated with poly( itaconic anhydride-co-3,9-divinyl-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5] undecane) copolymer decorated with quercetin. The effects of the composition on various properties were assessed. The chemical composition of bioconjugate gels was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. It was established that the new gel structures have enhanced swelling capacity and a typical gel-like behavior. The investigations evidenced the gels responsiveness to stimuli and their high elasticity. The new structures were tested as drug delivery systems. The in vitro release shows the dependence of the mechanism of release on the composition of the gels, evidencing a transport behavior which varies from the Fickian to super case II.

However, traditional methods for reducing silver nanoparticles are usually toxic. To overcome this problem, Sanghuangporus sanghuang polysaccharides (FSHPs) were used as a green reducing agent to prepare silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a size of 3-35 nm. The FSHPs-silver nanoparticles (FSHPs-Ag) composite with chitosan solution were then freeze-dried to obtain a porous sponge dressing of chitosan-FSHPs-Ag (CS-FSHPs-Ag). The internal pores of CS-FSHPs-Ag were between 50 and 100 mu m and had good swelling and water retention properties, which could provide a moist environment for wounds. Based on the experimental results, the appropriate concentration of AgNPs required for CS-FSHPs-Ag to inhibit Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the material treatment and the blank control group, indicating that the material almost showed no toxicity to L929 cells. Finally, this material was used for dressing animal wounds. The results showed that the CS-FSHPs-Ag promoted wound contraction and internal tissue growth better than the wounds treated with Aquacel (R) Ag, which indicated that the CS-FSHPs-Ag has a great potential as an ideal wound dressing material.

Fractions of alpha-keratose (MW = 43-53 kDa) along with protein species with molecular weights between 23 kDa and 33 kDa were identified in the SDS-PAGE analysis result of the extracted protein mixture. DLS and AFM experiments indicated that self-assembled globular nanoparticles with diameters between 15 nm and 100 nm formed at 5 mg/ml keratose concentration. On the other hand, upon incubation of 10 w % keratose solutions at 37 degrees C and 50 degrees C, interconnected keratose hydrogels with respective storage modulus (G') values of 0.17 +/- 0.03 kPa and 3.7 +/- 0.5 kPa were obtained.

These materials have been evaluated for their potential inhibition of adhesion of two key biofilm-forming microalgae Halamphora coffeaeformis and Cylindrotheca closterium). All the tested materials have presented high adhesion inhibition about 80%). Copper-base materials present a high toxicity against H. coffeaeformis. Pure zinc alginate is also toxic for this strain. However, the addition of calcium in zinc alginate leads to the toxicity reduction. The toxicity of these materials differs according to the strains. Consequently, mixed zinc/calcium alginate are efficient at inhibiting microalgal adhesion with a low level of cells toxicity. These alginate hydrogels are promising materials because they are efficient, cheap, easy to develop and eco-friendly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Nassif, L.

'Dip-and-Drag' lateral force atomic force microscopy technique is used here to evaluate the influence of arabinoxylan and xyloglucan on interactions between nanoscale cellulose fibres within a hydrated network of bacterial cellulose. A cohesive zone model of the detachment event between two nano-fibres is used to interpret the experimental data and evaluate inter-fibre adhesion energy. The presence of xyloglucan or arabinoxylan is found to increase the adhesive energy by a factor of 4.3 and 1.3, respectively, which is consistent with these two hemicellulose polysaccharides having different specificity of hydrogen bonding with cellulose. Importantly, xyloglucan's ability to strengthen adhesion between cellulose nano-fibres supports emergent models of the primary plant cell walls (Park & Cosgrove, 2012b), which suggest that xyloglucan chains confined within cellulose-cellulose junctions play a key role in cell wall's mechanical response.","[Dolan, Grace K.; Bonilla, Mauricio R.; Stokes, Jason R.; Yakubov, Gleb E.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Excellence Plant Cell Walls, Australian Res Council, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dolan, Grace K.; Cartwright, Ben; Bonilla, Mauricio R.; Stokes, Jason R.; Yakubov, Gleb E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Gidley, Michael J.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat, Ctr Nutr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bonilla, Mauricio R.] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, E-48011 Bilbao, Spain; [Yakubov, Gleb E.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Food Sci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England","Yakubov, GE (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Excellence Plant Cell Walls, Australian Res Council, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.; Yakubov, GE (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.; Yakubov, GE (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Food Sci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England.",gleb.yakubov@uq.edu.au,,"Yakubov, Gleb/0000-0001-5420-9422; Stokes, Jason/0000-0001-7784-9297; BONILLA, MAURICIO/0000-0002-1379-7413",UQ Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Australian Research Council Discovery Project [DP180101919]; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Walls [CE110001007],"The authors gratefully acknowledge Ms Dongjie Wang for acquiring SEM images used in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S6.

The two production methods were compared by assessing fiber morphology, mass loss, swelling degree, water contact angle, and mechanical properties of the resulting electrospun membranes. Furthermore, the adhesion, proliferation, and morphology of human dermal fibroblasts on the eight types of scaffold produced were evaluated to assess if the blending method used would influence cell-scaffold interaction. Cell adhesion to the different scaffolds lied in the interval 40-60%, with the CS scaffold presenting the lowest value. Interestingly, cell proliferation was the same when comparing polymer blending and FB scaffolds having 3:1 or 1:3 PCL/CS ratios but very different when the ratio was 1:1 - the FB scaffold sustained a proliferation rate double that of the polymer blending scaffold. This work shows that, when blending polymers to improve the properties of a scaffold for tissue engineering or 3D cell culture, their spatial distribution may considerably affect scaffold's properties and should be considered as another parameter requiring optimization.

In biomaterials engineering, attempt has been made on design and manufacture of implant materials with less corrosion, and reduced complications. In the present study, corrosion characteristics of titanium-alumina composites (25 vol% and 50 vol% Al2O3) fabricated by spark plasma sintering were analyzed by polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Physiological Ringer's solution was used as corrosion medium. The corrosion experiments were conducted in two time intervals. Pure titanium was also fabricated and analyzed for comparison. Furthermore, the samples were immersed in Ringer's solution for about 50 days and then characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). From the results of corrosion tests, it was indicated that pure Ti and the Ti-25% Al2O3 had fully passive behavior and experienced breakdown at high voltage in the test potential region. The composite with 25% Al2O3 content also showed superior corrosion resistance. The SEM images of the samples after long time immersion revealed both corroded regions and deposition zones on the surfaces.

The specimens were studied by XRD, FE-SEM and EDS tests. A porous titanium nitride layer about 20 mu m was synthesized on Ti surface, and the main phases of which were c-TiN and TiN0.3. The Vickers hardness of the TiN layer was 618.68 HV, which is about 3 times of the titanium (202.9 HV). The EDS results showed the TiN layer prepared at 300W was a non-stoichiometri compound with mole ratio of Ti to N about 1:0.621. The porcelain coating laser fused on the TiN layer inherited the columnar structure of TiN, which had a rhombus-like intersecting surface. The highest scratching bonding strength (193.21 +/- 23.33 MPa) between TiN layer and Ti was obtained at nitriding power of 300W. The porcelain coating laser fused on the TiN layer inherited the columnar structure of TiN, which had a rhombus-like intersecting surface. The bonding strength between coating and titanium (67.28 MPa) were much higher than the regular bonding strength between the porcelain and Ti (only about 35-40 MPa), which could be ascribed to the good chemical reactivity and wettability between the TiN layer and porcelain.

Freezing water increased linearly with the increase of the water content independently of the polymer ratio. The hydrogels showed an equilibrium water content from 9 to 13 times their mass. The hydrogels exhibited a solid-viscoelastic behavior.

However, the generation of synthetic microenvironments that simulate the effects of natural tissue niches on cell growth and differentiation requires new methods to control hydrogel feature resolution, biofunctionalization and mechanical properties. Here we show how these goals can be achieved by using a pullulan-based hydrogel, engineered in composition and server as cell-adhesive hydrogel, 3D photo-printable in dimension, ranging from the macro- to the micro-scale dimensions, and of tunable mechanical properties. For this, we used absorbers that limit light penetration, achieving 3D patterning through stereolithography with feature vertical resolution of 200 mu m and with overall dimension up to several millimeters. Furthermore, we report the fabrication of 3D pullulan-modified hydrogels by two-photon lithography, with sub-millimetric dimensions and minimum feature sizes down to some microns. These materials open the possibility to produce multiscale printed scaffolds that here we demonstrate to be inert for cell adhesion, but biologically compatible and easily functionalizable with cell adhesive proteins. Under these conditions, successful cell cultures were established in 2D and 3D. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

The position of sulfate group incorporation in the chitosan chain is important for the improvement of its biological mechanism. The substitution of each reactive group of chitosan is required to increase the electrostatic repulsion between the sulfated films and blood proteins or platelets, and, thereby, reduce the thrombus formation. Moreover, the polymeric hydroxyl groups can activate the complement system through the alternative pathway. In this study, we developed SC films, with larger distribution of sulfate groups by substitution of three reactive groups in the chitosan chain to improve its hemocompatibility. Successful chemical modification confirmed the partially 2-N-3,6-O-SC. The hemocompatibility results showed decrease in bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen adsorption, platelet adhesion and an increase in the intrinsic pathway anticoagulant activity. Based on these results, partially tri-SC can be considered suitable candidate for coating blood-contacting medical devices. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The binary alloys were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, chemical composition determination as well as density and porosity measurements. The influence of the chemical composition and method of processing on the final microstructure, and mechanical properties of bulk alloys were studied. The mechanically alloyed Ti23Mo, Ti27Mo and Ti31Mo materials upon sintering at 800 degrees C for 5 min led to the formation of single 13 type phase alloys. All these beta-type alloys have elastic modulus lower than CP microcrystalline alpha-Ti but their hardness is nearly 3 times higher (approx: 460 HV0.3).

One approach to rectify this problem is a rapid endothelialization on the inner wall of the grafts, which could significantly reduce inflammation or hyperplasia. Two critical factors that can affect this process in vivo include that of the biocompatibility of the materials and adhesion strength of cells on its surfaces. Thus, an important area of investigation involves an evaluation of cell adhesion on biomaterials in a dynamic culture system, but only limited research has been directed at examining the relationship between the shear forces resulting from flow rates and cell adhesion on the surface of materials. In this study, an in vitro dynamic culture system was utilized for use in examining such relationship by changing the flow rates. RESULTS Cells adherent on monofilaments were dislodged with a shear force of 5.4 dyn, while most cells adherent on multifilaments tolerated shear forces of 7.0 dyn. CONCLUSION Priority rankings of materials could be generated as a function of the shear forces tested, and the design or application of artificial blood vessel materials for use within specific regions of the body could be optimized.

Our calculations demonstrate that substitution of a P atom by a Si atom in a-HAP (a-Si-HAP) with the creation of OH-vacancies as charge compensation results in a significant increase of the bonding strength of the coating to the substrate. The work of adhesion of the optimized Si-doped interfaces reaches a value of up to -2.52 J m(-2), which is significantly higher than for the stoichiometric a-HAP/a-TiO2. Charge density difference analysis indicates that the dominant interactions at the interface have significant covalent character, and in particular two Ti-O and three Ca-O bonds are formed for a-Si-HAP/a-TiO2 and one Ti-O and three Ca-O bonds for a-HAP/a-TiO2. From the stress-strain curve, the Young's modulus of a-Si-HAP/a-TiO2 is calculated to be about 25% higher than that of the a-HAP/a-TiO2, and the yielding stress is about 2 times greater than that of the undoped model. Our calculations therefore demonstrate that the presence of Si in the a-HAP structure strongly alters not only the bioactivity and resorption rates, but also the mechanical properties of the a-HAP/a-TiO2 interface. The results presented here provide an important theoretical insight into the nature of the chemical bonding at the a-HAP/a-TiO2 interface, and are particularly significant for the practical medical applications of HAP-based biomaterials.","[Grubova, Irina Yu; Surmeneva, Maria A.; Surmenev, Roman A.] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Res Sch Chem & Appl Biomed Sci, Res Ctr Phys Mat Sci & Composite Mat, Lenin Ave 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Grubova, Irina Yu; Huygh, Stijn; Neyts, Erik C.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Chem, PLASMANT Res Grp, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Surmenev, RA (reprint author), Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Res Sch Chem & Appl Biomed Sci, Res Ctr Phys Mat Sci & Composite Mat, Lenin Ave 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia.; Neyts, EC (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Chem, PLASMANT Res Grp, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",surmenev@tpu.ru; erik.neyts@uantwerpen.be,,,Tomsk Polytechnic University,The research is carried out at Tomsk Polytechnic University within the framework of Tomsk Polytechnic University Competitiveness Enhancement Program grant.,,98,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-0256,1879-0801,,COMP MATER SCI,Comput.

To achieve this, culturing the cells on the biocompatible three-dimensional (3D) scaffold is one alternative approach. The new functional bone tissue regeneration could be feasible by the synergetic combinations of cells, biomaterials and bioreactors. Although the field of biomaterial design/development for BTE applications attained reasonable success, development of suitable bioreactor remains still a major challenge. Tissue engineering bioreactors provide the microenvironment required for neo-tissue regeneration, and also can be used to study the physio-chemical cues effect on cell proliferation and differentiation in order to produce functional tissue. In this direction, various bioreactors have been developed and evaluated for the successful development of engineered bone tissue. Continues assessment of tissue development and limitations of the bioreactors lead to the progression of perfusion flow bioreactor system.

It is also necessary to optimize the processes to produce biomaterials from engineered microalgae. We previously reported that genetic improvements of an industrial microalga Nannochloropsis salina by overexpressing a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (NsbHLH2). These transformants showed an improved growth and lipid production particularly during the early phase of culture under batch culture. However, they had faster uptake of nutrients, resulting in earlier starvation and reduced growth during the later stages. We attempted to optimize the growth and lipid production by growing one of the transformants in continuous culture with variable dilution rate and feed nitrogen concentration. Relative to wild-type, NsbHLH2 transformant consumed more nitrate at a high dilution rate (0.5 day(-1)), and had greater biomass production. Subsequently, nitrogen limitation at continuous cultivation led to an increased fatty acid methyl ester production by 83.6 mg l(-1) day(-1). To elucidate genetic mechanisms, we identified the genes containing E-boxes, known as binding sites for bHLH transcription factors. Among these, we selected 18 genes involved in the growth and lipid metabolism, and revealed their positive contribution to the phenotypes via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results provide proof-of-concept that NsbHLH2 can be used to produce biomass and lipids.","[Kang, Nam Kyu; Kim, Eun Kyung; Kim, Young Uk; Chang, Yong Keun] Adv Biomass R&D Ctr, Daejeon, South Korea; [Sung, Min-Gyu; Jeong, Byeong-ryool; Chang, Yong Keun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea","Jeong, BR; Chang, YK (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.; Chang, YK (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Adv Biomass R&D Ctr ABC, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.",bjeong@kaist.ac.kr; changyk@kaist.ac.kr,,"Jeong, Byeong-ryool/0000-0003-0642-1650","Ministry of Science and ICT [ABC-2010-0029728, ABC-2011-0031350]","The Global Frontier Project, funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, Grant/Award Numbers: ABC-2010-0029728, ABC-2011-0031350",,48,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3592,1097-0290,,BIOTECHNOL BIOENG,Biotechnol.

Validation of such models is necessary to ensure that the modeled system behavior accurately represents the physics of the actual system. The goal of this work was to validate a medical image-based nonlinear lumbosacral spine finite element model of a healthy 20-yr-old female subject under physiological moments. Range of motion (ROM), facet joint forces (FJF), and intradiscal pressure (IDP) were compared with experimental values and validated finite element models from the literature. The finite element model presented in this work was in good agreement with published experimental studies and finite element models under pure moments. For applied moments of 7.5 N.m, the ROM in flexion-extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending were 39 deg, 16 deg, and 28 deg, respectively. Excellent agreement was observed between the finite element model and experimental data for IDP under pure compressive loading. The predicted FJFs were lower than those of the experimental results and validated finite element models for extension and torsion, likely due to the nondegenerate properties chosen for the intervertebral disks and morphology of the young female spine. This work is the first to validate a computational lumbar spine model of a young female subject. This model will serve as a valuable tool for predicting orthopedic spinal injuries, studying the effect of intervertebral disk replacements using advanced biomaterials, and investigating soft tissue degeneration.","[Mills, Matthew J.; Sarigul-Klijn, Nesrin] Univ Calif Davis, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, 2132 Bainer Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sarigul-Klijn, Nesrin] Univ Calif Davis, Biomed Engn Dept, 451 E Hlth Sci Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Sarigul-Klijn, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, 2132 Bainer Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Sarigul-Klijn, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Biomed Engn Dept, 451 E Hlth Sci Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mjmills@ucdavis.edu; nsarigulklijn@ucdavis.edu,,,"DynaaTECC (Dynamics, acoustics, aeroelasticity, Theory, Experiments, Computations and Controls) Research Lab","This work was funded by the DynaaTECC (Dynamics, acoustics, aeroelasticity, Theory, Experiments, Computations and Controls) Research Lab.",,61,0,0,3,3,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0148-0731,1528-8951,,J BIOMECH ENG-T ASME,J.

In order to mimic the inorganic and organic phases of bone extracellular matrix (ECM), a bioactive glass-ceramic deriving from a SiO2-P2O5-CaO-MgO-Na2O-K2O parent glass, acting as a substrate in form of a slice, was surface-functionalised with a type I collagen-based coating. In particular, the collagen was blended with a water soluble polyurethane (PUR), synthesised from poly(ethylene glycol), 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate and N-BOC-serinol. The PUR was designed to expose amino groups on the polymeric chain, which can be exploited for the blend stabilisation through crosslinking. The newly synthesised PUR demonstrated to be non-cytotoxic, as assessed by a biological test with MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. The collagen/PUR blend showed good biocompatibility as well. The polymeric coating on the glass-ceramic samples was produced by surface-silanisation, followed by further chemical grafting of the blend, using genipin as a cross linker. The glass-ceramic surface was characterised at each functionalisation step, demonstrating that the procedure allowed obtaining a covalent link between the blend and the substrate. Finally, biological tests performed using human periosteal derived precursor cells demonstrated that the proposed polymer-coated material was a good substrate for bone cell adhesion and growth, and a good candidate to mimic the composite nature of the bone ECM.","[Caddeo, Silvia; Sartori, Susanna; Ciardelli, Gianluca] Politecn Torino, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Turin, Italy; [Caddeo, Silvia; Baino, Francesco; Vitale-Brovarone, Chiara] Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Turin, Italy; [Mattioli-Belmonte, Monica; Dicarlo, Manuela] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Clin & Mol Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Cassino, Claudio] Univ Piemonte Orientate A Avogadro, Dipartirnerzto Sci & Innovaz Tecnol, Alessandria, Italy; [Barbani, Niccoletta] Univ Pisa, Dept Chem Engn Ind Chem & Mat Sci, Pisa, Italy; [Gentile, Piergiorgio] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England","Ciardelli, G (reprint author), Politecn Torino, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Turin, Italy.",gianluca.ciardelli@polito.it,,"Cassino, Claudio/0000-0002-7785-2717","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) under the PRIN 2010-2011 programmme [2010J8RYS7]","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) under the PRIN 2010-2011 programmme (Project: MIND -Engineering physiologically and pathologically relevant organ Models for the INvestigation of age related Diseases -prot. 2010J8RYS7).",,91,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys showed great potentials as an alternative material for urological devices, due to their excellent biodegradability and antibacterial property. In this study, a serial of four promising Mg alloys which contain zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr), i.e., Mg-4Zn-xSr (ZSr41) alloys, were investigated in vitro for potential ureteral stent application. Specifically, these four alloys have 4 wt% Zn in all and 0.15 wt% Sr in ZSr41_A, 0.5 wt% Sr in ZSr41_B, 1.0 wt% Sr in ZSr41_C and 1.5 wt% Sr in ZSr41_D. The cytocompatibility and degradation behaviors of Mg-4Zn-xSr alloys were studied by culturing with human urothelial cells (HUCs) for 24 h and 48 h using exposure culture method. ZSr41_B showed a better cytocompatibility with HUCs among all the Mg-4Zn-xSr alloys in both 24-hour and 48-hour cultures. Moreover, the cytocompatibility of insoluble degradation products of Mg, i.e., MgO and Mg(OH)(2), was also investigated by culturing different concentrations of MgO and Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles with HUCs for 24 h and 48 h. The concentration of MgO and Mg(OH)(2) particles at 0.5 mg/mL and above, showed a significant decrease of cell density and cell size after 24-hour and 48-hour cultures.

Mineral deposits were formed during incubation of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase in sodium glycerophosphate and calcium chloride medium. To modify hydrophobic surface of scaffolds and intensify attachment of coating, scaffolds were incubated at 50 degrees C (thermal activation, TA) or at 37 degrees C after short exposition to lipase (lipase activation, LA). Micro-computed tomography observations demonstrated that both methods resulted in deposition of mineral on the surface of external and internal walls of the scaffolds. Precipitate formed after thermal and lipase activation contained particles with average size of 200-400 nm, and the shape of donuts. In thermal activated PCL coatings X-ray diffraction disclosed peaks typical for hydroxyapatite (HAp), while after lipase activation these peaks could be precisely defined only if left for 6 days in the incubation medium. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy suggested crystalline structure of HAp both after thermal and lipase activation. The adherence of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was initially higher on coated than pristine PCL, but during 7 days of culture the cell number increased and was similar on all tested samples. Alkaline phosphatase activity, considered as a sign of osteogenic differentiation, measured on PCL samples after 7 days was 2-3 times lower on pristine PCL than on the coated samples, but after 2 weeks increased significantly and reached similar value as on the calcium phosphate substrates.","[Jaroszewicz, Jakub; Idaszek, Joanna; Choinska, Emilia; Szlazak, Karol; Swieszkowski, Wojciech] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Woloska 141, PL-02507 Warsaw, Poland; [Hyc, Anna; Osiecka-Iwan, Anna; Moskalewski, Stanislaw] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Histol & Embryol, Chalubinskiego 5, PL-02004 Warsaw, Poland","Jaroszewicz, J (reprint author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Woloska 141, PL-02507 Warsaw, Poland.",jakubjaroszewicz@wp.pl,,"Jaroszewicz, Jakub/0000-0002-5037-8082; Choinska, Emilia/0000-0003-3194-3776",National Science Centre [2016/21/B/NZ1/00289]; National Centre for Research and Development [STRATEGMED3/306888/NCBR/2017],The authors are thankful to Dr. Bartosz Michalski for his assistance with the XRD measurements.

Among them, blending is recognized as a simple method. However, the conventional blending materials commonly lead to an insufficient modification, which is mainly caused by the poor miscibility between the blending materials and the matrixes, the elution of the hydrophilic materials from the matrixes during the use and storage, and the insufficient surface enrichment of the blending materials. Aiming to solve the abovementioned disadvantages, we developed novel polyethersulfone/poly(acrylic acid-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) networked submicrogels (PES/P(AA-VP) NSs), which were blended with PES to enhance the antifouling properties, antibacterial adhesion and haemocompatible properties of PES membranes. As results, the PES/P(AA-VP) NSs showed good miscibility with the PES matrix, and hydrophilic submicrogels would enrich onto the membrane surface during the phase inversion process due to the surface segregation. The entanglement between the PES matrix and the networked submicrogels would effectively limit the elution of the submicrogels. In conclusion, the modified PES membranes prepared by blending with the PES/P(AA-VP) NSs might draw great attention for the application in haemodialysis fields.","[Ji, Hai-Feng; He, Chao; Wang, Rui; Fan, Xin; Xiong, Lian; Zhao, Wei-Feng; Zhao, Chang-Sheng] Sichuan Univ, Coll Polymer Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Polymer Mat Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wei-Feng] Donghua Univ, State Key Lab Modificat Chem Fibers & Polymer Mat, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China","Zhao, CS (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Polymer Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Polymer Mat Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Zhao, WF (reprint author), Donghua Univ, State Key Lab Modificat Chem Fibers & Polymer Mat, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",zhaoscukth@163.com; zhaochsh70@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51503125, 51673125, 51773127]; State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, Donghua University [LK1619]; Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team of Sichuan Province [2015TD0001]","This work was financially sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51503125, 51673125 and 51773127), State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, Donghua University (LK1619) and the Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team of Sichuan Province (Grant No. 2015TD0001).

And further to conduct quantitative characterization on structural properties, self-assembly kinetics and gelation properties of these collagens. Herein, a two-step collagen extraction method (pepsin-pepsin) was established with the high yield. Meanwhile, structural measurements of high-yield collagen (pepsin-soluble collagen, PSC) and acid-soluble collagen (ASC) indicated that both collagens maintained the typical triple helical conformation of collagen type I. Moreover, the fibrillogenesis tests of PSC and ASC at the various temperatures confirmed that self-assembly were the entropy-driven process. The gelation time of both ASC and PSC was determined by the dynamic time sweep at the different frequencies combined with Winter's criterion. The self-assembly kinetics results showed that fibrillogenesis rate for ASC solution was faster, and more liable to gelation relative to PSC. Mechanical measurements suggested that ASC showed the more resistance ability to deformation than PSC due to more complicated architecture, confirmed by higher fractal dimension. However, the equivalent typical assemblies of PSC to ASC at the various stages can still be expected via controlling incubation time or temperature under the guidance of Arrhenius equation. This study would provide some strategies for achieving maximum utilization of waste biomass and significant insights into the mechanisms underlying the quantitative differences in multiple hierarchy conformation (molecule, fibrillogenesis and hydrogel) of ASC and PSC, which may benefit for subsequent design, development and optimization of collagen-based hydrogels in biomedical industries.","[Zhu, Shichen; You, Juan; Yin, Tao; Hu, Yang; Xiong, Shanbai] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shichen; You, Juan; Yin, Tao; Hu, Yang; Xiong, Shanbai] Huazhong Agr Univ, MOE Key Lab Environm Correlat Dietol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shichen; Hu, Yang; Xiong, Shanbai] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Efficient & Hlth Prod Fish, Changde 415000, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Qijuan; Gu, Zhipeng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Key Lab Sensing Technol & Biomed Instrument Guang, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mingtao] Yichun Univ, Coll Chem & Bioengn, Yichun 336000, Peoples R China","Hu, Y; Xiong, SB (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.; Hu, Y; Xiong, SB (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, MOE Key Lab Environm Correlat Dietol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",huyang@mail.hzau.edu.cn; xiongsb@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,"Hu, Yang/0000-0003-3416-6757",National Natural Science Foundation of China [21506070]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662018JC019]; Agriculture Research System of China [CARS-45-27],"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21506070), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2662018JC019) and Agriculture Research System of China (No. CARS-45-27).",,57,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

A perfect scaffold ought to be made of biomaterials that duplicate the structure and properties of natural bone. However, the production of living tissue constructs that are architecturally, functionally and mechanically comparable to natural bone is the major challenge in the treatment and regeneration of bone tissue in orthopaedics and in dentistry. In this work, we have employed a polymeric replication method to fabricate hydroxyapatite (HAP) scaffolds using gum tragacanth (GT) as a natural binder. GT is a natural gum collected from the dried sap of several species of Middle Eastern legumes of the genus Astragalus, possessing antibacterial and wound healing properties. The synthesized porous HAP scaffolds were analyzed structurally and characterized for their phase purity and mechanical properties. The biocompatibility of the porous HAP scaffold was confirmed by seeding the scaffold with Vero cells, and its bioactivity assessed by immersing the scaffold in simulated body fluid (SBF). Our characterization data showed that the biocompatible porous HAP scaffolds were composed of highly interconnecting pores with compressive strength ranging from 0.036 MPa to 2.954 MPa, comparable to that of spongy bone. These can be prepared in a controlled manner by using an appropriate binder concentration and sintering temperature. These HAP scaffolds have properties consistent with normal bone and should be further developed for potential application in bone implants.","[Lett, J.

However, the now available EC-ECM was mainly secreted by the in vitro cultured endothelial cells which lacked a physiological growth environment in vivo, such as blood flow shear stress (BFSS) acting, thus had a serious defect of biocompatibility. Our previous work markedly improved the biocompatibility of the EC-ECM modified materials by simulating the BFSS acting to control the endothelial cells with hyaluronic acid (HA) micro-pattern. In this contribution, the EC-ECM was further enriched onto the HA micro-pattern via a novel layer-by-layer decellularizatio method. In vitro platelets adhesion/activation, macrophages attachment test and ex vivo blood experiment of New Zealand White Rabbits suggested better blood compatibility and anti-inflammation property of this novel biomimetic ECM surface. The endothelial cells culture tests and in vivo rat subcutaneous implantation also proved its good pro-endothelialization function and tissue compatibility. In summary, the present study demonstrated better biocompatibility of the novel biomimetic ECM surface and its potential application for cardiovascular biomaterials modification.","[Zou, Dan; Luo, Xiao; Han, Cong-zhen; Li, Jing-an; Yang, Ping; Huang, Nan] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Adv Technol Mat, Minist Educ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing-an] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Li, Qian] Natl Ctr Int Res Micronano Molding Technol, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China; [Li, Qian] Key Lab Micro Molding Technol Henan Prov, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China","Yang, P (reprint author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Adv Technol Mat, Minist Educ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Li, JA (reprint author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.; Li, Q (reprint author), Natl Ctr Int Res Micronano Molding Technol, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China.; Li, Q (reprint author), Key Lab Micro Molding Technol Henan Prov, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China.",lijingan@zzu.edu.cn; yangping8@263.net; Qianli@zzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31570963]; Key scientific research projects of higher education institutions in Henan Province [16A430030]; Key Project and Special Foundation of Research, Development and Promotion in Henan Province [182102310076]; Joint Fund for Fostering Talents of NCIR-MMT HNKL-MMT [MMT2017-01]; Young Teachers Foundation of Zhengzhou University [32210475]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31570963), Key scientific research projects of higher education institutions in Henan Province (No. 16A430030), Key Project and Special Foundation of Research, Development and Promotion in Henan Province (No. 182102310076), the Joint Fund for Fostering Talents of NCIR-MMT & HNKL-MMT (No. MMT2017-01), and Young Teachers Foundation of Zhengzhou University (No. 32210475).",,55,0,0,10,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

The neat polymers and the blends were characterized, in film form, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM). After supercritical fluid technology, in scaffolds form, the samples were characterized by FEG-SEM, pore size, density, cytotoxicity and cell adhesion. For film characterization the PU/PDLLA sample presented intermediate characteristics compared to the neat polymers, exhibiting the behavior of both polymers in the sample without phase separation in the FEG-SEM micrograph and bimodal molar weight distribution by GPC. The scaffolds showed interconnectivity and pore size of 141 mu m +/- 108 mu m for PUsc and 52 mu m +/- 32 mu m for PDLLAsc. The PU/PDLLAsc exhibited a bimodal structure in which the PU in the mixture revealed pores of 75 mu m +/- 57 mu m, while for PDLLA, the pore size was 19 mu m +/- 12 mu m. In vitro tests confirmed the adhesion of L929 cells to PUsc, PDLLAsc and PU/PDLLAsc, showing no cytotoxic effect.

The present study reports on the development of composite membranes of Chitosan (CS)-Polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix, incorporating particles of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO). The properties that are relevant for intended applications in tissue regeneration and antibacterial coatings of implants were assessed. It was found that the addition of 1% (w/w - relative to the mass of CS) of each metal oxide promoted satisfactory bacteriostatic activity and exhibited no cytotoxic effects towards the Vero cell line. The formation of bonds between the CS/PEG matrix and ionic species from the powders enhanced the cross-linking degree and mechanical properties of composite membranes in comparison to the non-doped membrane with the same polymer matrix (CS/PEG = 70/30%). A gradual degradation of the composite membranes over the immersion time in simulated body fluid (SBF) was accompanied by a continuous surface deposition of uniform apatite layer.","[Pereira, Ines C.; Neto, Ana S.; Ferreira, J.

Recent investigations have suggested an important role of opportunistic fungal cells associated with non-responding antibacterial treatments. Thus, in order to evaluate the early Candida albicans (C. albicans) behavior; we built on Ti6Al4V surfaces nanopores (NPs) with controlled diameters applying oxidative nanopatterning for 30 (NP30) and 60 min (NP60). As a result of nanopatterning NPs with diameters of 12 and 24 nm were synthesized. Physicochemical differences were observed between both types of NPs, the most highlighting of which are anatase phase formation and improved hydrophilicity of NP60. C. albicans adhesion and colonization was assessed using scanning electron microscopy and by yeast counting for viability evaluation. The fungal behavior on the substrates was significantly different, showing an initial exopolysaccharide secretion stimulated by the nanopatterned surfaces. Larger NPs led to an important reduction in viability with decreased cell-surface contact bonds. The obtained results demonstrate that special control in the fabrication of nanostructured TiO2 materials can improve the early fungal resistance, especially for dental implants.","[Valdez-Salas, Benjamin; Beltran-Partida, Ernesto] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Ingn, Lab Biol Mol & Canc, Blvd Benito Juarez & Calle Normal S-N, Mexicali 21040, Baja California, Mexico; [Valdez-Salas, Benjamin; Beltran-Partida, Ernesto; Nedev, Nicola; Ibarra-Wiley, Roberto; Salinas, Ricardo; Curiel-Alvarez, Mario] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Ingn, Lab Corros & Mat Avanzados, Blvd Benito Juarez & Calle Normal S-N, Mexicali 21040, Baja California, Mexico; [Valenzuela-Ontiveros, Yaneth; Perez, Guillermo] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Odontol Mexicali, Av Zotoluca & Chinampas S-N, Mexicali 21040, Baja California, Mexico","Valdez-Salas, B (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Ingn, Lab Biol Mol & Canc, Blvd Benito Juarez & Calle Normal S-N, Mexicali 21040, Baja California, Mexico.",benval@uabc.edu.mx,,"Valdez-Salas, Benjamin/0000-0002-6788-7545",Autonomous University of Baja California by 19va Convocatoria Interna de Apoyos a Proyectos de Investigacion [2060]; Apoyo al Fortalecimiento de Cuerpos Academicos 2017 SEP-PRODEP [25770],The authors thank the Autonomous University of Baja California for the grant 2060 provided by 19va Convocatoria Interna de Apoyos a Proyectos de Investigacion and the funding 25770 to UABC-CA-276 afforded by Apoyo al Fortalecimiento de Cuerpos Academicos 2017 SEP-PRODEP.,,42,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

The pore sizes ranged from 100 to 500 mu m. Manufacturing parameters were tuned from sub-critical to super-critical conditions to optimize porosity, pore size, pore interconnectivity, and mechanical properties. The biological behavior of the constructs was evaluated by in vitro toxicity and proliferation assays and in vivo subcutaneous biocompatibility.

Despite of its favourable advantages, poor mechanical and degradative properties of biomaterials are of great concern. To this regard, crosslinkers have emerged as a smart and promising tool to augment the biological functionality of biopolymers. Different crosslinkers have been extensively used in past decades to develop bone substitutes, but the implications of toxic response and adverse reactions are truly precarious after implantation. Traditional crosslinker like glutaraldehyde has been widely used in numerous bio-implants but the potential toxicity is largely being debated with many disproving views. As alternative, green chemicals, enzymatic and non-enzymatic chemicals, bi-functional epoxies, zero-length crosslinkers and physical crosslinkers have been introduced to achieve the desired properties of a bone substitute. In this review, systematic literature search was performed on PubMed database to identify the most commonly used crosslinkers for developing promising bone like materials. The relevant articles were identified, analysed and reviewed in this paper giving due importance to different crosslinking methodologies and comparing their effectiveness and efficacy in regard to material composition, scaffold production, crosslinker dosage, toxicity and immunogenicity. This review summarizes the recent developments in crosslinking mechanism with an emphasis placed on their ability to link proteins through bonding reactions. Finally, this study also covers the convergent and divergent methodologies of crosslinking strategies also giving special importance in retrieving the current limitations and future opportunities of crosslinking modalities in bone tissue engineering.","[Krishnakumar, Gopal Shankar; Muthusamy, Shalini; John, Mary Arlene] Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sampath, Sowndarya] Cent Leather Res Inst, Council Sci & Ind Res, Dept Polymer Sci & Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Krishnakumar, GS (reprint author), Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India.",gopalshankar@bitsathy.ac.in,,,"Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Govt. of India, New Delhi [2017-2789/CMB-BMS]","Sowndarya Sampath, gratefully acknowledges Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Govt. of India, New Delhi, for providing financial assistance as Research Associate (RA) fellowship through Extramural Research Projects (IRIS ID No: 2017-2789/CMB-BMS).",,147,0,0,17,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

In this work, a tricomponent bioactive nanocomposite (nHA-CH-TFSP) assembling nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA), Chitosan (CH) and Trigonella foenum graecum seed polysaccharide (TFSP) was developed using co-precipitation method and investigated against bicomponent nHA-CH nanocomposite for bone tissue engineering. In contrast to nHA-CH nanocomposite, nHA-CH-TFSP nanocomposite exhibited rough and interconnected porous structure as revealed by SEM with the porosity (603 +/- 0.17) lying in the range of cancellous bone. The incorporation of TFSP in nHA-CH substantially enhanced the in vitro water absorption capacity and protein adsorption ability along with appropriate biodegradation rate. Additionally, the nHA-CH-TFSP nanocomposite exhibited superior antibacterial activity. The nHA-CH-TFSP evinced a compressive strength of 6.7 +/- 0.24 MPa and a compressive modulus of 100 +/- 1.4 MPa, which fulfill the strength requisite of cancellous bone and could provide strong support for the growth of osteoblasts cells. Furthermore, the in vitro bioactivity study demonstrated its excellent biomineralization capacity in comparison to nHA-CH. The synthesized nHA-CH-TFSP nanocomposite exhibited better cytocompatibility towards the MG-63 cells along with its haemocompatible nature. Taken together the results of the present study indicate that nHA-CH-TFSP could serve as a prospective analogue for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The hydrogel offered a simple, effective and eco-friendlier support material with >90% of immobilization efficiency of horseradish peroxidase. The surface morphology and functional properties of the agarose-chitosan hydrogel with and without immobilized horseradish peroxidase were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared, respectively. The agarose-chitosan hydrogel-immobilized horseradish peroxidase (ACH-HRP) exhibited wide-working pH and temperature stability, and promising reusability for its substrate oxidation. The ACH-HRP preserved a better activity under acidic environments, pH 4.0 (38 vs. 5.9%), and well stabilized under alkaline conditions, retaining a 3.9-folds greater activity than a free counterpart at pH 10. With reference to a free enzyme, 1.6- and 4-fold greater catalytic activity was achieved at 50 and 70 degrees C, respectively, by the immobilized HRP. Further, the hydrogel displayed insignificant loss in enzyme functionality sustaining above 90% and 60% of original activity after 5 and 10 continuous cycles of use. HPLC profile corroborated the enzyme-assisted Reactive Blue 19 (RB-19) degradation, whereas UPLC/MS analysis scrutinized the dye degradation intermediates and a tentative mechanistic degradation pathway was proposed. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that ACH-HRP is a promising option for use as industrial biocatalyst in diverse biotechnological applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Viscoelastic polymer-based flexible abrasive media was used to finish these surfaces with different pressure and number of cycles. The obtained surface roughness and surface topography were measured using profilometer, and morphology of the surface was studied using a scanning electron microscope. Further, the wettability of the finished surface was studied by measuring the contact angle (theta) for three liquids-water, formamide, and diiodomethane using the sessile drop technique. The measured contact angles were used to ascertain the surface free energy components using Van Oss Chaudhury-Good equation. Significant difference was observed on surface roughness, contact angle, and surface energy of the machined surfaces at different finishing cycles. Also, the different tendencies of the droplet contact angle and surface energy have been observed along the direction parallel and perpendicular to the finishing direction and it gave a strong conclusion that surface roughness and surface textures play a significant role in wetting characteristics. So, this work provides an overview of the interaction between droplet and surface topography of finished SS316L and Ti-6Al-4V surfaces. Further, an empirical model has been developed using the response surface methodology (RSM) for output responses namely, average surface roughness (R-a) and material removed (MR). Interactive effects of number of cycles and pressure on average surface roughness and material removed are discussed in this paper.","[Kumar, Santhosh S.; Hiremath, Somashekhar S.] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Mech Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India","Hiremath, SS (reprint author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Mech Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",somashekhar@iitm.ac.in,,,,,,46,0,0,5,5,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2051-672X,,,SURF TOPOGR-METROL,Surf.

Despite considerable research on vascular scaffolds, there has still been only limited development of scaffold materials possessing both sufficient mechanical strengths and biological effects for vascular application. In this work, we designed a mechanically robust, bilayered scaffold and manufactured it by combining electrospinning (ELSP) and three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques. This material was coated with polydopamine (PDA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was grafted directly on the scaffold surface to induce potent angiogenic activity. We confirmed that the coated-PDA layer was evenly deposited on the bare polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold and could enable abundant VEGF immobilization with enhanced hydrophilicity. The VEGF immobilized porous tubular scaffold was well prepared without mechanical weakness induced by surface modification steps. During in vitro and in vivo testing, VEGF immobilized scaffolds elicited markedly enhanced vascular cell proliferation and angiogenic differentiation, as compared to non-treated groups. These results demonstrate that the developed scaffolds may represent an innovative paradigm in vascular tissue engineering by inducing angiogenesis as a means of remodeling and healing vascular defects for use in restorative procedures.

The mass transfer during the HPI for up to 20 min (for emulsion-I) followed a pseudo-second order kinetics model in all fruits. The highest and the lowest final mass intake belonged to apple (18 g/100 g) and strawberry (6 g/100 g), respectively. The HPI of emulsions with different premix combinations (emulsions I to IV) was evaluated with a 20-min treatment time for all fruits.

Chitin degree of acetylation, crystalline structure and microfibril arrangement differentiate chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, no information are available on the relationship between the mechanical properties and the degree of acetylation (DA) in chitin samples in which the microfibril arrangement does not change. Here, samples of beta-chitin with decreasing DA, up to chitosan, were prepared using the squid pen of Loligo vulgaris. These samples were characterized by CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analyses, synchrotron X-ray fiber diffraction and tensile tests. The results showed a similar microfibril arrangement decreasing the DA, except for the chitosan sample. The mechanical properties showed an increase of the maximum strain and a reduction of the maximum stress and Young's modulus, decreasing the DA. These changes, not linear with the DA, were related to structural changes at molecular structure level. The knowledge deriving from this study is of interest both for the understanding of the mechanical properties of chitinous biological samples, but also for the design and synthesis of new biomacromolecular materials.","[Montroni, Devis; Fermani, Simona; Falini, Giuseppe] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Chem Giacomo Ciamician, Via Selmi 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Morellato, Kavin; Cristofolini, Luca] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Ind Engn DIN, Bologna, Italy; [Torri, Giangiacomo; Naggi, Annamaria] Ist Ric Chim & Biochim G Ronzoni Milano, Via Giuseppe Colombo 81, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Falini, G (reprint author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Chem Giacomo Ciamician, Via Selmi 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",giuseppe.falini@unibo.it,,"Cristofolini, Luca/0000-0002-7473-6868",Consorzio Interuniversitario di Ricerca in Chimica dei Metalli nei Sistemi Biologici,"We thank the XRD1 beamline, Elettra, Trieste, Italy, for the collection of the X-ray fiber diffraction images.

Many thermoresponsive polymers have the ability to form physical hydrogel networks in response to temperature changes, which are particularly useful for emerging biomedical applications, including cell therapies, drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, wound healing and 3D bioprinting. In particular, the use of polysaccharides with thermoresponsive properties has been of interest due to their wide availability, versatile functionality, biodegradability, and in many cases, inherent biocompatibility. Naturally thermoresponsive polysaccharides include agarose, carrageenans and gellan gum, which exhibit upper critical solution temperatures, transitioning from a solution to a gel state upon cooling. Arguably, this limits their use in biomedical applications, particularly for cell encapsulation as they require raised temperatures to maintain a solution state that may be detrimental to living systems. Conversely, significant progress has been made over recent years to develop synthetically modified polysaccharides, which tend to exhibit lower critical solution temperatures, transitioning from a solution to a gel state upon warming. Of particular interest are thermoresponsive polysaccharides with a lower critical solution temperature in between room temperature and physiological temperature, as their solutions can conveniently be manipulated at room temperature before gelling upon warming to physiological temperature, which makes them ideal candidates for many biological applications. Therefore, this review provides an introduction to the different types of thermoresponsive polysaccharides that have been developed, their resulting hydrogels and properties, and the exciting applications that have emerged as a result of these properties.","[Graham, Sarah; Marina, Paula Facal; Blencowe, Anton] Univ South Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Marina, Paula Facal; Blencowe, Anton] Univ South Australia, Future Ind Inst, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia","Blencowe, A (reprint author), Univ South Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",antonb@unimelb.edu.au,,"blencowe, anton/0000-0002-7630-4874","Cooperative Research Centre for Cell Therapy Manufacturing (CRC CTM), Australia; Playford Trust (South Australia, Australia); CRC CTM","This work is supported by the Cooperative Research Centre for Cell Therapy Manufacturing (CRC CTM), Australia.

The layer-by-layer technique used in the film's preparation associated with the behaviour at different pH allowed to explore separately each interaction - polysaccharide-polysaccharide and polysaccharide-ions. The entanglement between polysaccharides, the interaction of the oppositely charged polysaccharides ionic groups (amine for chitosan and carboxylate for xanthan) and the interaction with Ca2+ ions confers a pH-responsive behaviour to the films.

To deliver on this aim, the European Commission (EC) launched the bioeconomy strategy in 2012. At the heart of this policy is the concept of the sustainable Biorefinery, which is based centrally on a cost-effective conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into bioenergy and bioproducts. The first generation of biorefineries was based on utilization of edible food crops, which raised a ""food vs. fuel"" debate and questionable sustainability issues. To overcome this, lignocellulosic feedstock options currently being pursued range from non-food crops to agroforestry residues and wastes. Notwithstanding this, advanced biorefining is still an emerging sector, with unanswered questions relating to the choice of feedstocks, cost-effective lignocellulosic pretreatment, and identification of viable end products that will lead to sustainable development of this industry. Therefore, this review aims to provide a critical update on the possible future directions of this sector, with an emphasis on its role in the future European bioeconomy, against a background of global developments.","[Hassan, Shady S.; Jaiswal, Amit K.] Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Sci & Hlth, Sch Food Sci & Environm Hlth, Cathal Brugha St, Dublin 1, Ireland; [Hassan, Shady S.; Williams, Gwilym A.] Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Sci & Hlth, Sch Biol Sci, Kevin St, Dublin 8, Ireland","Jaiswal, AK (reprint author), Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Sci & Hlth, Sch Food Sci & Environm Hlth, Cathal Brugha St, Dublin 1, Ireland.",amit.jaiswal@dit.ie,,,Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) under the Fiosraigh Scholarship programme,"Authors would like to acknowledge the funding from Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) under the Fiosraigh Scholarship programme, 2017.",,106,0,0,27,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

While being inherently chemically inert and therefore biocompatible and having very short lived post-radiation free radicals, PEEK presents different mechanical properties depending on its degree of crystallinity. It can be processed via extrusion, injection or compression moulding. However, these techniques do not allow high precision control over the fine morphological structure that strongly influences mechanical properties. Microinjection moulding, in contrast, makes it possible to produce fine details of medical implants with high precision and accuracy. Another advantage of this method is the controlled production of the material with heterogeneous structure due to variations in crystallinity. Having stiffness in the middle of the sample different from that at the edges enables a structure that mimics the bone/cartilage parts of an implant. This paper reports on the manufacturing of PEEK components by microinjection moulding, and their characterisation by physico-chemical (XRD, SAXS, TEM, FTIR, POM) and mechanical (tensile testing) means, in order to assess the suitability of use for biomedical application, such as spinal implants. We discuss the influence of such parameters as mould temperatures, injection speeds and hold pressures on the crystallinity and mechanical properties of the material.","[Tuinea-Bobe, C.

The microstructure dictates material performance and depends on the raw mix composition. Synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography was employed to describe the 3D microstructure and its time evolution during hardening and gain insights into the reaction mechanisms. Any excess water with respect to the stoichiometry of the reaction brought about an increase in porosity, but, notably, a reduction in the average pore size. Crystals filled the water pockets' in the ceramic volume by growing larger, although less densely packed, increasing the complexity of the pore shape. Platelet over elongated crystal habit was favoured. Such a change in shape is likely related to a change in reaction mechanism, as crystallization from a gel-like amorphous precursor is hindered and progressively substituted by a through-solution mechanism. It is proposed that the time evolution of the microstructure is dictated by the balance between crystallization from amorphous precursor, prevailing in relatively dense' systems (with stoichiometric water or in low excess), and water segregation, prevailing at higher water contents. The former mechanism was shown to produce an increase in porosity with time, because of the density mismatch between the amorphous and the crystalline phase.","[Viani, Alberto; Sotiriadis, Konstantinos] Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Telc, Inst Theoret & Appl Mech, Batelovska 485, Telc 58856, Czech Republic; [Lanzafame, Gabriele; Mancini, Lucia] Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste SCpA, SS 14 Km 163-5,Area Sci Pk, I-34149 Trieste, Italy","Viani, A (reprint author), Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Telc, Inst Theoret & Appl Mech, Batelovska 485, Telc 58856, Czech Republic.",viani@itam.cas.cz,"Viani, Alberto/H-2153-2014","Viani, Alberto/0000-0002-6019-1094; Sotiriadis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9848-4028; Lanzafame, Gabriele/0000-0001-5352-9918; Mancini, Lucia/0000-0003-2416-3464","Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy [LO1219]","Funding was provided by Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy (Grant No. LO1219).",,65,0,0,20,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

The effects of the aspect ratio of primary hydroxyapatite nanorods (HN), suspension concentration for spray drying and heat treatment temperature were explored. The results indicated that HN with a lower aspect ratio of 2 (HN-2) and a heat treatment temperature of 500 degrees C were beneficial to the construction of high-performance MCHN (MCHN-2). As compared to HN-2, MCHN-2 had a further increased filling amount by 10%. More importantly, the flexural strength, flexural modulus and compressive strength of the composite resin were greatly improved by 36.3%, 11.4% and 56.6%, respectively.

In recent years, numerous experimental explorations of cell captured on nanopatterned surfaces have been developed. However, the effects of topographies of nanopatterned surfaces on the ability to capture cells are not yet well understood. Here, we explain the effects of topographies on cell capture by establishing a thermodynamic model. Our theoretical results reveal that underlying physical mechanism of cell captured on topographical surfaces which clarifies the ability of cell capture is determined by the comparison of adhesion energy and deformation energy of cell membrane. According to the calculated results, the phase diagrams of the ability to capture cells on nanostructures (e.g., nanoparticles and nanowires) have been constructed, which can clarify the interrelated effects between the ability to capture cells and surfaced topographies of nanostructures. From the phase, we can predict the ability to capture cells on different topographical surfaces. Meanwhile, the predictive power of the theoretical model is confirmed by our experiments. On the other hand, the predictive results of theoretical model are in good agreement with cases from the studies.","[Zhou, Jing; Dang, Zechun; Li, Jinqi; Li, Xinlei; Chen, Tongsheng] South China Normal Univ, Coll Biophoton, MOE Key Lab Laser Life Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jing; Dang, Zechun; Li, Jinqi; Li, Xinlei; Chen, Tongsheng] South China Normal Univ, Coll Biophoton, Inst Laser Life Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Yu; Yang, Yuhua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanotechnol Res Ctr, State Key Lab Optoelect Mat & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Li, XL; Chen, TS (reprint author), South China Normal Univ, Coll Biophoton, MOE Key Lab Laser Life Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Li, XL; Chen, TS (reprint author), South China Normal Univ, Coll Biophoton, Inst Laser Life Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Yang, YH (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanotechnol Res Ctr, State Key Lab Optoelect Mat & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xlli@scnu.edu.cn; yangyuh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn; chentsh@scnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61527825, 81471699]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030313389, 2018A030313125]; Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou [201805010002]","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 61527825 and 81471699), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grants Nos. 2017A030313389 and 2018A030313125), and the Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou (Grant Nos. 201805010002).",,43,0,0,12,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

Bone healing can be improved by the application of osteoconductive and osteoinductive biomaterials. Microcalcite (MCA) as a naturally available calcium carbonate-based biomaterial derived from marble may have the potential to improve bone healing. Herein, we studied for the first time, if MCA in combination with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can be used as a bone graft material for bone healing in vivo. For this purpose, osteotomies were induced in CD-1 mice (n = 60). Animals received into the osteotomy gap either MCA-loaded PRP (MCA + PRP; n = 20), PRP alone (PRP; n = 20) or no application (NONE; n = 20). Bone healing was evaluated at two and five weeks after osteotomy by micro-computed tomography (mu CT), histomorphometric, immunohistochemical and Western Blot analyses. mu CT of MCA + PRP femurs revealed more bone volume and an increased polar moment of inertia, indicating a higher biomechanical stability when compared to PRP and NONE femurs. Histomorphometry revealed an increased total callus area after two weeks and a reduced callus tissue area after five weeks in MCA + PRP and PRP animals compared to NONE animals, indicating an accelerated process of bone healing and remodeling over the study period. Moreover, histomorphometric analyses demonstrated an increased fraction of osseous tissue within the callus in MCA + PRP femurs when compared to PRP and NONE femurs. Immunohistochemical analyses showed increased numbers of Ki67(+) cells in callus tissue of MCA + PRP femurs. Of interest, Western Blotting revealed a significantly reduced expression of BMP-4 in MCA + PRP animals, while the expression of BMP-2 did not reveal any significant differences between the groups. This indicates a modified balance between angiogenesis and osteogenesis due to MCA. In conclusion, the application of MCA with PRP improved bone healing in a murine osteotomy model and, thus, might be a promising novel bone graft material which may be of interest for clinical fracture treatment.","[Orth, Marcel; Braun, Benedikt J.; Fritz, Tobias; Holstein, Joerg H.; Histing, Tina; Pohlemann, Tim] Saarland Univ, Dept Trauma Hand & Reconstruct Surg, Homburg, Germany; [Orth, Marcel; Shadmanov, Takhirjan; Scheuer, Claudia; Histing, Tina; Laschke, Matthias W.; Menger, Michael D.] Saarland Univ, Inst Clin & Expt Surg, Homburg, Germany","Orth, M (reprint author), Saarland Univ, Dept Trauma Hand & Reconstruct Surg, Homburg, Germany.; Orth, M (reprint author), Saarland Univ, Inst Clin & Expt Surg, Homburg, Germany.",marcel.orth@uks.eu,,,,,,39,0,0,18,18,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-6041,1748-605X,,BIOMED MATER,Biomed.

A range of structural, mechanical and practical techniques were employed to characterise the hydrogels including, FTIR, UV/VIS, phase contrast microscopy, XRD, DMA, swelling and hydrolytic stability. Finally, looking towards application as a dressing, these materials demonstrated low cell adhesion through a keratinocyte cell culture assay. The results support both the potential application of these hydrogels and provide insight into the role of each component polymer in the material.

Direct surface functionalization with these biomolecules often creates regions presenting non-homogeneous and altered protein functionality. Aptamers have been shown to be an effective method to enhance the biocompatibility of biomaterials by acting as docking points for biomolecules capable of improving cell responses and the colonization/proliferation processes. Here mass spectrometry (MS) was successfully applied as an analytical approach to study the interactions between a fibronectin fragment (FN) and anti-fibronectin aptamers in solution and on a chitosan film. MethodsA 30kDa N-terminal fibronectin fragment, a ssDNA anti-fibronectin 40 nucleotide long aptamer and chitosan 95/50 (degree of deacetylation 92.6-97.5%; molecular weight 80-220kDa) were used. First, the dynamics of the FN in aqueous solution, in the presence or absence of anti-FN-specific DNA aptamers, were described. Thus, the same study was carried out on 2% (w/w) chitosan-based films, functionalized with FN alone or through aptamers as selective spacers. ResultsAmide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis identified the SYRIGDTWSKKDNRGNL and YRVGDTYERPKDSMI, YVVGETWEKPYQGWMM and WERTYLGNAL fragments as presumably involved in the interaction of FN with aptamers. MS findings indicated the improved functionality of FN on chitosan when aptamers were used as selective spacer, and this may explain why cells preferentially attached to aptamer-bound FN rather than on chitosan-FN films. ConclusionsAptamers did not affect the amount of adsorbed FN, but influenced its conformation enhancing its biological activity toward adhesion and growth of osteoblasts. HDX-MS data allowed the identification of the FN/aptamer interaction regions.

N-Halamine is one of the most effective antibacterial agents, with broad-spectrum efficacy against microorganisms, good stability, and reproducibility. Due to the nanosize effect and high specific surface area of NCC, N-halamine-modified NCC is potentially an excellent biocidal compound. In this paper, an N-halamine precursor 1-hydroxymethyl-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (HDH) was used to modify NCC with cyanuric chloride (cych) as the bonding agent. After chlorination, the produced NCC-cych-HDH-Cl became antibacterial. The synthesized NCC-cych-HDH-Cl was added to a chitosan (CS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution to prepare antibacterial films. The optimum mixing ratio of PVA and CS in the PVA/CS films and concentration of NCC-cych-HDH-Cl were investigated. The surface morphologies and mechanical properties of the antibacterial films were characterized with scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and mechanical strength tests. The results indicated that the film with 90/10 PVA/CS and 7.0% loading of NCC-cych-HDH-Cl exhibited excellent tensile strength. The antibacterial film with 5.91x10(17) atoms/cm(2) of active chlorine displayed an excellent antibacterial property against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43895).

Researchers are constantly developing new biomaterials and tissue-engineered technologies to stimulate tissue regeneration. Various emerging approaches according to organ, tissue, disease and disorder are identified. Irrespective, engineered biomaterials are required to regenerate and ultimately reproduce the original physiological, biological, chemical, and mechanical properties. Biodegradable materials have been used extensively as regenerative therapies. The selection, design, biological and physicochemical properties of these materials are important and must be considered for stimulating tissue growth.

For this reason, chitosan-based biomaterials have been developed over the years and, among these biomaterials, chitosan-based nanomaterials may significantly change the material properties, which could result in some exceptional features. Indeed, chitosan-based nanofibers have a larger surface area:volume ratio than the bulk materials at macro scale. Moreover, chitosan-based nanofibers could lead to enhanced porosity and mechanical properties, which could also improve surface functionalities, and consequently, the range of applications. However, the diversity in sources of raw materials and the production processes for the development of chitosan might provide distinct physicochemical characteristics. Because the varieties of chitosan have been limited in the most part the nanofibers synthesis, the current review describes an extensive research concerning the development of chitosan-based nanofibers and summarizes the different techniques for the nanofibers production; in addition to point out the effects of chitosan characteristics on the spinnability of the solution. Furthermore, the present review explores some potential studies in relation to the chitosan-based nanofibers applied to food technology, including active food packaging, nanofood carrier and enzyme immobilization.

High oxidative stress at heart tissues post MI is considered one of the important factors damaging transplanted cells and native cells/tissues. Here, we employed an in vitro co-culture system, capable of mimicking cases of stem cell transplantation into the myocardium presenting high oxidative stress, using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) encapsulated in alginate or cell interactive Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-modified alginate micro-hydrogels. Under H2O2-induced oxidative stress conditions, viabilities of hMSCs and CMs were significantly higher in their co-culture than in their individual monolayer cultures. Expression of cardiac muscle markers remained high even with H2O2 treatment when cardiomyocytes (CMs) were co-cultured with hMSCs in RGD-alginate. Higher levels of various growth factors (associated with angiogenesis, cardiac regeneration, and contractility) were found in co-culture (noticeably with RGD-alginate) compared to monolayer cultures of CMs or hMSCs. These results can benefit the study of in vivo MI progression with transplanted stem cells and the development of effective stem cell-based therapeutic strategies for various oxidative stress-related diseases.

This study developed scaffolds materials with microspheres with a purpose of forming a controlled slow release secondary structure. O-CMCS were used as drug carrier to construct the compound sustained-release system with rhBMP-2 and VEGF double factors release. The O-CMCS were loaded with rhBMP-2 and the hydroxyapatite collagen (HC) scaffolds were loaded with VEGF to prepare the scaffolds.

The effect of functionalised nano particles on triple helical conformational changes in collagen has not been understood well. For understanding the role of functionalization on collagen conformation, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) prepared through wet chemical methods and functionalized with organic molecules (F-AuNP5) such as self-assembled monolayer (SAM), (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), Polysaccharides (pectin and chitosan) and Poly(amido amine) PAMAM dendrimer (Go), were characterised and their interaction with collagen was studied. Protein conformational changes assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) reveals that triple helical conformation of collagen was retained in presence of functionalized gold nanoparticle. The biocompatibility of functionalized gold nano particle was analysed against keratinocytes (HaCaT) cell by using (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) KIT assay. The result suggested that dendrimer functionalized gold nanopartide exhibited higher cell viability when compared to other molecules functionalized gold nanoparticles studied. Based on the outcome of this study it can be envisioned that dendrimer functionalized gold nanoparticle mediated collagen materials are highly suitable for tissue engineering and cosmetic application.

Inspired by versatility of mussel adhesive proteins, we developed an ultrafast and accessible route to accelerate effectively the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), the precursor phase of bone-like apatite, on the surface of polydopamine (PDA)-coated tricalcium silicate (TCS) within 5 min in simulated body fluid (SBF). The key of the method lies in successful preparation of PDA coating on the surface of hydrated TCS by simple dip-coating of hydrated TCS in an aqueous solution of dopamine. A strong adsorption between PDA coating and surface of hydrated TCS could be formed via bidentate hydrogen and electrostatic bonds. After 7 d of soaking in SBF, the bone-like apatite layer on the surface of PDA-coated TCS disk, about 91.1 mu m in height was thicker than that on the surface of pristine TCS disk, determining about 49.5 mu m. The results indicate that PDA coating can facilitate the kinetic deposition of bone-like apatite on its surface. The abundant Ca2+ ions and the lower interface energy of ACP at the interface between ACP and surfaces of PDA-coated TCS disks are responsible for the ultrafast precipitation of ACP and formation of bone-like apatite layer which is carbonated hydroxyapatite (HA) confirmed by different analytical tools. The route can open avenues for development of PDA-coated TCS biomaterials for hard tissue repair and substitution.","[Wu, Meng; Wang, Tao; Wang, Yangyang; Wang, Hui] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China","Wang, T (reprint author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",taowang@nuaa.edu.cn,,,Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,This research was funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.,,54,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-8842,1873-3956,,CERAM INT,Ceram.

The present study attempts to investigate the influence of Zr on the overall mechanical and functional responses of a Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr-O alloy in contrast to a new Ti-Nb-Ta-O alloy. In each material, different crystallographic textures were produced by varying the processing route. While both alloys were found to show low elastic modulus values due to their beta-only microstructures, Ti-Nb-Ta-O alloy had lower elastic modulus because of its favorable crystallographic orientation caused by absence of Zr. The tensile strength values were remarkably high for both due to the presence of interstitial oxygen. The hardening effect of Zr was also evident from the higher strength of Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr-O as compared to Ti-Nb-Ta-O alloy. Although the corrosion resistance and in vitro biological behavior of the two alloys were satisfactory, the Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr-O alloy showed lower corrosion rate and improved osteoblast attachment than the Ti-Nb-Ta-Oalloy. Thus, whereas the two alloys show promising performance in terms of their mechanical and functional response, presence of Zr marginally improves the performance in the Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr-O for orthopedic applications.

Its excellent biocompatibility and bio-functions related to tissue regeneration encourage the development of HA-based hydrogels to expand its applications. This study details an in situ forming surgical glue based on photocrosslinkable HA, providing tunable mechanical properties and firm tissue adhesion under wet and dynamic conditions. Depending on the degree of photocrosslinkable methacrylate groups in HA polymer chains, the mechanical properties of hyaluronate methacrylate (HAMA) hydrogels prepared by UV photocrosslinking was improved. Ex vivo adhesion tests revealed that HAMA hydrogels exhibited 3-fold higher shear adhesive strength compared to gelatin methacryloyl hydrogels and achieved firm adherence to the porcine skin tissue for several weeks. The high adhesive strength of HAMA hydrogels, under dry and wet conditions, suggests that it may have great promise as a tissue adhesive. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

To address this, layer-by-layer desolvation (LbL desolvation), a more efficient technique, was developed with PLGA microspheres as sacrificial templates. Due to high efficiency of desolvation in increasing the shell thickness, self-supporting structures were obtained with merely seven silk layers. Permeability of the microcapsules was manipulated with high efficiency as well. Moreover, crosslinking was found to reduce surface charge of the shell. We attributed this to crosslinking-induced conformational change of silk fibroin based on secondary structure analysis. The LbL desolvation technique will facilitate fabrication of multilayer silk microcapsules for biomedical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One efficient technique to achieve substantially lowered friction at the nanoscale, as well as superlubricity in some instances, was investigated with the coupling of ultrasonic actuation of the sliding contact in an atomic force microscope (AFM). Despite the successful application of ultrasonic AFM methods in achieving mechanical property measurements and nanoscale subsurface imaging of soft and hard materials, the mechanism of friction reduction in the microscopic contact and the influence of the ultrasonic parameters on friction reduction are still elusive. In this study, the effects of excitation amplitude, applied normal force, tip radius, and humidity on friction have been investigated in detail. Ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM) results are compared against those collected with conventional contact-AFM (C-AFM) and indicate that a reduction in the adhesive interaction between the tip and sample, as well as a reduction in the shear strength can explain the mechanisms of the friction reduction in UFM method. This study opens up a new door for the control of friction and wear, which is critical for the increased lifetime of AFM probes, N-/MEMS devices and would potentially bridge the gap between nanotribology and other fields, such as nanomachining, nanolithography and biomaterials imaging.","[Sharahi, Hossein Jiryaei; Egberts, Philip; Kim, Seonghwan] Univ Calgary, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Kim, S (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",sskim@ucalgary.ca,"Kim, Seonghwan/J-6884-2012; Sheikhlou, Mehrdad/Z-1545-2018","Kim, Seonghwan/0000-0001-7735-3582; ",Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary; Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Calgary; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF); Canada Research Chairs (CRC) program; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI),"The authors are very grateful for the support from the Schulich School of Engineering and the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Calgary, as well as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF).

Detailed structural characterization was carried out by means of FTIR and H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the antioxidant property against hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and DPPH radicals was evaluated in vitro. 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl)-6-O-(2-aminobenzimidazole)acetyl chitosan chloride (2NPhMC) and 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl)-6-O-(1-butylimidazole) acetyl chitosan chloride (NBMC) showed more than 90% scavenging indices at 1.6 mg/mL. Besides, the antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea and Gibberella zeae was estimated using in vitro MIC and hypha measurements. Most of the quaternized chitosan derivatives especially with the long length alkyl chain and primary amino group showed an inhibitory index of > 85% at 1.0 mg/mL against Botrytis cinerea. Besides, the cytotoxicity of chitosan and all the quaternized chitosan derivatives was evaluated in vitro on HaCaT cells and all the quaternized chitosan derivatives bearing 6-O-imidazole exhibited low cytotoxicity. These results suggested that chitosan derivatives bearing 6-O-imidazole-based quaternary ammonium salts may be used as good biomaterials.","[Wei, Lijie; Li, Qing; Chen, Yuan; Zhang, Jingjing; Mi, Yingqi; Dong, Fang; Guo, Zhanyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Key Lab Coastal Biol & Bioresource Utilizat, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China; [Wei, Lijie; Chen, Yuan; Zhang, Jingjing; Mi, Yingqi; Guo, Zhanyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Lei, Chunqing] Yantai Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Yantai 264005, Peoples R China","Guo, ZY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Key Lab Coastal Biol & Bioresource Utilizat, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China.",zhanyongguo@hotmail.com,"cai, yuanyuan/C-6301-2014",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41576156]; seed project of Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences [YIC Y755031011]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China [ZR 2017BD015]; Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of Chinese Academy of sciences [KFJ-STSZDTP-023]","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41576156), the seed project of Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. YIC Y755031011), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China (ZR 2017BD015), and Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of Chinese Academy of sciences (KFJ-STSZDTP-023) for financial support of this work.",,46,0,0,24,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8617,1879-1344,,CARBOHYD POLYM,Carbohydr.

In this work, we developed a highly efficient near-infrared-NIR-) and pH-responsive carboxymethyl chitosan-functionalized reduced graphene oxide/aldehyde functionalized poly (ethylene glycol) (CMC-rGO/CHO-PEG) hydrogel, which exhibits outstanding delivery performance of antitumor drug, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). CMC was functionalized on the GO nanosheets via a controllable approach in order to achieve strong NIR absorption property and good distribution of rGO. The intercalation effect of CMC-rGO complex improved rGO distribution in the 3D hydrogel, contributing to the enhanced photothermal performance of CMC-rGO/CHO-PEG hydrogel. Furthermore, potential utilization of these CMC-rGO/CHO-PEG hydrogel for drug loading was studied, which provided pH-sensitive release of DOX payload. Particularly, DOX could be released in a more efficient way under acidic environment (pH = 6.5) than that under physiological environment (pH = 7.4). Therefore, this rGO hybridized PEG hydrogel holds strategic potential as a novel drug release platform for combined chem-photothermal therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Among functional polymers, poly-N(isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) allows surface properties to be changed depending on the temperature, with a transition of its properties that occurs around 32 degrees C, called the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This transition is expected to modify surface interactions. Alginate and chitosan are biocompatible polymers commonly combined as polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) and are suitable for wound dressing applications. As a complex system, however, it is not so trivial to achieve an efficient functionalization. Herein, we elaborated a procedure to functionalize the surface of alginate/chitosan PECs without altering their intrinsic properties. FTIR revealed that acidic treatment led to a partial decomplexation of the PECs. Therefore, while the N-Hydroxysuccinimide/N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (NHS/EDC) coupling usually requires an intermediate pH, we showed that a preliminary acidification seemed to increase the surface grafting efficiency. Water contact angle increased from 51 degrees to 72 degrees, showing that PNIPAM enhanced the surface hydro-phobicity. The LCST transition modified the interaction forces between PNIPAM and model surfaces: it revealed an unexpected thermosensitive behaviour as hydrophobic transition favoured interactions with hydrophilic surfaces. It was presumably due to PNIPAM/PEC substrate interactions. Finally, the surface modification did not affect the release properties of the PEC biomaterial.","[Conzatti, G.; Ayadi, F.; Cavalie, S.; Tourrette, A.] Univ Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CIRIMAT, Toulouse, France; [Carrere, N.] Univ Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Ctr Rech Cancerol Toulouse, INSERM, Toulouse, France; [Carrere, N.] CHU Toulouse, Gastrointestinal Surg Dept, Purpan Hosp, Toulouse, France","Tourrette, A (reprint author), Univ Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CIRIMAT, Toulouse, France.",audrey.tourrette@univ-tlse3.fr,,"Conzatti, Guillaume/0000-0002-8002-5894",French National Research Agency [ANR-14-CE17-0002-01],"The authors would like to thank the French National Research Agency for its financial support (ANR-14-CE17-0002-01, FP-BioPrev project).",,33,0,0,48,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-4332,1873-5584,,APPL SURF SCI,Appl.

The overuse of antibiotics has become a common cause of the emergence of multiple antibiotics-resistant bacteria. Besides, biofilm infections are notoriously difficult to treat, as the biofilm matrix provides physical protection from antibiotic treatment. Recently, nanomaterials with high drug loading capacity, various types of stimuli responsiveness, smart targeting and small-size are able to increase local drug concentration and to escape the capture of macrophages. Especially, the loading of drugs to the nanomaterials enhances chances for macrophage capture which is a serious problem related to interaction with immune system. Phototherapy including photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy has attracted wide attentions in treating infectious diseases as the development of drug-resistant bacteria and bacterial biofilms. In addition, based on the special microenvironment of bacterial infections, various construction and modification methods of nanomaterials showed high efficient antibacterial properties. This review describes the latest advances in the phototherapy strategies to resist resistant bacteria and biofilms related infections.","[Wang, Yuqin; Jin, Yingying; Chen, Wei; Wang, Jingjie; Chen, Hao; Sun, Lin; Li, Xi; Wang, Bailiang] Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Ophthalmol & Optometry, Eye Hosp, Wenzhou 325027, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuqin; Chen, Wei; Chen, Hao; Wang, Bailiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Wenzhou Inst Biomat & Engn, Wenzhou 32500, Peoples R China; [Ji, Jian] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Macromol Synth & Functionalizat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qian] Soochow Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, State & Local Joint Engn Lab Novel Funct Polymer, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Shen, Liyan] Wenzhou Med Univ, Key Lab Orthoped Zhejiang Prov, Dept Orthoped, Affiliated Hosp 2, Wenzhou 325027, Peoples R China; [Shen, Liyan] Wenzhou Med Univ, Yuying Childrens Hosp, Wenzhou 325027, Peoples R China","Wang, BL (reprint author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Ophthalmol & Optometry, Eye Hosp, Wenzhou 325027, Peoples R China.",wangbailiang2006@aliyun.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31771026, 81771984, 41506091, 21601139]; National Key RD Program [2016YFC1101201]; Zhejiang National Nature Science Foundation [LQ16B010002]; Medical and health science and technology project of Zhejiang Province [2016YKA139]; Zhejiang provincial Public welfare project [2017C33035]; Science & Technology Program of Wenzhou [Y20160068, Y20160061]","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771026, 81771984, 41506091, 21601139), National Key R&D Program (2016YFC1101201), the Zhejiang National Nature Science Foundation (LQ16B010002), Medical and health science and technology project of Zhejiang Province (2016YKA139), Zhejiang provincial Public welfare project (2017C33035) and Science & Technology Program of Wenzhou (Y20160068, Y20160061) are greatly acknowledged.",,154,2,2,172,172,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

It is generally believed that the high efficiency of lysozyme in inhibiting gram-positive bacteria is caused by its ability to cleave the beta-(1,4)-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in modifying lysozyme via physical or chemical interactions in order to improve its sensitivity against gram-negative bacterial strains. This review addresses some significant techniques, including sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), infrared (IR) spectra, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), UV-vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectra and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which can be used to characterize lysozymes and methods that modify lysozymes with carbohydrates to enhance their various physicochemical characteristics.

Facile fabrication of ultrathin monolayer PDMS nanobrush on an underlying substrate facilitated regaining cell adhesion through long-range cell attractive forces such as the van der Waals forces. We showed that cell adhesion is diminished by increasing the number of nanobrush layers, causing a gradual decrease of the effectiveness of the long-range force.

The effects of spraying conditions on the martensitic transformation were investigated in three heat-affected zones: the zone under the handle, the transition zone and in a representative zone with HAp coverage. In the representative area, a reduction in the amount of non-transformable phases was observed. A part of the sublayer showed a nanocrystalline or completely amorphous structure. This sublayer was approximately 30 mu m thick. Structural changes contributed to the reduction of the temperature of the reverse martensitic transition down to 25 degrees C. Moreover, modification of the surface revealed a positive influence on the transformation course by narrowing its temperature range and increasing its enthalpy.","[Goryczka, Tomasz; Zubko, Maciej] Univ Silesia Katowice, Inst Mat Sci, Ul 75 Pulk Piechoty 1A, PL-41500 Chorzow, Poland; [Dudek, Agata] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Inst Mat Engn, Czestochowa, Poland","Goryczka, T (reprint author), Univ Silesia Katowice, Inst Mat Sci, Ul 75 Pulk Piechoty 1A, PL-41500 Chorzow, Poland.",tomasz.goryczka@us.edu.pl,,,,,,24,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-0836,1743-2847,,MATER SCI TECH-LOND,Mater.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) investigations proved the higher thermal stability and successful entrapment of oxaliplatin (OXP) in the polymeric network. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the loss in crystallinity of the drug after loading in the hydrogel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the porous surface of the hydrogel.

The in-vitro enzymatic degradation study showed that the blank hydrogels were more stable against the blank PBS than the collagenase and lysozyme. MIT-assay proved that the blank hydrogels were cyto-compatible while free OXP as well as OXP-loaded hydrogels showed dose dependent controlled cytotoxicity against Vero, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines.

Several studies have also suggested that zol has direct anti-tumor activity. Systemic administration at high doses is the current approach to deliver zol, yet it has been associated with debilitating side effects. Local therapeutic delivery offers the ability to administer much lower total dosage, while at the same time maintaining sustained high-local drug concentration directly at the target treatment site. Here, we aimed to assess effects of lower doses of zol on bone metastases over a longer time.MethodsProstate cancer cell line LAPC4 and prostate-induced bone metastasis cells were treated with zol at 1, 3 and 10 mu M for 7days. Following treatment, cell proliferation was assessed using Almarblue((R)), Vybrant MTT (R), and Live/Dead((R)) viability/cytotoxicity assays. Additionally, cell migration and invasion were carried out using Falcon cell culture inserts and Cultrex((R)) 3D spheroid cell invasion assays respectively.ResultsWe show that treatment with 3-10 mu M zol over 7-days significantly decreased cell proliferation in both the prostate cancer cell line LAPC4 and cells from spine metastases secondary to prostate cancer. Using the same low-dose and longer time course for treatment, we demonstrate that 10 mu M zol also significantly inhibits tumor cell migration and 3D-cell growth/invasion.ConclusionsThis project harnesses the potential of using zol at low doses for longer treatment periods, which may be a viable treatment modality when coupled with biomaterials or biodevices for local delivery.","[Akoury, Elie; Ahangar, Pouyan; Nour, Antone; Haglund, Lisbet; Rosenzweig, Derek H.; Weber, Michael H.] McGill Univ, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Akoury, Elie; Ahangar, Pouyan; Nour, Antone; Haglund, Lisbet; Rosenzweig, Derek H.; Weber, Michael H.] McGill Univ, Hlth Ctr, Res Inst, Injury Repair Recovery Program, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lapointe, Jacques; Guerard, Karl-Philippe] McGill Univ, Dept Surg, Div Urol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lapointe, Jacques; Guerard, Karl-Philippe] McGill Univ, Hlth Ctr, Res Inst, Canc Res Program, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Rosenzweig, DH; Weber, MH (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Surg, Div Orthopaed, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Rosenzweig, DH; Weber, MH (reprint author), McGill Univ, Hlth Ctr, Res Inst, Injury Repair Recovery Program, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",derek.rosenzweig@mcgill.ca; michael.weber@hotmail.com,,,AO Start-Up Grant [S-16-138W]; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC); MITACs Accelerate program; RI-MUHC,"This research was funded by AO Start-Up Grant Number S-16-138W to MHW, and by internal start-up funding from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) to DHR.

The physical properties of the hydrogels were investigated by rheology, scanning electron microscopy, swelling tests, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and model drug loading and release assays. Hydrogel properties depended on the generation number of the denELP, which contained structural segments based on the repeating GLPGL pentamer. Hydrogels with higher generation denELPs (G2 and 3) showed similar properties, but those prepared from G1 denELPs were rheologically weaker, had a larger mesh size, absorbed less model drug, and released the drug more quickly. Interestingly, most of the HA_denELP hydrogels studied here remained transparent upon gelation, but after lyophilization and addition of water retained opaque, ""solid-like'' regions for up to 4 d during rehydration. This rehydration process was carefully evaluated through time-course SAXS studies, and the phenomenon was attributed to the formation of pre-coacervates in the gel-forming step, which slowly swelled in water during rehydration. These findings provide important insights into the behavior of ELP-based hydrogels, in which physical crosslinking of the ELP domains can be controlled to tune mechanical properties, highlighting the potential of HA_denELP hydrogels as biomaterials.","[Shmidov, Yulia; Yosefi, Gal; Bitton, Ronit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Chem Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shmidov, Yulia; Yosefi, Gal; Bitton, Ronit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilze Katz Inst Nanoscale Sci & Technol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Zhou, Mingjun; Matson, John B.] Virginia Tech, Dept Chem, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Zhou, Mingjun; Matson, John B.] Virginia Tech, Macromol Innovat Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Bitton, R (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Chem Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.; Bitton, R (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilze Katz Inst Nanoscale Sci & Technol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.; Matson, JB (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Dept Chem, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.; Matson, JB (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Macromol Innovat Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",rbitton@bgu.ac.il; jbmatson@vt.edu,,"Bitton, Ronit/0000-0001-9601-9926; Matson, John/0000-0001-7984-5396",United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2016096]; Joseph and May Winston Career Development Chair in Chemical Engineering; Fralin Life Science Institute at Virginia Tech,"The work was supported by the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (2016096).

Herein, we demonstrate the facile preparation of a novel class of hybrid particles of tunable morphology, chemical composition and structure. These hybrid particles (i) release alendronate and various inorganic elements (Ca, Na, Si, and P) in a controlled manner, (ii) exhibit a strong anti-osteoclastic effect in vitro, and (iii) stimulate regeneration of osteoporotic bone in vivo.

It is additionally advantageous if such materials resembled the structural and biochemical features of the natural extracellular environment. Here, we show a novel modular design strategy to engineer biomimetic carbon fiber based scaffolds. Highly porous ceramic zinc oxide (ZnO) microstructures serve as three-dimensional (3D) sacrificial templates and are infiltrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene dispersions. Once the CNTs and graphene coat the ZnO template, the ZnO is either removed by hydrolysis or converted into carbon by chemical vapor deposition. The resulting 3D carbon scaffolds are both hierarchically ordered and free-standing. The properties of the microfibrous scaffolds were tailored with a high porosity (up to 93%), a high Young's modulus (ca. 0.027-22 MPa), and an electrical conductivity of ca. 0.1-330 S/m, as well as different surface compositions. Cell viability, fibroblast proliferation rate and protein adsorption rate assays have shown that the generated scaffolds are biocompatible and have a high protein adsorption capacity (up to 77.32 +/- 6.95 mg/cm(3)) so that they are able to resemble the extracellular matrix not only structurally but also biochemically. The scaffolds also allow for the successful growth and adhesion of fibroblast cells, showing that we provide a novel, highly scalable modular design strategy to generate biocompatible carbon fiber systems that mimic the extracellular matrix with the additional feature of conductivity.","[Taale, Mohammadreza; Selhuber-Unkel, Christine] Univ Kiel, Inst Mat Sci, Biocompatible Nanomat, Kaiserstr 2, D-24143 Kiel, Germany; [Schuett, Fabian; Mishra, Yogendra Kumar; Adelung, Rainer] Univ Kiel, Inst Mat Sci, Funct Nanomat, Kaiserstr 2, D-24143 Kiel, Germany; [Carey, Tian; Torrisi, Felice] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Graphene Ctr, 9 JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England; [Marx, Janik; Fiedler, Bodo] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Polymer & Composites, Denickestr 15, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany; [Stock, Norbert] Univ Kiel, Inst Inorgan Chem, Max Eyth Str 2, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Selhuber-Unkel, C (reprint author), Univ Kiel, Inst Mat Sci, Biocompatible Nanomat, Kaiserstr 2, D-24143 Kiel, Germany.",cse@tf.uni-kiel.de,,"Selhuber-Unkel, Christine/0000-0002-5051-4822; Torrisi, Felice/0000-0002-6144-2916","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR2093]; European Union [GrapheneCore2 785219]; European Research Council (ERC) [StG 336104 CELLINSPIRED, PoC 768740 CHANNELMAT]; German Research Foundation [RTG 2154, SFB 1261]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [91526555-57048249]; EPSRC [EP/P02534X/1]; ERC [319277]; Trinity College, Cambridge; Isaac Newton Trust","RA. gratefully acknowledges partial project funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under contract FOR2093.

For cardiovascular abnormalities, precise non-invasive imaging interventions are being used to develop patient specific diagnosis and surgical planning. Concurrently, pre surgical 3D simulation and computational modeling are aiding in the effective surgery and understanding of valve biomechanics, respectively. Consequently, 3D printing of patient specific valves that can mimic the original one will become an effective outbreak for valvular problems. Printing of these patient-specific tissues or organ components is becoming a viable option owing to the advances in biomaterials and additive manufacturing techniques. These additive manufacturing techniques are receiving a full-fledged support from burgeoning field of computational fluid dynamics, digital image processing, artificial intelligence, and continuum mechanics during their optimization and implementation. Further, studies at cellular and molecular biomechanics have enriched our understanding of biomechanical factors resulting in valvular heart diseases. Hence, the knowledge generated can guide us during the design and synthesis of biomaterials to develop superior extra cellular matrix, mimicking materials that can be used as a bioink for 3D printing of organs and tissues. With this notion, we have reviewed current opportunities and challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of heart valve abnormalities through patient-specific valve design via tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting. These valves can replace diseased valves by preserving homogeneity and individuality of the patients.","[Vashistha, Rajat; Chhabra, Deepak] Maharshi Dayanand Univ, Univ Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Optimizat & Mech Lab, Rohtak, Haryana, India; [Kumar, Prasoon] Natl Inst Pharmaceut Educ & Res Ahmadabad, Dept Med Devices, Gandhinagar 382355, Gujarat, India; [Sharma, Naveen] Shalby Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Jabalpur, India; [Shukla, Pratyoosh] Maharshi Dayanand Univ, Dept Microbiol, Enzyme Technol & Prot Bioinformat Lab, Rohtak 124001, Haryana, India","Shukla, P (reprint author), Maharshi Dayanand Univ, Dept Microbiol, Enzyme Technol & Prot Bioinformat Lab, Rohtak 124001, Haryana, India.",pratyoosh.shukla@gmail.com,,"Shukla, Pratyoosh/0000-0002-9307-4126","MHRD, Government of India","Authors acknowledge M.D. University Rohtak, India for providing infrastructural facilities.

Engineering surfaces that resist the FBR could lead to enhanced functionality including potentially improving outcomes for cochlear implant recipients through reduction in fibrosis. In this work, we coat poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces with two zwitterionic polymers, poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) and poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA), using a simultaneous photografting/photo-cross-linking process to produce a robust grafted zwitterionic hydrogel. reduce nonspecific protein adsorption, the first step of the FBR. The coating process uses benzophenone, a photografting agent and type II photoinitiator, to covalently link the cross-linked zwitterionic thin film to the PDMS surface. As the concentration of benzophenone on the surface increases, the adhesive strength of the zwitterionic thin films to PDMS surfaces increases as determined by shear adhesion. Additionally, with increased concentration of the adsorbed benzophenone, failure of the system changes from adhesive delamination to cohesive failure within the hydrogel, demonstrating that durable adhesive bonds are formed from the photografting process. Interestingly, antifouling properties of the zwitterionic polymers are preserved with significantly lower levels of nonspecific protein adsorption on zwitterion hydrogel-coated samples compared to uncoated controls. Fibroblast adhesion is also dramatically reduced on coated substrates. These results show that cross-linked pSBMA and pCBMA hydrogels can be readily photografted to PDMS substrates and show promise in potentially changing the fibrotic response to implanted biomaterials.","[Leigh, Braden L.; Derk, Alexis; Guymon, C.

For the prevention of such infections, biomaterial surfaces are chemically or topographically modified to slow down the initial stages of biofilm formation. In the bifunctional material here presented, chemical and topographical cues are combined, so that protein and bacterial adhesion as well as bacterial proliferation are effectively inhibited. Upon changes in the surface topography parameters and investigation of the effect of these changes on bioactivity, structure-property relationships are obtained. The target material is obtained by microcontact printing (mu CP), a soft lithography method. The antimicrobial component, poly(oxanorbornene)-based synthetic mimics of an antimicrobial peptide (SMAMP), was printed onto a protein-repellent polysulfobetaine hydrogel, so that bifunctional 3D structured polymer surfaces with 1, 2, and 8.5 mu m spacing are obtained. These surfaces are characterized with fluorescence microscopy, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and contact angle measurements. Biological studies show that the bifunctional surfaces with 1 and 2 mu m spacing are 100% antimicrobially active against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, 100% fibrinogen-repellent, and nontoxic to human gingival mucosal keratinocytes. At 8.5 mu m spacing, the broad-band antimicrobial activity and the protein repellency are compromised, which indicates that this spacing is above the upper limit for effective simultaneous antimicrobial activity and protein repellency of polyzwitterionic-polycationic materials.","[Widyaya, Vania Tanda; Lienkamp, Karen] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Bioact Polymer Synth & Surface Engn Grp, Georges Kohler Allee 105, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Widyaya, Vania Tanda; Lienkamp, Karen] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Ctr Interact Mat & Bioinspired Technol F, Georges Kohler Allee 105, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Mueller, Claas] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Lab Proc Technol, Georges Kohler Allee 1003, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Al-Ahmad, Ali] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Ctr Dent Med, Dept Operat Dent & Periodontol, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany","Lienkamp, K (reprint author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Bioact Polymer Synth & Surface Engn Grp, Georges Kohler Allee 105, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.; Lienkamp, K (reprint author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Ctr Interact Mat & Bioinspired Technol F, Georges Kohler Allee 105, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",lienkamp@imtek.uni-freiburg.de,,"Lienkamp, Karen/0000-0001-6868-3707","Ministry for Science, Research and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany (GenMik I + II graduate school); European Research Council (ERC-StG REGENERATE)","Funding of this work by the Ministry for Science, Research and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany (GenMik I + II graduate school), and the European Research Council (ERC-StG REGENERATE) is gratefully acknowledged.

However, a widely used biomaterial such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) suffers from high biofouling activity and hydrophobic recovery that results in decreased efficiency and stability. A current challenge is to modify and fabricate self-cleaning PDMS surfaces by incorporating antifouling and pH-sensitive properties. To address this, we synthesized a zwitterionic and pH-sensitive random poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-sulfobetaine methacrylate-co-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) polymer, poly(GMA-co-SBMA-co-DMAEMA). In this work, chemical modification of PDMS was done by grafting onto poly(GMA-co-SBMA-co-DMAEMA) after surface activation via UV and ozone for 90 min to ensure the formation of covalent bonds necessary for stable grafting. The PDMS grafted with G20-S40-D40 exhibit antifouling and pH-sensitive properties by mitigating fibrinogen adsorption, blood cell adhesion, and releasing 98% adhered E. coli bacteria after immersion at basic pH. The grafting of poly(GMA-co-SBMA-co-DMAEMA) presented in this work shows attractive potential for biomedical and industrial applications as a simple, smart, and effective method for the modification of PDMS interfaces.","[De Vera, Jacqueline S.; Venault, Antoine; Chou, Ying-Nien; Chang, Yung] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, R&D Ctr Membrane Technol, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [De Vera, Jacqueline S.; Venault, Antoine; Chou, Ying-Nien; Chang, Yung] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [De Vera, Jacqueline S.; Tayo, Lemmuel] Mapua Univ, Sch Chem Biol & Mat Engn & Sci, Muralla St, Manila 1002, Philippines; [Chiang, Heng-Chieh] Changhua Christian Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Urol, 135 Nanxian St, Changhua 500, Taiwan; [Aimar, Pierre] Univ Paul Sabatier, Lab Genie Chim, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France","Chang, Y (reprint author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, R&D Ctr Membrane Technol, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.; Chang, Y (reprint author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",ychang@cycu.edu.tw,,"Venault, Antoine/0000-0002-0383-695X",project of Outstanding Professor Research Program at Chung Yuan Christian University; Ministry of Science and Technology and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (MOST-ANR International Program) [MOST 107-2923-E-033-001]; Changhua Christian Hospital [1060526],"The authors would like to acknowledge the project of Outstanding Professor Research Program at Chung Yuan Christian University, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (MOST-ANR International Program: MOST 107-2923-E-033-001), and the Changhua Christian Hospital (1060526) for their financial support.",,51,0,0,12,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,FEB 5,2019,35,5,,,SI,,1357.0,1368,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b01569,,,,12,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,HK8DU,WOS:000458220400031,30089354.0,,,,2019-02-25

However, the hydrophobic monomers to be copolymerized with MPC have not been optimized for PTX solubilization and its dosage forms. Here, we show the enhanced PTX solubility by only an MPC-based amphiphilic copolymer using a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) methacrylate (MA) bearing an ethyl (C2H5) group as a vertex group. MPC was copolymerized with POSS methacrylates bearing different vertex groups of ethyl (C2H5), hexyl (C6H13), and octyl (C8H17) via radical polymerization. We found that the strong interaction between C2H5-POSS and PTX contributed to the slow release of PTX without any burst release. The C2H5-POSS-MA MPC copolymer was internalized into the cultured HeLa cells, which was confirmed by using a fluorescein-4-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled PTX, and the PTX-dissolved copolymer induced cell death.

To reduce the risk of infections, in this work, a new approach which makes use of a bioinspired coating with dual antimicrobial and antifouling functions was developed through rapid deposition of functional polydopamine (pDA) and antimicrobial copper ions, and subsequent conjugation of zwitterionic antifouling sulfobetaine (SB) moieties by the aza-Michael addition reaction. pDA permits surface-independent versatile functionalization on a variety of substrates, such as TiO2, SiO2, gold, plastics, and Nitinol alloy. The characterizations for chemical elemental compositions and hydrophilicity by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle goniometer, respectively, indicating the successful grafting of SB moieties and the presence of copper ions in the pDA adlayers. Ellipsometric thicknesses of the thin films were followed to monitor the formation of pDA films and the changes after the post conjugation. UV-vis spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed the coordination structure of catechol-Cu, and release profile of Cu2+ from the constructed functional coatings. The superhydrophilic and charge-balanced SB interface allowed effective resistance of bacterial adsorption. Intriguingly, we scrutinized that the release of bactericidal copper ions enables killing the residual amount of adsorbed bacteria. Moreover, viability tests for fibroblast cells indicate the excellent biocompatibility of the developed medical coatings. For real world implementation, the antifouling and antimicrobial coatings were applied on commercially available silicone-based urinary catheters, and the existence of bacteria was evaluated by using the plate-counting assay. The results showed an undetectable level of living bacteria. Consequently, the dual functional medical coating offers a promising approach to eliminate BAIs for practical applications.","[Fan, Yu-Jhen; Minh Tan Pham; Huang, Chun-Jen] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Biomed Sci & Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [Huang, Chun-Jen] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan","Huang, CJ (reprint author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Biomed Sci & Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.; Huang, CJ (reprint author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",cjhuang@ncu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 105-2628-E-008-007-MY3, 106-2119-M-194-002]",The authors acknowledge the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 105-2628-E-008-007-MY3; 106-2119-M-194-002) for financial support of this project.,,61,1,1,20,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,FEB 5,2019,35,5,,,SI,,1642.0,1651,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b01730,,,,10,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Materials Science,HK8DU,WOS:000458220400061,30114915.0,,,,2019-02-25

However, it still remains unclear about how mechanical properties of zwitterionic hydrogels affect their antifouling property. In this work, we propose a simple, thermal-pretreatment method to fabricate poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) hydrogels with varied mechanical properties that can be readily tuned by thermal pretreatment time and cross-linker density, as well as to correlate their mechanical property with antifouling property. The resulting thermal-treated pSBMA hydrogels show significantly enhanced mechanical properties with tunable compressive modulus and elastic modulus as compared to the untreated hydrogels. A combination of ELISA investigations and short-term cell adhesion assays also confirm that pSBMA hydrogels exhibit superior antifouling properties to resist protein adsorption and cell adhesion. Further analysis shows a linear inversion correlation between elastic modulus and protein adsorption of pSBMA hydrogels, i.e., the hydrogel with the higher elastic modulus exhibits the lower protein adsorption (the better antifouling property). This work not only provides a simple thermal-pretreatment strategy for fabricating pSBMA hydrogels, but also demonstrates multifunctional properties of the pSBMA hydrogels, which possess a great potential to fulfill some biomedical applications.","[He, Huacheng] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Engn, Wenzhou 325027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Xuan; Zhang, Cuiyun; Song, Yi; Wu, Jiang] Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shengfu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Chem & Biol Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gong, Xiong] Univ Akron, Coll Polymer Sci & Polymer Engn, Dept Polymer Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Ren, Baiping; Zheng, Jie] Univ Akron, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Wu, J (reprint author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Zheng, J (reprint author), Univ Akron, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",zhengj@uakron.edu; woody870402@hotmail.com,"Wu, Jiang/X-1432-2018; He, Huacheng/F-1941-2018","Wu, Jiang/0000-0003-1929-3328; He, Huacheng/0000-0001-5177-0636","Natural Science Foundation of China [81701809, 81601615]; Zhejiang Educational Committee of China [Y201737074]; Wenzhou Science & Technology Bureau of China [Y20170157]; NSF [CMMI-1825122, DMR-1607475]","H.H. and J.W. acknowledge financial support from Natural Science Foundation of China (81701809 and 81601615).

Heating collapses the flexible network, which generates internal stress that causes the hybrid gel to stiffen up to 50 times its original modulus; an effect that is instantaneous and fully reversible. The average generated forces amount to similar to 1 pN per network fibre, which are similar to values found for stiffening resulting from myosin molecular motors in actin.

The layer-by-layer assembly is one of powerful tools to realize such controlled release system because of the ability to easily incorporate biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, and peptides within the film in mild aqueous conditions and those multilayered films undergo gradual disassembly under physiological conditions. However, it has been regarded as a challenging task to prevent the initial burst release of active agents as the multilayer films are immediately degraded from the early stage. In the present study, in order to prevent such an initial fast release, we have employed cylindrical porous structures since the effective diffusion coefficient of a solute within pores is known to be lower than the value in the bulk state, resulting from hydrodynamic and entropic restriction on the solutes due to the presence of pore walls. By varying the pore size of porous membranes, we could modulate the release kinetics of a model protein incorporated within multilayered films, allowing the release of proteins in a more sustained manner when compare with the release from a flat substrate without any additional controlled parameters.","[Cho, Younghyun] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Energy Syst, Asan 31538, South Korea; [Hong, Jinkee] Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea","Cho, Y (reprint author), Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Energy Syst, Asan 31538, South Korea.; Hong, J (reprint author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",yhcho@sch.ac.kr; jinkee.hong@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Soonchunhyang University Research Fund; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2017R1E1A1A01074343],"This work was also supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.

The dependence of corrosion properties and hydrogen evolution with alloy compositions, sizes and kinds of microstructure was exhaustively analyzed. The results were compared with amorphous alloys of same compositions. Zn-rich composition with average grain sizes of less than 500 nm presented marginal and an acceptable level of hydrogen, which was lower than for larger grains or Zn-poor composition. This behavior was explained by the reduction of the intrinsic metallic surface reactivity and the higher stability of the oxide film, which reduce the corrosion rate and, consequently, the hydrogen evolution. Mg-Zn-Ca crystalline alloys with Zn-alloying threshold and homogeneous grain size (<500 nm) appear hence to be of great potential for use in biodegradable implants. (C)2018 Elsevier B.V.

Different kinetics and mechanisms of the alloys' degradation were identified, influencing their corrosion rates' dynamics. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, being performed for up to 3 days, revealed that the corrosion of all three alloys are under a kinetic-controlled mechanism, among which only pure Mg and Mg-4Ag show a repassivation ability in this time-frame. However, the corrosion rates of binary alloys after 28 days of incubation reaching a value of around 0.33 mm/y and a release of 64 mg/L Mg2+ ions, that was accompanied by a pH change up to 8.3, an be lower compared to the pure Mg alloy (0.62 mm/y, 117 mg/L of Mg2+, pH of 9.0). While thick and homogenous layers of differently-shaped and chemically secondary-phased Mg(OH) 2 products were identified on both binary alloys, MgO products and an apatite structure are formed on the pure Mg alloy surface. The Mg-4Ag alloy seems to be bio-medically the most appropriate regarding the in-vitro degradation process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we propose an environmentally friendly substrate based on silver-plated cicada wings with seamless graphene layer (GrAgNPs-C.w.), which can be prepared with a simple and inexpensive method. Compared with AgNPs-C.w., Gr-AgNPs-C.w. hybrids show better SERS performance with high sensitivity, good uniformity and good stability with R6G detection. The minimum detected concentration can reach 10(-15) M, and the value of R-2 can reach 0.996, respectively. Theoretical simulation demonstrates the situation of electromagnetic field through COMSOL software. In addition, due to the affinity of graphene for biomolecules, we can successfully detect the DNA biomolecules through a simple process. Therefore, this cheap and efficient natural SERS substrate has great potential for a considerable number of biochemical SERS applications and can broaden the way in which multiple SERS platforms derived from other natural materials am prepared.

As a consequence, the reduced calcium ion concentration is known to affect osteoblastic development. Therefore, the main focus was put on the question, whether an increased strontium concentration (in the range of mM) might be suitable to compensate the lack of calcium ions. The effect of solely strontium ions-with only calcium in the media resulting from fetal calf serum-was investigated. Commercially available calcium-free medium (modified alpha-MEM) was tested in comparison with media with varied calcium ion concentrations (0.9, 1.8, and 3.6 mM), or strontium ion concentration (0.4, 0.9, 1.8, and 3.6 mM). In case of calcium, higher concentrations cause increased proliferation, while differentiation was shifted to earlier points of time. Differentiation was increased by solely strontium ions only at 0.4-0.9 mM, while proliferation was highest for 0.9-1.8 mM. From these results, it can be concluded that strontium is able to compensate a lack of calcium to a certain degree. Thus, in contrast to calcium ion release, a strontium ion release from bone substitute materials might be applicable for stimulation of bone regeneration without influencing the media saturation.","[Kruppke, Benjamin; Heinemann, Christiane; Farack, Jana; Wiesmann, Hans-Peter; Hanke, Thomas] Tech Univ Dresden, Max Bergmann Ctr Biomat, Dresden, Germany; [Kruppke, Benjamin; Heinemann, Christiane; Farack, Jana; Wiesmann, Hans-Peter; Hanke, Thomas] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Mat Sci, Dresden, Germany; [Wagner, Alena-Svenja; Wenisch, Sabine] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Vet Anat Histol & Embryol, Clin Small Anim, Giessen, Germany; [Wagner, Alena-Svenja] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Vet Physiol & Biochem, Giessen, Germany","Kruppke, B (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Max Bergmann Ctr Biomat, Dresden, Germany.; Kruppke, B (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Mat Sci, Dresden, Germany.",Benjamin.Kruppke@tu-dresden.de,,"Kruppke, Benjamin/0000-0002-0659-0238","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [107540325 - TRR 79]","Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Projektnummer 107540325 - TRR 79, M3 and B5.",,42,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1592,1440-169X,,DEV GROWTH DIFFER,Dev.

Herein, a small-caliber vascular graft (diameter 2 mm) is fabricated from poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(isobutyl-morpholine-2,5-dione) (PCL-PIBMD) and silk fibroin (SF) by electrospinning technology and then biofunctionalized with low-fouling poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and two cell-adhesive peptide sequences (CREDVW and CAGW) with the purpose of enhancing antithrombogenic activity and endothelialization. The successful grafting of PEG and peptide sequences is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The suitable surface wettability of the modified vascular graft is testified by water contact angle analysis. The surface hemocompatibility is verified by platelet adhesion assays and protein adsorption assays, and the results demonstrate that both platelet adhesion and protein adsorption on the biofunctionalized surface are significantly reduced. In vitro studies demonstrate that the biofunctionalized surface with suitable hydrophilicity and cell-adhesive peptides can selectively promote the adhesion, spreading, and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. More importantly, compared with control groups, this biofunctionalized small-caliber vascular graft shows high long-term patency and endothelialization after 10 weeks of implantation. The biofunctionalization with PEG and two cell-adhesive peptide sequences is an effective method to improve the endothelialization and long-term performance of synthetic vascular grafts.","[Bai, Lingchuang; Zhao, Jing; Li, Qian; Guo, Jintang; Ren, Xiangkui; Feng, Yakai] Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Yaguan Rd 135, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jintang; Ren, Xiangkui; Feng, Yakai] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Chem Engn Tianj, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xiangkui; Feng, Yakai] Tianjin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Bioengn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Xia, Shihai] Logist Univ Peoples Armed Police Force, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Hepatopancreatobiliary & Splen Med, 220 Chenglin Rd, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wencheng] Logist Univ Chinese Peoples Armed Police Force, Dept Physiol & Pathophysiol, Tianjin 300309, Peoples R China","Feng, YK (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Yaguan Rd 135, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.; Feng, YK (reprint author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Chem Engn Tianj, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.; Feng, YK (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Bioengn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",yakaifeng@tju.edu.cn,,"feng, yakai/0000-0002-4511-0874","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC1100300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51673145, 51873149, 21875157, 31370969]; International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China [2013DFG52040]","This project was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC1100300), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51673145, 51873149, 21875157, and 31370969), and International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China (Grant No. 2013DFG52040).",,48,0,0,20,20,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1616-5187,1616-5195,,MACROMOL BIOSCI,Macromol.

Biomaterials-based scaffolds can influence directed cell differentiation to improve cell-based strategies. Using a novel microfluidics approach, poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), is used to fabricate microfibers with varying diameters (3-40 mu m) and topographies (straight and wavy). Multipotent adult rat hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (AHPCs) are cultured on 3D aligned PCL microfibrous scaffolds to investigate their ability to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The results indicate that the PCL microfibers significantly enhance proliferation of the AHPCs compared to control, 2D planar substrates. While the AHPCs maintained their multipotent differentiation capacity when cultured on the PCL scaffolds, there is a significant and dramatic increase in immunolabeling for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation when compared with growth on planar surfaces. Our results show a 3.5-fold increase in proliferation and 23.4-fold increase in astrocyte differentiation for cells on microfibers. Transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells within a PCL microfiber scaffold may provide important biological and topographic cues that facilitate the survival, selective differentiation, and integration of transplanted cells to improve therapeutic strategies.","[Patel, Bhavika B.; Sakaguchi, Donald S.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Patel, Bhavika B.; Sakaguchi, Donald S.] Iowa State Univ, Cell Biol & Neurosci Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Sharifi, Farrokh; Montazami, Reza; Hashemi, Nicole N.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Stroud, Daniel P.; Sakaguchi, Donald S.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Biol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Sakaguchi, DS (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.; Sakaguchi, DS (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Cell Biol & Neurosci Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.; Sakaguchi, DS (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Biol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dssakagu@iastate.edu,,"Hashemi, Nicole/0000-0001-8921-7588; Sakaguchi, Donald/0000-0003-4537-0972","Stem Cell Research Fund; Department of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology; Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N000141612246]; ONR [N000141712620]; Iowa State College of Engineering Exploratory Research Project; US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command","This work was partially supported by the Stem Cell Research Fund, the Department of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Grant N000141612246, ONR Grant N000141712620, Iowa State College of Engineering Exploratory Research Project and US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.

The current golden standard in bio-activation is the combination of a random polymeric catechol (L-DOPA) coating and collagen type IV (Col IV). Here the possibility of replacing this with defined monomeric catechol functionalization on a biomaterial surface using supramolecular ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy)-moieties is investigated. Monomeric catechols modified with a UPy-unit are successfully incorporated and presented in supramolecular UPy-polymer films and membranes. Unfortunately, these UPy-catechols are unable to improve epithelial cell monolayer formation over time, solely or in combination with Col IV. L-DOPA combined with Col IV is able to induce a tight monolayer capable of transport on electrospun supramolecular UPy-membranes. This study shows that a random polymeric catechol coating cannot be simply mimicked by defined monomeric catechols as supramolecular additives. There is still a long way to go in order to synthetically mimic simple natural structures.","[van Gaal, Ronald C.; Fransen, Peter-Paul K. H.; Dankers, Patricia Y.

In this study, an emerging technology, two-photon polymerization, is used to print topological patterns with varying feature-size and thereby study their effect on cellular differentiation. This technique offers rapid manufacturing of topographical surfaces with good feature resolution for shapes smaller than 3 mu m. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells, when attached to these substrates or a non-patterned control for 1 week, express an array of genetic markers that suggest their differentiation toward a heterogeneous population of multipotent progenitors from all three germ layers. Compared to the topographically smooth control, small features (1.6 mu m) encourage differentiation toward ectoderm while large features (8 mu m) inhibit self-renewal. This study demonstrates the potential of using two-photon polymerization to study and control stem cell fate as a function of substrate interactions.

However, mRNA's fast degradation rate and low-transfection efficiency in vivo impede its potential in vaccination. Recent research in gene delivery has focused on nonviral vaccine carriers and either implantable or injectable delivery systems to improve transgene expression in vivo. Here, an injectable chitosan-alginate gel scaffold for the local delivery of mRNA vaccines is reported. Gel scaffold biodegradation rates and biocompatibility are quantified. Scaffold-mediated mRNA in vivo transgene expression as well as ovalbumin antigen specific cellular and humoral immune responses are evaluated in vivo. Luciferase reporter protein expression resulting from mRNA lipoplex-loaded gel scaffolds is five times higher than systemic injection. Compared to systemic injections of naked mRNA or mRNA:lipoplexes, elevated levels of T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion are seen with in vivo scaffold-mediated mRNA lipoplex delivery. Furthermore, a humoral response (ovalbumin antigen specific IgG levels) is observed as early as week 1 for scaffold-mediated mRNA lipoplex delivery, while protein-based immunization did not elicit IgG production until 2 weeks post-injection. Results suggest that injectable scaffold mRNA vaccine delivery maybe a viable alternative to traditional nucleic acid immunization methods.","[Yan, Jingxuan; Chen, Ruying; Zhang, Hong; Bryers, James D.] Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bryers, JD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jbryers@uw.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health/NIAID [5R01AI074661, 2R56AI074661-06]","J.D.B. designed and supervised the overall project conception and execution; and aided in revising the manuscript.

Only environmentally safe construction biotechnologies should be used for such environmental and geotechnical engineering works as control of the seepage in dams, channels, landfills or tunnels, sealing of the channels and the ponds, prevention of soil erosion and soil dust emission, mitigation of soil liquefaction, and immobilization of soil pollutants.","[Ivanov, Volodymyr; Stabnikov, Viktor; Stabnikova, Olena] Natl Univ Food Technol, Dept Biotechnol & Microbiol, 68 Volodymyrska St, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine; [Ivanov, Volodymyr; Stabnikov, Viktor; Stabnikova, Olena] Natl Univ Food Technol, Adv Res Lab, 68 Volodymyrska St, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine; [Kawasaki, Satoru] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Engn, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan","Ivanov, V (reprint author), Natl Univ Food Technol, Dept Biotechnol & Microbiol, 68 Volodymyrska St, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine.; Ivanov, V (reprint author), Natl Univ Food Technol, Adv Res Lab, 68 Volodymyrska St, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine.",cvivanov@nuft.edu.ua,,"Ivanov, Volodymyr/0000-0002-4456-994X; Stabnikova, Olena/0000-0003-4156-3021","Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan; Advanced Research Lab and the Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology, National University of Food Technologies, Kyiv, Ukraine","This analysis of environmental safety and biosafety of bioclogging and biocementation processes was partially supported by the Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, and the Advanced Research Lab and the Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology, National University of Food Technologies, Kyiv, Ukraine.",,91,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0959-3993,1573-0972,,WORLD J MICROB BIOT,World J.

Here, Magnetic Field Assisted Finishing (MFAF) process is used to finish biomaterials in the nanometer level. MFAF process uses Magnetorheological (MR) fluid mixed with abrasive particles as the polishing medium. In this study, titanium is used as the workpiece material. A specially designed tool is used to carry out the nanofinishing process. Two types of path planning i.e. parallel and spiral tool path are adopted during finishing. The surface roughness and surface texture differ for each generated tool path. The surface roughness generated from each of the path planning processes is analyzed and it is found that parallel toolpath generates lowest surface roughness (similar to 10nm) with better surface texture than spiral toolpath. Hence, the parallel toolpath is considered as the optimum toolpath for finishing biomaterials in MFAF process. Experimental investigations using parallel tool path are carried out to explore the capability of the developed novel tool along with the determination of the optimum range of the process parameters to explore finishing capability. Preliminary experimental study shows that best surface finish and surface topography is achieved using 1200rpm tool rotational speed, 1mm working gap, and 6.30h. finishing time.","[Barman, Anwesa; Das, Manas] IIT Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India","Das, M (reprint author), IIT Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India.",manasdas@iitg.ernet.in,,,"Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India [ME/P/MDA/02]","We acknowledge the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India for their financial support for project No. ME/P/MDA/02 entitled ""Nanofinishing of Freeform Surfaces using Magnetorheological Fluid based Finishing (MRFF) process"".

Moreover, the microstructure and bonding condition of SLM-fabricated composite are investigated. Additionally, morphological properties, mechanical properties, and permeability of three different porous structures are studied and compared with each other based on experiment and simulation. It is revealed that the microstructure of SLM-fabricated composite exhibits anisotropic due to the layered manufacturing essence.

Computerized tomography is employed to access three-dimensional (3D) microstructure of the closed-cell aluminum foam. Effective parameters including foam density and the velocity of impactor on foam dynamic behavior are investigated. In order to show the validity and accuracy of results, some static experiments and low-velocity impact tests have been conducted. Results indicate a remarkable agreement between the simulation and experimental data. Moreover, the results show that by increasing the density of foam samples, the highest difference between numerical and experimental results for peak stress and absorbed energy are 35.9% and 6.9%, respectively, which is related to the highest density. For impact velocities ranging from 3.1 to 4.2m/s, the maximum discrepancy in peak stress and absorbed energy occur at an impact velocity of 3.1m/s in which corresponding errors are 33.3% and 6.6%, respectively.

Excessive cyclic loading on the suture line of the repair can progressively damage the surrounding tissue and finally cause tissue rupture. Moreover, mechanical over-tension, which occurs in a diseased mitral valve, gradually leads to tissue floppiness, mitral annular dilation, and leaflet rupture. In this work, the rupture mechanics of mitral valve is studied by characterizing the fracture toughness exhaustion of healthy tissue. Results of this study show that fracture toughness of the posterior mitral valve is lower than its anterior counterpart, indicating that posterior tissue is more prone to failure. Moreover, the decrease in fracture toughness by increasing the number of fatigue cycles shows that excessive mechanical loading leads to progressive failure and rupture of mitral valve tissue within a damage accumulative process.","[Javid, Farhad] MIT, Koch Inst Canc Res, 500 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA; [Shahmansouri, Nastaran; Angeles, Jorge; Mongrain, Rosaire] McGill Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 817 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada; [Angeles, Jorge] McGill Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ctr Intelligent Machines, 3480 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada","Javid, F (reprint author), MIT, Koch Inst Canc Res, 500 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA.",farhad.javid@mail.mcgill.ca,,,"NSERC, Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; FRQNT, Quebec's Fonds de recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies","We wish to thank Mr. Boby Chu for the design and fabrication of the fatigue and the fracture toughness devices and Dr. Amir K.

We have herein, for the first time, reported the construction of luminescent lanthanide-collagen peptide hybrid three-dimensional nano fibrous scaffolds, which well mimic the characteristic architectural structure of native collagen. Three collagen mimetic peptides, composed of repetitive central (GPO)(7) sequences and altered terminal amino acids, have been shown to consistently self-assemble to form biocompatible nanofibers under the trigger of a variety of lanthanide ions, which also functionalize the assembled materials with easily tunable photoluminescence. Furthermore, the collagen peptide-lanthanide hybrid scaffolds possess programmable pH-responsive features. The lanthanide ion-mediated assembly of all three collagen peptides are conveniently and reversibly regulated by pH, while their pH-dependent patterns are finely tuned by the identity of terminal amino acids. Using camptothecin and cefoperazone sodium as two model drugs, the drug-loading and releasing efficiency of the collagen peptide-lanthanide scaffolds are nicely modulated by pH, demonstrating the efficacy of these nanofibrous scaffolds as pH-responsive drug carriers. These novel luminescent collagen peptide-lanthanide scaffolds provide a facile system for pH-controlled drug delivery, suggesting promising applications in the development of therapies for many diseases.","[Yao, Linyan; Hu, Yue; Liu, Zhao; Ding, Xiao; Tian, Jing; Xiao, Jianxi] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Nonferrous Met Chem & Resources Utilizat, State Key Lab Appl Organ Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Xiao, JX (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Nonferrous Met Chem & Resources Utilizat, State Key Lab Appl Organ Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",xiaojx@lzu.edu.cn,,"Xiao, Jianxi/0000-0002-9863-572X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [21775059]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2016-k10],This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 21775059) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant lzujbky-2016-k10).,,64,0,0,2,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1543-8384,,,MOL PHARMACEUT,Mol.

Functional evaluations of repaired conduits as well as histologic, immunohistochemical, and histomorphometric analyses of neotissues were assessed. Results Prior to scheduled euthanasia, survival rates of rats receiving BLSF or SIS grafts were >= 94%, with no clinical signs of airway obstruction observed over the course of the study. Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed that the mean percentage of stenosis was <20% in both implant groups.

Looking deep into nature has in the last few years become much more achievable through the use of high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT). The non-destructive nature of microCT, combined with three-dimensional visualization and analysis, allows for the most complete internal and external ""view"" of natural materials and structures at both macro- and micro-scale. This capability brings with it the possibility to learn from nature at an unprecedented level of detail in full three dimensions, allowing us to improve our current understanding of structures, learn from them and apply them to solve engineering problems. The use of microCT in the fields of biomimicry, biomimetic engineering and bioinspiration is growing rapidly and holds great promise. MicroCT images and three-dimensional data can be used as generic bio-inspiration, or may be interpreted as detailed blueprints for specific engineering applications, i.e., reverse-engineering nature. In this review, we show how microCT has been used in bioinspiration and biomimetic studies to date, including investigations of multifunctional structures, hierarchical structures and the growing use of additive manufacturing and mechanical testing of 3D printed models in combination with microCT. The latest microCT capabilities and developments which might support biomimetic studies are described and the unique synergy between microCT and biomimicry is demonstrated. Statement of significance This review highlights the growing use of X-ray micro computed tomography in biomimetic research. We feel the timing of this paper is excellent as there is a significant growth and interest in biomimetic research, also coupled with additive manufacturing, but still no review of the use of microCT in this field. The use of microCT for structural biomimetic and biomaterials research has huge potential but is still under-utilized, partly due to lack of knowledge of the capabilities and how it can be used in this field. We hope this review fills this gap and fuels further advances in this field using microCT. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such meta-biomaterials are usually topologically ordered and are designed by repeating a number of regular unit cells in different directions to create a lattice structure. Establishing accurate topology-property relationships is of critical importance for these materials. In this paper, we specifically focus on AM metallic meta-biomaterials aimed for application as bone substitutes and orthopaedic implants and review the currently available evidence regarding their mechanical performance under quasi-static and cyclic loading conditions. The topology-property relationships are reviewed for regular beam-based lattice structures, sheet-based lattice structures including those based on triply periodic minimal surface, and graded designs. The predictive models used for establishing the topology property relationships including analytical and computational models are covered as well. Moreover, we present an overview of the effects of the AM processes, material type, tissue regeneration, biodegradation, surface bio-functionalization, post-manufacturing (heat) treatments, and loading profiles on the quasi-static mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of AM meta-biomaterials. AM meta-biomaterials exhibiting unusual mechanical properties such as negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic meta-biomaterials), shape memory behavior, and superelasitcity as well as the potential applications of such unusual behaviors (e.g. deployable implants) are presented too. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future research. Statement of Significance Additive manufacturing enables fabrication of meta-biomaterials with rare combinations of topological, mechanical, and mass transport properties. Given that the micro-scale topological design determines the macro-scale properties of meta-biomaterials, establishing topology-property relationships is the central research question when rationally designing meta-biomaterials. The interest in understanding the relationship between the topological design and material type on the one hand and the mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of meta-biomaterials on the other hand is currently booming. This paper presents and critically evaluates the most important trends and findings in this area with a special focus on the metallic biomaterials used for skeletal applications to enable researchers better understand the current state-of-the-art and to guide the design of future research projects.

However, dECM hydrogels often display poor printability on their own and necessitate additives or support materials to enable true 3D structures. In this study, we used a sacrificial material, 3D-printed Pluronic F-127, to serve as a platform into which dECM hydrogel can be incorporated to create specifically designed structures made entirely up of dECM. The effects of 3D dECM are studied in the context of engineering the intrahepatic biliary tree, an often-understudied topic in liver tissue engineering. Encapsulating biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) within liver dECM has been shown to lead to the formation of complex biliary trees in vitro. By varying several aspects of the dECM structures' geometry, such as width and angle, we show that we can guide the directional formation of biliary trees. This is confirmed by computational 3D image analysis of duct alignment. This system also enables fabrication of a true multi-layer dECM structure and the formation of 3D biliary trees into which other cell types can be seeded. For example, we show that hepatocyte spheroids can be easily incorporated within this system, and that the seeding sequence influences the resulting structures after seven days in culture. Statement of Significance The field of liver tissue engineering has progressed significantly within the past several years, however engineering the intrahepatic biliary tree has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we utilize the inherent bioactivity of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels and 3D-printing of a sacrificial biomaterial to create spatially defined, 3D biliary trees. The creation of patterned, 3D dECM hydro gels in the past has only been possible with additives to the gel that may stifle its bioactivity, or with rigid and permanent support structures that may present issues upon implantation. Additionally, the biological effect of 3D spatially patterned liver dECM has not been demonstrated independent of the effects of dECM bioactivity alone. This study demonstrates that sacrificial materials can be used to create pure, multi-layer dECM structures, and that strut width and angle can be changed to influence the formation and alignment of biliary trees encapsulated within. Furthermore, this strategy allows co-culture of other cells such as hepatocytes. We demonstrate that not only does this system show promise for tissue engineering the intrahepatic biliary tree, but it also aids in the study of duct formation and cell-cell interactions.

However, removing DNA from cartilage (dCart) requires harsh treatments due to its dense structure, causing loss of bioactivity and limiting its application as a cartilaginous extra cellular matrix (ECM). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the successful application of vitreous humor (VH), a highly hydrated tissue closely resembling the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen composition of cartilage, as an ECM hydrogel to support chondrogenic differentiation. Equine VH was extracted followed by biochemical quantifications, histological examinations, cytotoxicity (human mesenchymal stromal cells, hMSCs and human articular chondrocytes, hACs) and U937 cell proliferation studies. VH was further seeded with hACs or hMSC5 and cultured for 3-weeks to study chondrogenesis compared to scaffold-free micro-tissue pellet cultures and collagen-I hydrogels. Viability, metabolic activity, GAG and DNA content, chondrogenic gene expression (aggrecan, collagen I/II mRNA) and mechanical properties were quantified and matrix deposition was visualised using immunohistochemistry (Safranin-O, collagen I/II). VH was successfully extracted, exhibiting negligible amounts of DNA (0.4 +/- 0.4 mu g/mg dry-weight) and notable preservation of ECM components. VH displayed neither cytotoxic responses nor proliferation of macrophage-like U937 cells, instead enhancing both hMSC and hAC proliferation. Interestingly, encapsulated cells self-assembled the VH-hydrogel into spheroids, resulting in uniform distribution of both GAGs and collagen type II with increased compressive mechanical properties, rendering VH a permissive native ECM source to fabricate cartilaginous hydrogels for potential TE applications. Statement of Significance Fabricating bioactive and cell-instructive cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) derived biomaterials and hydrogels has over recent years proven to be a challenging task, often limited by poor retention of inherent environmental cues post decellularisation due to the dense and avascular nature of native cartilage. In this study, we present an alternative route to fabricate highly permissive and bioactive ECM hydrogels from vitreous humor (VH) tissue. This paper specifically reports the discovery of optimal VH extraction protocols and cell seeding strategy enabling fabrication of cartilaginous matrix components into a hydro gel support material for promoting chondrogenic differentiation. The work showcases a naturally intact and unmodified hydrogel design that improves cellular responses and may help guide the development of cell instructive and stimuli responsive hybrid biomaterials in a number of TERM applications.

Previously, we developed a free-standing biodegradable polymer nanosheet composed of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) using a simple fabrication process consisting of spin-coating and peeling techniques. We reported that sandwich-type PLLA nanosheets loaded with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) displayed long-lasting, sustained release of rhBMP-2, and markedly enhanced bone regeneration in mouse calvarial bone defects. Here, we fabricated multi-layered nanosheets loaded with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and investigated their application for long bone regeneration. Subcutaneously implanted tri-layered PLLA nanosheets displayed sustained release of loaded rhFGF-2 for about 2 weeks. Next, we prepared critical-sized mouse femoral defects and implanted mono- or tri-layered nanosheets, or a gelatin hydrogel with rhFGF-2. Amongst these conditions, the tri-layered nanosheet most efficiently induced bone regeneration. Indeed, bone regeneration was enhanced even after 4 weeks in the tri-layered nanosheet group, and was accompanied by FGFR1 activation and subsequent osteoblast differentiation. Multi-layered PLLA nanosheets loaded with rhFGF-2 may be useful for bone regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the multi-layered PLLA nanosheet structure may potentially be applied as a potent sustained-release carrier. Statements of Significance Here, we describe multi-layered poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanosheets loaded with recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (rhFGF-2) as a modified sustained-release carrier for bone regeneration. In vivo imaging system analysis revealed that subcutaneously implanted tri-layered PLLA nanosheets displayed sustained release of loaded rhFGF-2 for 2 weeks. In critical-sized mouse femoral defects, tri-layered nanosheets loaded with rhFGF-2 most efficiently induced bone regeneration. Notably, bone regeneration was enhanced even after 4 weeks in the tri-layered nanosheet group, and was accompanied by FGFR1 activation and subsequent osteoblast differentiation.

The uniform and geometry-independent grafting of zwitterionic polymers on curved cross linked polyethylene (CLPE), which is used in artificial hip joints, surface was successfully achieved. Poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) and poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)dimethyl(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide) (PMEDSAH) were grafted on the CLPE by two methods: a UV based process and a thermal process. The thermal method yielded zwitterionic surfaces with similar hydrophilicities and graft layer thicknesses to those prepared via the UV grafting method. The X-ray photoelectron spectra and surface zeta potential results showed that the PMPC and PMEDSAH layers were successfully grafted onto the CLPE surface. In addition, 3-D confocal microscopy, as well as friction and wear volume tests, confirmed that there was a significant decrease in the friction coefficient and wear, which indicates that the thermal grafting method can successfully substitute the UV grafting method. The thermally grafted polymer showed uniform graft layer thickness on the curved CLPE surface, whereas the UV-grafted polymer showed a geometry-dependent heterogeneous graft layer thickness. Thus, we confirmed that the thermal grafting method is advantageous for the preparation of uniform grafting layers on artificial joint surfaces with complicated shapes. Statement of Significance Formation of uniform grafting thickness of the zwitterionic polymers on the implant materials is a very important issue in the field of biomaterials. In this study, a thermal grafting process was developed for the formation of the uniform grafting thickness of the zwitterionic polymers on the curved cross linked polyethylene (CLPE) surface used in artificial hip-joint. This method yielded zwitterionized CLPE surfaces with similar hydrophilicities and friction coefficient to those prepared via the UV grafting method which has been widely used process to modify the implant surfaces. Furthermore, the thermally grafted CLPE surface showed geometry-independent uniform grafting thickness on the curved CLPE surface while UV-grafted one showed uneven grafting thickness. This grafting method could help the development of complex, personalized, and biocompatible artificial liner surfaces. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Method/Results To bridge this gap, we performed a rigorous mechanical, morphological, and microstructural characterization of the MV and TV leaflets and chordae in a porcine model. Planar biaxial testing, uniaxial testing, second harmonic generation imaging and Verhoeff Van Gieson staining were performed. Morphological parameters, tissue moduli, extensibility, and anisotropy were quantified and compared. No major differences in leaflet mechanics or structure were found between TV and MV; chordal mechanics, morphology, and structure were found to compensate for anatomical and physiological loading differences between the valves. No differences in chordal mechanics were observed by insertion point within a leaflet; the septal tricuspid leaflet (STL) and posterior mitral leaflet (PML) did not have distinguishable strut chords, and the STL had the shortest chords. Within a valve, chords from septally-located leaflets were more extensible. MV chords were stiffer. Conclusions This study presents the first rigorous comparative mechanical and structural dataset of MV and TV structures. Valve type and anatomical location may be stronger predictors of chordal mechanics. Chords from septally-located leaflets differ from each other and from their intravalvular counterparts; they merit special consideration in surgical and computational applications. Statement of Significance A better understanding of the tricuspid valve (TV) and its associated structures is important for making advancements towards the repair of tricuspid regurgitation. Mitral valve structures have been extensively studied, but little is known about the TV and right-sided heart diseases. Clinical decisions and computational simulations often rely heavily on MV data for TV applications, despite fundamentally different environments. We therefore performed a rigorous mechanical, morphological, and microstructural characterization of atrioventricular leaflets and chordae tendineae in a porcine model. Finding that valve type and anatomical location may be strong predictors of chordal mechanics, chords from septally-located leaflets differ from each other and from their intravalvular counterparts; they merit special consideration in surgical and computational applications.

170,J,"Bar-On, B",,,,"Bar-On, Benny",,,On the form and bio-mechanics of venom-injection elements,ACTA BIOMATERIALIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bio-mechanics; Venom-injection element; Mechanics of biomaterials; Structure-function relationships; Analytical modeling,,"A wide variety of animals-from insects to snakes-crucially depend on their ability to inject venom into their target, be it their prey or their predator. To effectively deliver their venom, venomous animals use a specialized biomechanical element whose tip must penetrate through the integument of the target. During this process, the tip of the venom-injection element (VIE) is subject to local forces, which may deform it and cause considerable structural damage to the VIE, with devastating consequences for the survival of the animal or, in the case of eusocial insects, to the colony. Hence, it is plausible that millions of years of evolution have carefully 'shaped' the architecture of VIEs across different taxa toward a similar mechanical function, namely, to effectively resist the mechanical forces exerted on the tip. The present study aims to identify such a common architecture by analyzing the form-function relationships in various biological VIEs. A universal structural modeling, which quantifies the fundamental geometrical characteristics of a wide range of VIEs is constituted, and a theoretical mechanical framework that analytically correlates these characteristics with the material stress fields is introduced. This investigation reveals that the architecture of biological VIEs reduces the magnitude of applied stresses and confines the maximal stress to the near-tip region of the element. The presented analytical approach and modeling can be straightforwardly applied to various other types of bio-mechanical elements and can potentially be employed for developing a new class of microscopic injection elements for bio-medical and engineering applications. Statement of Significance Venomous animals-both vertebrate and invertebrate-use an extremely wide variety of venom-injection elements to incapacitate their prey or predator. Despite the clear differences in their typical dimensions, shapes, and evolutionary paths, all venom-injection elements have evolved to perform a single mechanical function, namely, to penetrate a target surface. Accordingly, the architecture of many such elements appears to follow similar principles and their material exhibits similar stress characteristics upon biologically relevant mechanical loadings. The current study introduces a theoretical model that draws connections between the 'universal' structural characteristics of such elements and their bio-mechanical functions. It is found that all examined venom-injection elements provide extreme load-bearing capabilities and unusual post-failure functionalities, which are in good agreement with the wide range of numerical and experimental findings from the literature. The emerging theoretical insights from this study thus shed light on the biomechanical origins of the naturally evolved forms of various biological organisms, including bee and wasp stingers, spider and snake fangs, porcupine fish spines, and scorpion stingers.

A common strategy to create a bioactive soft material is the integration of biomacromolecules with polymers. However, limited by their complex structures and sensitivity to temperature and chemicals, it is relatively difficult to maintain the bioactivity of biomacromolecules during their preparation, storage, and application. Here, a new kind of bioactive soft material based on the molecular integration of metal ions and polymers is designed and exemplified by a hybrid of magnesium ion (Mg2+) and poly(glycerol-sebacate-maleate) (PGSM-Mg). Mg2+ was firmly incorporated into PGSM molecules through a complexation interaction as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The PGSM matrix provided the soft nature and facile processing of the hybrid, which could serve as an injectable material and be fabricated into elastic porous three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. The Mg2+ immobilized in the PGSM chain conferred neuroactivity to the resultant hybrid. PGSM-Mg exhibited adequate biodegradability and a sustained release of Mg2+. PGSM-Mg 3D scaffolds promoted the adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells (SCs) more effectively than poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds. Furthermore, SCs on PGSM-Mg scaffolds expressed significantly more neural specific genes than those on PLGA, PGS, and PGSM, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophic factor-3 (NTF3). All these results indicated that Mg2+ immobilized through molecular integration could efficiently regulate the bioactivity of polymers. In view of the wide availability, diverse bioactivity, and high stability of metal ions, the strategy of molecular coupling of metal ions and polymers is expected to be a new general approach to construct bioactive soft materials. Statement of Significance Bioactive soft materials are designed on the basis of the molecular integration of metal ions and polymers. Immobilized metal ions offer a new way to endow bioactivity to polymers. Different from biomolecules such as proteins and genes, metal ions are quite stable and can resist harsh processing conditions. Further, the polymeric matrix provides the soft nature and facile processing of the hybrid. Different from stiff metal-containing inorganic materials, the hybrid is a biomimetic soft material and can be readily processed just like its polymer precursor under mild conditions. In view of the diversity of metal ions and polymers, this strategy is expected to be a new powerful and general approach to construct bioactive soft materials for a wide range of biomedical applications.

The incorporation of SWCNTs inside lysozyme crystals gives rise to reinforced composite materials with tunable mechanical strength and electronic conductivity, while preserving the crystal quality and morphology. These reinforced crystals show increased catalytic activity at higher temperatures, being active even above the denaturation temperature. The electron transport through the crystals is linked to the content and distribution of SWCNT bundles inside the crystals. The electron conduction through the crystals is isotropic and very efficient, presenting high conductivity values up to 600 nS at very low (0.05 wt%) SWCNT concentration. To obtain these crystals, a new protocol based on the in situ crystallization of lysozyme in composite SWCNT-peptide hydrogels is developed. These peptide hydrogels are able to homogeneously disperse bundles of hydrophobic SWCNTs allowing first, the crystallization of the enzyme lysozyme and second, transferring the new properties of the inorganic component to the crystals. Taken together, these composite crystals represent an example of the versatility of proteins as biological substrates in the generation of novel functional materials, opening the door to use them in catalysis and bioelectronics at macroscale.","[Contreras-Montoya, Rafael; Cuerva, Juan M.; Alvarez de Cienfuegos, Luis] Univ Granada UGR, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Orggn, Avda Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Escolano, Guillermo; Gavira, Jose A.] Univ Granada, CSIC, Lab Estudios Cristalog, Inst Anda Luz Ciencias Tierra, Ave Palmeras 4, Granada 18100, Spain; [Roy, Subhasish; Ashkenasy, Nurit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Mat Engn, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Lopez-Lopez, Modesto T.] UGR, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis Aplicada, Avda Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Delgado-Lopez, Jose M.] UGR, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Inorgan, Avda Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Diaz-Mochon, Juan J.] Univ Granada, Fac Farm, Dept Quim Farmaceut & Organ,PTS Granada, Ctr Genom & Oncol Res Pfizer,UGR,Andalusian Reg G, Ave Ilustrac 114, Granada 18016, Spain; [Ashkenasy, Nurit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilse Katz Inst Nanoscale Sci & Technol, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Roy, Subhasish] BITS Pilani, Dept Chem, KK Birla Goa Campus,NH 17B,Bypass Rd, Sancoale 403726, Goa, India","de Cienfuegos, LA (reprint author), Univ Granada UGR, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Orggn, Avda Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.; Gavira, JA (reprint author), Univ Granada, CSIC, Lab Estudios Cristalog, Inst Anda Luz Ciencias Tierra, Ave Palmeras 4, Granada 18100, Spain.; Ashkenasy, N (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Mat Engn, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.; Ashkenasy, N (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilse Katz Inst Nanoscale Sci & Technol, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",nurita@bgu.ac.il; jgavira@iact.ugr-csic.es; lac@ugr.es,,,"Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, MINECO [BIO2016-74875-P, FIS2017-85954-R]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, AEI, Spain [BIO2016-74875-P, FIS2017-85954-R]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, FEDER, European Union; Junta de Andalucia (Spain) [P12-FQM-2721, P12-FQM-790]; ""Unidad de Excelencia Quimica aplicada a Biomedicina y Medioambiente"" (UGR)","This study was supported by the projects BIO2016-74875-P and FIS2017-85954-R (Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, MINECO, and Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, AEI, Spain, co-funded by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, FEDER, European Union) and by the Junta de Andalucia (Spain) projects P12-FQM-2721 and P12-FQM-790.

Both naturally-derived and synthetic materials have successfully been used for these applications in the clinic. However, the increasing complexity of these applications requires materials with advanced properties, especially customizable or tunable materials with bioactivity. To address this issue, there have been recent efforts to better recapitulate the properties of natural materials using synthetic biomaterials composed of sequence-controlled polymers. Sequence control mimics the primary structure found in biopolymers, and in many cases, provides an extra handle for functionality in synthetic polymers. Here, we first review the advances in synthetic methods that have enabled sequence-controlled biomaterials on a relevant scale, and discuss strategies for choosing functional sequences from a biomaterials engineering context. Then, we highlight several recent studies that show strong impact of sequence control on biomaterial properties, including in vitro and in vivo behavior, in the areas of hydrogels, therapeutic materials, and novel applications such as molecular barcodes for medical devices. The role of sequence control in biomaterials properties is an emerging research area, and there remain many opportunities for investigation. Further study of this topic may significantly advance our understanding of bioactive or smart materials, as well as contribute design rules to guide the development of synthetic biomaterials for future applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","[Austin, Mariah J.; Rosales, Adrianne M.] Univ Texas Austin, McKetta Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Rosales, AM (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, McKetta Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",arosales@che.utexas.edu,,"Austin, Mariah/0000-0002-6968-5170",Burroughs Wellcome Fund [1015895]; University of Texas Engineering Doctoral Fellowship Endowment,AMR gratefully acknowledges a Career Award at the Scientific Interface (#1015895) from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.

However, the vast majority of these materials have been designed to be mechanically robust and bioinert, whereas the potential regenerative properties of a biomaterial have not been considered. In endodontics for example, materials are used to seal the pulp cavity to avoid bacterial colonisation of the tooth and prevent further infection. While these treatments are effective in the short term, many of these materials have not been designed to interface with the pulp tissue in a biocompatible manner and are often cytotoxic. This can lead to less favourable long-term outcomes such as devitalisation of the tooth via root-canal therapy or extraction of the tooth. Clinical outcomes could be improved if regenerative approaches were followed whereby the biology of the tooth is engineered for repair and regeneration often with the support of a biomaterial. Within these, acellular or cell homing approaches are particularly interesting, as some regulatory hurdles associated with cellular therapies could be circumvented which may aid their clinical translation. In this review, we highlight progress in regenerative dentistry and focus on exciting developments using acellular biomaterials for regenerating dental tissues.","[Medina-Fernandez, Ignacio; Celiz, Adam D.] Imperial Coll, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England","Celiz, AD (reprint author), Imperial Coll, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",a.celiz@imperial.ac.uk,,"Celiz, Adam/0000-0003-4568-7734; Medina-Fernandez, Ignacio/0000-0003-3989-2838","Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College","The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College for funding.",,78,0,0,2,2,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2047-4830,2047-4849,,BIOMATER SCI-UK,Biomater.

Biodegradable polymers were synthesized using 4-hydroxyphenethyl 2-(4hydroxyphenyl) acetate (HTy), which is derived from Tyrosol and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid. p-Phenylenediacetic acid (PDA) was introduced to enhance crystallinity. To enable functionalizability without deteriorating printability, glutamic acid derivatives were introduced into the polymer design, forming copolymers including poly(HTy-co-45% PDA-co-5% Gluhexenamide ester) (HP5GH), poly(HTyco- 45% PDA-co-5% Glupentynamide ester) (HP5GP), and poly(HTy-co-45% PDA-co-5% BocGlu ester) (HP5BG). The resulting polymers have: two melting temperatures (125-131 degrees C and 141-147 degrees C), Young's moduli of 1.9-2.4 GPa, and print temperatures of 170-190 degrees C. The molecular weight (M-w) loss due to hydrolytic degradation was gradual with similar to 30% M-w retained after 25 weeks for HP5BG, whereas it was much faster for HP5GP and HP5GH with only 18% M-w retained after 8 weeks. HP5GH and HP5GP were successfully functionalized in solution (bulk) or on the surface using click-based chemistry. Finally, the utilization of this novel platform was demonstrated by studying osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using 3D printed scaffolds from HP5GP. Scaffolds were functionalized with azide-Heparin (az-Heparin) to bind and deliver bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). This sample group significantly enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs as compared to unfunctionalized scaffolds incubated directly with az-Heparin or BMP-2 prior to cell culture. This novel polymer platform with tunable functionalizability could be utilized for additive manufacturing of biodegradable devices and scaffolds with tailored mechanical and bioactive properties for a wide range of medical applications including bone fixation devices and scaffolds for bone regeneration.","[Ji, Shen; Liaw, Chya-Yan; Guvendiren, Murat] New Jersey Inst Technol, Otto H York Chem & Mat Engn, 161 Warren St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Dube, Koustubh; Chesterman, Julian P.; Fung, Stephanie L.; Kohn, Joachim] Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Ctr Biomat, 145 Bevier Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Guvendiren, M (reprint author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Otto H York Chem & Mat Engn, 161 Warren St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.; Kohn, J (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Ctr Biomat, 145 Bevier Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",kohn@dls.rutgers.edu; muratg@njit.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DMR-1714882]; National Institute of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [P41EB001046]","This study is funded by the National Science Foundation under award number DMR-1714882 and by the National Institute of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Award Number P41EB001046.

In the present article, an original 3D printing method is developed for the production of three-dimensional structures based on hydroxyapatite and polyurethane diol, which can be further used for the fabrication of orbital implants with interconnected porosity. For this purpose, hybrid nanostructured powders were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and further used as raw materials for 3D printing of porous structures.

A reliable and robust design approach for developing lightweight multifunctional lattice structural composites was proposed, inspired by biomimetics and based on topology optimization. Three-dimensional periodic lattice blocks were initially designed, inspired by the cuttlefish bone microstructure. The topologies of the three-dimensional periodic blocks were further optimized by computer modeling, and the mechanical properties of the topology optimized lightweight lattice structures were characterized by computer modeling.

Thus, biomass and biochar from Quercus robur fruits were valorized via magnetization (for easy post-adsorption separation) to prepare optimized biomass-magnetic hybrid (BMM 0.5:1) and biochar-magnetic hybrid (BCM 1:1). The BMM 0.5:1 and BCM 1:1 were employed for Pb(II) and Cd(II) removal from simulated contaminated water. The hybrids exhibited higher values of cation exchange capacity (CEC), BET surface area and pore sizes, as well as better thermal stability and the presence of pure spinal structures of Fe3O4, along with the characteristic functional groups of biomaterials (such as the hydroxyls, amides and carboxyls). The adsorption equilibria for both cations were attained within 180 min. Adsorption mechanism involved electrostatic interactions on both external and pore surfaces, with Pb(II) data fitting the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model while Cd(II) data fitted the Freundlich. The adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic as solution temperature was increased from 292 to 310 and 328 K. The adsorption of Cd(II) initially increased with temperature but decreased on further temperature rise by similar percentages for both adsorbents. In contrast, adsorption of Pb(II) decreased continuously but the decrease was higher for BMM 0.5:1 than BCM 1:1 implying BCM is a more promising adsorbent. Adsorption capacities for BMM 0.5:1 are 63.6 and 21.0 mg/g, while BCM 1:1 has 58.2 mg/g and 21.3 mg/g for Pb(II) and Cd(II), respectively. These adsorption capacities were better than many low-cost adsorbents in literature. Thus magnetic valorization, apart from easing separation, enhances the adsorption capacity of low-cost adsorbents.

The hybrid hydrogels can adopt the intricate structure of the retina with suitable mechanical strength, degradation rate and biological activity to support cellular adhesion, survival and delivery. Meanwhile, Gel-HA hydrogel can remarkably promote RPC proliferation with much larger cell clusters, while Gel-HA-PDA hydrogel significantly enhances RPC adhesion and migration, and directs RPCs to preferentially differentiate toward retinal neurons such as photoreceptors (the most crucial cell-type for RD treatment), which is mainly induced by the activation of integrin alpha 51 beta-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. This study demonstrates that Gel-HA hydrogel possesses great potential for RPC proliferation, while mussel-inspired PDA-modified Gel-HA hydrogel with superior bio-compatibility can significantly promote RPC neuronal differentiation, providing new insights for developing biomedical materials applied for RPC-based transplantation therapy.","[Tang, Zhimin; Zhang, Yi; Yang, Yuan; Huang, Xiaolin; Wang, Yuyao; Zhang, Dandan; Ni, Ni; Luo, Min; Fan, Xianqun; Gu, Ping] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Peoples Hosp 9, Dept Ophthalmol, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zhimin; Zhang, Yi; Yang, Yuan; Huang, Xiaolin; Wang, Yuyao; Zhang, Dandan; Ni, Ni; Luo, Min; Fan, Xianqun; Gu, Ping] Shanghai Key Lab Orbital Dis & Ocular Oncol, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Fang; Zhang, Yuanhao; Liu, Feng; Zhang, Weian] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Key Lab Funct Mat Chem, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China","Fan, XQ; Gu, P (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Peoples Hosp 9, Dept Ophthalmol, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R China.; Zhang, WA (reprint author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Key Lab Funct Mat Chem, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",drfanxianqun@126.com; wazhang@ecust.edu.cn; guping2009@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundations of China [81570883, 81870687, 21574039]; National Key R&D program of China [2018YFC1106101]; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission-Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant Support [20161316]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai [17DZ2260100]","The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (81570883, 81870687 and 21574039), the National Key R&D program of China (2018YFC1106101), Shanghai Municipal Education Commission-Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant Support (20161316) and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai (17DZ2260100).",,58,0,0,23,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,2019,194,,,,,,57.0,72,,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.12.015,,,,16,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,HJ9FT,WOS:000457504900006,30583149.0,,,,2019-02-25

We present a refined method for differentiating hiPSCs into a CD31 (+) endothelial cell population (hiPSC-ECs) using a single basal medium from pluripotency to the final stage of differentiation. This protocol produces endothelial cells that are functionally competent in assays following purification. Subsequently, an in vitro angiogenesis model was developed by encapsulating the hiPSC-ECs into a tunable, growth factor sequestering hyaluronic acid (HyA) matrix where they formed stable, capillary-like networks that responded to environmental stimuli. Perfusion of the networks was demonstrated using fluorescent beads in a microfluidic device designed to study angiogenesis. The combination of hiPSC-ECs, bioinspired hydrogel, and the microfluidic platform creates a unique testbed for rapidly assessing the performance of angiogenic biomaterials.","[Natividad-Diaz, Sylvia L.; Browne, Shane; Jha, Amit K.; Ma, Zhen; Hossainy, Samir; Healy, Kevin E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jha, Amit K.; Hossainy, Samir; Healy, Kevin E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kurokawa, Yosuke K.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO USA; [George, Steven C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biomed Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ma, Zhen] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse Biomat Inst, Dept Biomed & Chem Engn, Syracuse, NY USA","Healy, KE (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kehealy@berkeley.edu,,,"NIH [T32 GM 098218, UH2TR000487, UH3TR000487]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1106400]; Jan Fandrianto and Selfia Halim Endowed Chair; Siebel Scholars Foundation","This research was supported in part by NIH grants UH2TR000487 (K.

Scaffolds 3D-printed from stiff titanium and compliant polyamide were implanted into a cylindrical metaphyseal defect 15 x 15 mm. After six weeks, bone ingrowth varied between 7 and 21% of the scaffold pore volume and this was generally inversely proportional to scaffold stiffness. The individual reparative response considerably varied among the animals, which could be divided into weak and strong responders. Notably, bone regeneration specifically within the interior of the scaffold was inversely proportional to scaffold stiffness and was strain-driven in strongly-responding animals. Conversely, bone regeneration at the periphery of the defect was injury-driven and equal in all scaffolds and in all strongly- and weakly-responding animals. The observation of the strain-driven response in some, but not all, animals highlights that scaffold compliance is desirable for triggering host bone regeneration, but scaffold permanence is important for the load-bearing, structural role of the bone-replacing device. Indeed, scaffolds may benefit from being nonresorbable and mechanically reliable for those unforeseeable cases of weakly responding recipients.","[Reznikov, Natalie; Stevens, Molly M.] Imperial Coll London, Fac Engn, Dept Mat, Dept Bioengn, London, England; [Reznikov, Natalie; Stevens, Molly M.] Imperial Coll London, Fac Engn, Inst Biomed Engn, London, England; [Boughton, Oliver R.; Cobb, Justin P.] Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England; [Ghouse, Shaaz; Jeffers, Jonathan R.

For the osseointegration process and the outcome of endosseous implantation, it is crucial to reduce the stress shielding effect and achieve sufficient biocompatibility. Powder metallurgy (PM) was utilized in this study to fabricate a new type of titanium (Ti) + magnesium (Mg) bioactive composite to enable stress-shielding reduction and obtain better biocompatibility compared with that of the traditional Ti and Ti alloys used for dental implants. Such composites are produced by well-known cost-effective and widely used PM methods, which eliminate the need for complex and costly Ti casting used in traditional implant production. The relation between the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-extruded Ti + (0-24) vol% Mg composites was investigated with respect to the Mg content. The microstructure of the composites consisted of a biodegradable Mg component in the form of filaments, elongated along the direction of extrusion, which were embedded within a permanent, bioinert Ti matrix. As the Mg content was increased, the discrete filaments became interconnected with each other and formed a continuous Mg network. Young's modulus (E) of the composites was reduced to 81 GPa, while other tensile mechanical properties were maintained at the values required for a dental implant material. The corrosion behavior of the Ti + Mg composites was studied during immersion in a Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) for up to 21 days. The elution of Mg pores formed at former Mg sites led to a further decrease of E to 74 GPa. The studied compositions showed that a new Ti + Mg metallic composite should be promising for load-bearing applications in endosseous dental implants in the future.","[Balog, Martin; Ibrahim, Ahmed Mohamed Hassan; Krizik, Peter; Bajana, Oto; Klimova, Alena] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Mat & Machine Mech, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84513, Slovakia; [Ibrahim, Ahmed Mohamed Hassan] Slovak Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Technol, Jana Bottu 2781-25, Trnava 91724, Slovakia; [Catic, Amir] Univ Zagreb, Sch Dent Med, Gunduliceva 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Schauperl, Zdravko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Mech Engn & Naval Architecture, Ivana Lucica 5, Zagreb, Croatia","Balog, M (reprint author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Mat & Machine Mech, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84513, Slovakia.",martin.balog@savba.sk,"Balog, Martin/Y-3104-2018","Balog, Martin/0000-0002-6427-1163",SRDA [APVV-16-0527],Financial support from the SRDA APVV-16-0527 (Slovakia) project is gratefully acknowledged.

Collagen fibres are the dominant load bearing component of bovine pericardium, however fibre architecture within leaflet geometries is not explicitly controlled in the manufacture of commercial devices. Thus, the purpose of this study was to ascertain the influence of pre-determined collagen fibre orientation and dispersion on the mechanical performance of bovine pericardium. Three tissue groups were tested in uniaxial tension: cross-fibre tissue (XD); highly dispersed fibre-orientations (HD); or preferred-fibre tissue (PD). Both the XD and PD tissue were tested under cyclic loading at 1.5 Hz and a stress range of 2.7 MPa. The results of the static tensile experiments illustrated that collagen fibre orientation and degree of alignment significantly influenced the material's response, whereby, there was a statistically significant decrease in material properties between the XD groups and both the PD and HD groups for ultimate tensile strength and stiffness (p < 0.01). Furthermore, HD tissue had a stiffness of approximately 58% of the PD group, and XD tissue had a stiffness of approximately 18% of the PD group. The dynamic behaviour of the XD and PD groups was extremely distinct; for example a Weibull analysis indicated that the 50% probability of failure in specimens with fibres orientated perpendicular (XD) to the loading direction occurred at 375 cycles. Due to this failure, XD specimens survived on average less than 20% of the cycles completed by those in which fibres were aligned along the loading direction (PD). The results from this study indicate that fibre architecture is a significant factor in determining static strength and fatigue life in bovine pericardium, and thus must be incorporated in the design process to improve future device durability.","[Whelan, A.; Duffy, J.; Gaul, R.

Therefore, cellular structures are more favourable for the use of implants than solid materials for their custom-designed mechanical properties. The superimposed load from various directions in vivo makes uniaxial compression testing insufficient for describing the mechanical responses. In this paper, the rotational symmetry of Gyroid cellular structure (GCS) was discussed. An approach using structural simplification and analytical solution was presented to investigate the relationship between Young's modulus and volume fraction, as well as the orientation dependence of the mechanical responses for GCS loaded in various orientations. It is concluded that the analytical solution is reasonable for a low volume fraction, through the comparison between analytical results, finite element (FE) and experimental data. Gained polar diagrams illustrate the anisotropic property of GCS and also confirm the superiority for their stable mechanical responses of diverse loading directions.","[Yang, Lei; Yan, Chunze; Li, Zhaoqing; Cai, Chao; Chen, Peng; Shi, Yusheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Mat Proc & Die & Mould Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lei; Fan, Haiyang; Yang, Shoufeng] Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn, Flanders Make, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Yang, Shoufeng] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Mat Res Grp, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Yan, CZ (reprint author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Mat Proc & Die & Mould Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Yang, SF (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn, Flanders Make, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",c_yan@hust.edu.cn; shoufeng.yang@kuleuven.be,"Yang, Shoufeng/A-3693-2009","Yang, Shoufeng/0000-0002-3888-3211",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51671091]; independent R&D subjects of Huazhong University of Science and Technology [2017JYCXJJ005]; China Scholarships Council [201706160036],"The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51671091), the independent R&D subjects of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2017JYCXJJ005), and China Scholarships Council (No. 201706160036).",,71,1,1,5,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1751-6161,1878-0180,,J MECH BEHAV BIOMED,J.

Such correlations are critical to enable scaffold design with attractive structural and mechanical cues in vivo. This study focuses on freeze-cast collagen scaffolds with three different applied cooling rates (10, 1, and 0.1 degrees C/min) and two freezing directions (longitudinal and radial). A semi-automated approach for the structural characterization of fully hydrated scaffolds by confocal microscopy is developed to facilitate an objective quantification and comparison of structural features. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy and compression testing are performed longitudinally and transversely. Structural and mechanical properties are determined on dry and fully hydrated scaffolds. Longitudinally frozen scaffolds have aligned and regular pores while those in radially frozen ones exhibit greater variations in pore geometry and alignment. Lamellar spacing, pore area, and cell wall thickness increase with decreasing cooling rate: in longitudinally frozen scaffolds from 25 mu m to 83.5 mu m, from 814 mu m(2) to 8452 mu m(2), and from 4.21 mu m to 10.4 mu m, and in radially frozen ones, from 69 mu m to 116 mu m, from 7679 mu m(2) to 25,670 mu m(2), and from 6.18 mu m to 13.6 mu m, respectively. Both longitudinally and radially frozen scaffolds possess higher mechanical property values, when loaded parallel rather than perpendicular to the ice-crystal growth direction. Modulus and yield strength range from 779 kPa to 4700 kPa and from 38 kPa to 137 kPa, respectively, as a function of cooling rate and freezing direction. Collated, the correlations obtained in this study enable the custom-design of freeze-cast collagen scaffolds, which are ideally suited for a large variety of tissue regeneration applications.","[Divakar, Prajan; Yin, Kaiyang; Wegst, Ulrike G.

Documented implant failures and increasing volume and variety of CFR PEEK implants warrant a clearer understanding of material behavior under monotonic and cyclic loading. To address this issue, we conducted monotonic and fatigue crack propagation (FCP) experiments on orthopedic grade unfilled PEEK and two formulations of CFR PEEK (PAN- and pitch-based carbon fibers). The effect of annealing on FCP behavior was also studied. Under monotonic loading, fiber type had a statistically significant effect on elastic modulus (12.5 +/- 1.3 versus 18.5 +/- 2.3 GPa, pitch versus PAN CFR PEEK, AVG +/- SD) and on ultimate tensile strength (145 +/- 9 versus 192 +/- 17 MPa, pitch versus PAN CFR PEEK, AVG +/- SD). Fiber type did not have a significant effect on failure strain. Under cyclic loading, PAN CFR PEEK demonstrated an increased resistance to FCP compared with unfilled and pitch CFR PEEK, and this improvement was enhanced following annealing. Pitch CFR PEEK exhibited FCP behavior similar to unfilled PEEK, and neither material was appreciably affected by annealing. The improvements in monotonic and FCP behavior of PAN CFR PEEK is attributed to a compound effect of inherent fiber properties, increased fiber number for an equivalent wt% reinforcement, and fiber aspect ratio. FCP was shown to proceed via cyclic modes during stable crack growth, which transitioned to static modes (more akin to monotonic fracture) at longer crack lengths. The mechanisms of fatigue crack propagation appear similar between carbon-fiber types.","[Bonnheim, Noah; Pruitt, Lisa] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, 2121 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ansari, Farzana] Exponent Inc, 149 Commonwealth Dr, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Regis, Marco; Bracco, Pierangiola] Univ Torino, Dept Chem, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy","Bonnheim, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, 2121 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",noah.bonnheim@berkeley.edu,,"Bracco, Pierangiola/0000-0003-0477-2086",,,,51,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1751-6161,1878-0180,,J MECH BEHAV BIOMED,J.

In addition to these properties, titanium dioxide is also well recognized for its biocompatibility. However, considering the necessary integration with surrounding tissues when this oxide is applied as implant coatings, there are many aspects of the adhesion mechanisms located at the interface between the biological environment and the oxide surface that still need to be addressed. Specifically regarding the surface chemistry, these oxides are mainly terminated by hydroxyl groups (-OH) that are readily functionalized by different molecules, such as the 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). In this contribution, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to examine the adsorption of MPA on anatase-and rutile-phase forms of TiO2 thin film surfaces grown by RF magnetron sputtering. According to the obtained results, both anatase and rutile TiO2 films present similarities in roughness and thickness. However, different responses to interaction with the MPA molecules were observed, wherein the functionalization was seen to occur only for the rutile phase.","[Gomes, Orisson P.; Azevedo Neto, Nilton F.; Bronze-Uhle, Erika S.; Trino, Luciana D.; dos Santos, Cassio M.; da Silva, Jose H.

The synthesized nanoparticles were charecterized and confirmed by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, UV-Visible Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, High resolution scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy techniques. The SW-Ag/ZnO was appeared in large clusters with different shaped particles, the size of them was obtained in 14-40 non. Seaweed capped Ag/ZnO particles showed the greater UV protection values achieved the 45.2% than RSW and SW-Ag. Thermal degradation characteristics of SW-Ag/ZnO have greater thermal stability than RSW and SW-Ag nanoparticles. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation performances of nanoparticles were tested under the sunlight irradiation using phenol pollutants. Their photocatalytic degradation reaction was well fitted with the first order reaction kinetics.

The main aim of this study was to assess the cytotoxicity behavior of sPEEK processed for two different sulphonation times. PEEK was functionalized by sulphuric acid treatment for 1 or 1.5 h and then dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The specimens were characterized by chemical, microstructural, thermophysical, hydrophobic, and roughness analysis. Cytotoxicity assays with fibroblasts followed ISO 10993-5. Thermophysical analyses by TGA and NMR revealed no statistical difference (p > 0,05) in the degree of sulphonation for both processing time points although chemical modifications were detected in the main polymer chain. PEEK surfaces were more hydrophilic than sPEEK surfaces and therefore biological assays revealed a higher cell proliferation on PEEK surfaces when compared to that recorded on sPEEK surfaces. Fibroblasts revealed a higher metabolic activity on PEEK than that on sPEEK specimens for 1 and 3 days of incubation. However, there was a significant increase in cell metabolic activity on sPEEK/DMSO of about 20% compared to that recorded on PEEK for 7 days of incubation. SPEEK specimens showed a limited cytocompatibility probably due to the release of sulfonic compounds to the surrounding medium. The sulphonation method should be adjusted considering different processing time and surface treatment to achieve a high biocompatibility performance of sPEEK for biomedical applications.","[Brum, Renata S.; Benfatti, Cesar A.

Production of polymers in plants is an example of application of biotechnology for improving the properties of plants, e.g. industrial properties, but it can also provide knowledge about plant physiology and metabolism. The subject of the present study was an industrially important plant: flax, Linum usitatissimum L., of a fibre cultivar (cv Nike). In the study the gene encoding PHA synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fused to a peroxisomal targeting signal, was expressed in flax plants with the aim of modifying the mechanical properties of plants. Medium-chain-length (mcl) hydroxy acids in flax plants from tissue cultures were detected by GC-FID and FTIR method. The introduced changes did not affect fatty acid content and composition in generated flax plants. Since mcl-PHA are known as elastomers, the mechanical properties of created plants were examined. Modified plants showed increases in the values of all measured parameters (except strain at break evaluated for one modified line). The largest increase was noted for tensile stiffness, which was 2- to 3-fold higher than in wild-type plants. The values estimated for another parameter, Young's modulus, was almost at the same level in generated flax plants, and they were about 2.7-fold higher when compared to unmodified plants. The created plants also exhibited up to about 2.4-fold higher tensile strength. The observed changes were accompanied by alterations in the expression of selected genes, related to cell wall metabolism in line with the highest expression of phaC1 gene. Biochemical data were confirmed by spectroscopic methods, which also revealed that crystallinity index values of cellulose in modified flax plants were increased in comparison to wild-type flax plants and correlated with biomechanical properties of plants.","[Wrobel-Kwiatkowska, Magdalena; Kropiwnicki, Mateusz; Rymowicz, Waldemar] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Food Microbiol, Chelmonskiego St 37, PL-51630 Wroclaw, Poland; [Zebrowski, Jacek] Univ Rzeszow, Fac Biotechnol, Dept Plant Physiol, Rzeszow, Poland; [Beopoulos, Athanasios] Univ Paris Saclay, Micalis Inst, INRA, AgroParisTech, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Dyminska, Lucyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Chem & Food Technol, Fac Engn & Econ, Dept Bioorgan Chem, Komandorska Str 118-120, Wroclaw, Poland; [Hanuza, Jerzy] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Low Temp & Struct Res, Okolna Str 2, Wroclaw, Poland","Wrobel-Kwiatkowska, M (reprint author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Food Microbiol, Chelmonskiego St 37, PL-51630 Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.wrobel-kwiatkowska@upwr.edu.pl,,,"Wroclaw Centre of Biotechnology, programme The Leading National Research Centre (KNOW)","The authors wish to thank Professor Jean Marc Nicaud for the possibility of PHA measurements, Professor Yves Poirier for the construct used in this study, and Professor Jan Szopa for the Agrobacterium strain.

Although these surgeries demonstrate favorable functional and anatomic outcomes, their use has been limited by complications, the 2 most common being exposure and pain. Growing evidence suggests that T lymphocytes play a critical role in the regulation of the host response to biomaterials. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to define and characterize the T-cell response and to correlate the response to collagen deposition in fibrotic capsules in mesh tissue complexes that are removed for the complications of pain vs exposure. STUDY DESIGN: Patients who were scheduled to undergo a surgical excision of mesh for pain or exposure at Magee-Women's Hospital were offered enrollment. Forty-two mesh-vagina tissue complexes were removed for the primary complaint of exposure (n = 24) vs pain (n = 18). Twenty-one patients agreed to have an additional vaginal biopsy away from the site of mesh that served as control tissue. T cells were examined via immunofluorescent labeling for cell surface markers CD4+ (T-h), CD8+ (cytotoxic) and foxp3 (T-regulatory cell). Frozen sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for gross morphologic condition and picrosirius red for collagen fiber analysis. Interrupted sodium-dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis was used to quantify the content of collagens type I and III, and the collagen III/I ratio. Transforming growth factor-beta and connective tissue growth factor, which are implicated in the development of fibrosis, were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Data were analyzed with the Student's t tests, mixed effects linear regression, and Spearman's correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Demographic data were not different between groups, except for body mass index, which was 31.7 kg/m(2) for the exposure group and 28.2 kg/m(2) for pain (P = .04). Tissue complexes demonstrated a marked, but highly localized, foreign body response. We consistently observed a teardrop-shaped fibroma that encapsulated mesh fibers in both pain and exposure groups, with the T cells localized within the tip of this configuration away from the mesh-tissue interface. All 3 T-cell populations were significantly increased relative to control: CD4(+) T helper (P<.001), foxp3(+) T regulatory (P<.001), and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell (P=.034) in the exposure group. In the pain group, only T-helper (P<.001) and T-regulatory cells (P<.001) were increased, with cytotoxic T cells (P=.520) not different from control. Picrosirius red staining showed a greater area of green (thin) fibers in the exposure group (P=.025) and red (thick) fibers in the pain group (P<.001). The ratio of area green/(yellow + orange + red) that represented thin vs thick fibers was significantly greater in the exposure group (P=.005). Analysis of collagen showed that collagen type I was increased by 35% in samples with mesh complications (exposure and pain) when compared with control samples (P=.043). Strong correlations between the profibrosis cytokine transforming growth factor-beta and collagen type I and III were found in patients with pain (r >= 0.833; P=.01) but not exposure (P>.7). CONCLUSION: T cells appear to play a critical role in the long-term host response to mesh and may be a central pathway that leads to complications. The complexity of this response warrants further investigation and has the potential to broaden our understanding of mesh biology and clinical outcomes.","[Tennyson, Lauren] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Meyn, Leslie; Liang, Rui; Moalli, Pamela] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Obstet, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA; [Meyn, Leslie; Liang, Rui; Moalli, Pamela] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Gynecol, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA; [Meyn, Leslie; Liang, Rui; Moalli, Pamela] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA; [Rytel, Matthew; Palcsey, Stacy; Liang, Rui; Moalli, Pamela] Magee Womens Res Inst, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Moalli, P (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Obstet, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA.; Moalli, P (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Gynecol, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA.; Moalli, P (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA.",pmoalli@mail.magee.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [R01 HD061811],Supported by National Institutes of Health awards R01 HD061811 (P.M.).,,26,1,1,3,3,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0002-9378,1097-6868,,AM J OBSTET GYNECOL,Am.

With the development and refinement of manufacturing technology, much research has recently been focused on substrate topography-induced cell differentiation, particularly in the field of tissue engineering. Even without biological and chemical stimuli, the differentiation of stem cells can also be initiated by various biomaterials with different topographic features. However, the underlying mechanisms of this biological phenomenon remain elusive. During the past few decades, many researchers have demonstrated that cells can sense the topography of materials through the assembly and polymerization of membrane proteins. Following the activation of RHO, TGF-b or FAK signaling pathways, cells can be induced into various differentiation states. But these signaling pathways often coincide with canonical mechanical transduction pathways, and no firm conclusion has been reached among researchers in this field on topography-specific signaling pathways. On the other hand, some substrate topographies are reported to have the ability to inhibit differentiation and maintain the stemness' of stem cells. In this review, we will summarize the role of topography in musculoskeletal system regeneration and explore possible topography-related signaling pathways involved in cell differentiation.","[Huang, Jiayun; Chen, Yangwu; Tang, Chenqi; Fei, Yang; Ruan, Dengfeng; Chen, Weishan; Shen, Weiliang] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Orthoped Surg, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayun; Chen, Yangwu; Tang, Chenqi; Wu, Haoyu; Paul, Maswikiti Ewetse; Chen, Xiao; Yin, Zi; Shen, Weiliang] Zhejiang Univ, Dr Li Dak Sum & Yip Yio Chin Ctr Stem Cell & Rege, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayun; Chen, Yangwu; Tang, Chenqi; Fei, Yang; Ruan, Dengfeng; Shen, Weiliang] Zhejiang Univ, Orthopaed Res Inst, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayun; Chen, Yangwu; Tang, Chenqi; Wu, Haoyu; Paul, Maswikiti Ewetse; Chen, Xiao; Yin, Zi; Shen, Weiliang] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Dept Sports Med, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Heng, Boon Chin] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Dent, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayun; Chen, Yangwu; Tang, Chenqi; Fei, Yang; Ruan, Dengfeng; Chen, Xiao; Shen, Weiliang] China Orthopaed Regenerat Med CORMed, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Shen, WL (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Orthoped Surg, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Shen, WL (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Dr Li Dak Sum & Yip Yio Chin Ctr Stem Cell & Rege, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Shen, WL (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Orthopaed Res Inst, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Shen, WL (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Dept Sports Med, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Shen, WL (reprint author), China Orthopaed Regenerat Med CORMed, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wlshen@zju.edu.cn,"Chen, Xiao/A-4384-2009","Chen, Xiao/0000-0002-4438-5286","National key R&D program of China [2017YFA0104901, 2017YFA0104900]; National key research and development program of China [2016YFC1100204]; NSFC [81572115, 81874019, 81572157, 81330041, 81125014, 31271041, 81201396, 81271970, J1103603, 81522029, 31570987, 81401781]; Regenerative Medicine in Innovative Medical Subjects of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Provincial Program for the Cultivation of High-Level Innovative Health Talents, Zhejiang Province [Z2100086, LY12H06006, LR14H060001, LY14H060003]; Key scientific and technological innovation team of Zhejiang Province [2013TD11]; Medical and Health Science and Technology Plan of the Department of Health of Zhejiang Province [2013RCA010, 2014KYB052]; Medical Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Province [201341741]; Zhejiang Provisional Grant [2012C33015]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China [2015DFG32130]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work of our research group was supported by the National key R&D program of China (2017YFA0104901, 2017YFA0104900), National key research and development program of China (2016YFC1100204), NSFC Grants (81572115, 81874019, 81572157, 81330041, 81125014, 31271041, 81201396, 81271970, J1103603, 81522029, 31570987, 81401781), Regenerative Medicine in Innovative Medical Subjects of Zhejiang Province and Zhejiang Provincial Program for the Cultivation of High-Level Innovative Health Talents, Zhejiang Province Grants (Z2100086, LY12H06006, LR14H060001, LY14H060003), the Key scientific and technological innovation team of Zhejiang Province (2013TD11), Medical and Health Science and Technology Plan of the Department of Health of Zhejiang Province (2013RCA010, 2014KYB052), Medical Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Province (201341741), and Zhejiang Provisional Grant (2012C33015).

Carious dentin surrounding the exposure site was used as the inclusion criteria for all teeth, which were randomly divided into two groups according to pulpotomy material [MTA group (n=24), Biodentine group (n=20)]. Treatment was followed up clinically and radiologically for 24months. Pulp canal obliteration was not regarded as a failure.ResultsClinical and radiographic success rates at the end of 24months were 100% for the MTA group and 89.4% for the Biodentine group. Success rates did not vary significantly between the groups (p=0.646). Pulp canal obliteration was observed in two teeth (8.3%) in the MTA group at 6months, but the teeth were found to be stabilized by 24months.ConclusionThe long-term clinical and radiographic success rates obtained in this study indicate that both MTA and Biodentine are appropriate options for pulpotomy treatment of primary teeth with carious exposure in patients whose teeth should be retained for long periods of time.Clinical relevanceThe etiology of exposure determines pulpal response, making it crucial to distinguish between mechanical and carious exposures. The carious exposure is presumed to be accompanied by severe inflammation, which makes the prognosis of treatment unpredictable. Biomaterials can be used especially in cases with carious pulp exposures.","[Celik, Burcu Nihan; Sari, Saziye] Ankara Univ, Dept Pedodont, Fac Dent, Ankara, Turkey; [Mutluay, Merve Safa] Kirikkale Univ, Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Kirikkale, Turkey; [Arikan, Volkan] Kirikkale Univ, Dept Pedodont, Fac Dent, Kirikkale, Turkey","Celik, BN (reprint author), Ankara Univ, Dept Pedodont, Fac Dent, Ankara, Turkey.",bncelik@ankara.edu.tr,,,,,,43,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1432-6981,1436-3771,,CLIN ORAL INVEST,Clin.

The unique advantages of this technology, including low cost, programmability, high resolution, high throughput, high speed, and biocompatibility, may reduce the financial resources needed to discover new drug candidates. Sophisticated and miniaturized assays have been developed to accomplish drug discovery and drug screening using modern inkjet dispensing printers. Areas covered: This paper reviews recent advancements in the field of inkjet printer technology for drug discovery. Various types of inkjet printers and their recent use for the drug discovery are summarized; physical and biological limitations of this technology are also examined. Furthermore, typical inks used in the inkjet printing technology are introduced. Expert opinion: Inkjet bioprinting technology is a promising tool for many biological and pharmaceutical applications. Several bottlenecks associated with this technology need to be addressed before commercialization. For example, sophisticated inks need to be synthesized to meet both biological and engineering restrictions. Further progress of parallel technologies will enhance the performance and functionality of the printers. It is also worth emphasizing that inkjet printing technologies must meet the requirement of regulatory agencies (e.g. the US Food & Drug Administration) for commercialization by the pharmaceutical industry.","[Machekposhti, Sina Azizi] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Mohaved, Saeid; Narayan, Roger J.] Univ N Carolina, Joint Dept Biomed Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Mohaved, Saeid; Narayan, Roger J.] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Narayan, RJ (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Joint Dept Biomed Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.; Narayan, RJ (reprint author), North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",rjnaraya@ncsu.edu,,,NCSU Community Engaged Faculty Fellow program; Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty Award at the Indian Institute of Technology-BHU; UNC Rajkumar Faculty Fellowship; Burroughs Welcome Fund Travel Grant; Technical University of Vienna; National Science Foundation; National Institute of Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals; National Institutes of Health; NCSU Adelaide Grant Program; NC Space Grant,"R Narayan is the recipient of fellowship funding from the NCSU Community Engaged Faculty Fellow program, the Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty Award at the Indian Institute of Technology-BHU, the UNC Rajkumar Faculty Fellowship and the Burroughs Welcome Fund Travel Grant with the Technical University of Vienna.

Indeed, bionic (from bion-, unit of life and -ic, like) materials have gained increasing attention in the last decades due to their ability to mimic some of the characteristics of nature systems, such as dynamism, selectivity, or signalling. However, there are still many challenges when it comes to their interaction with the human body, which hinder their further clinical development.

When placed in bone marrow, Ti-biomaterials integrate to the surrounding bone tissue by mechanisms that are not fully understood. We have previously identified an unexpected upregulation of circadian clock molecule neuronal PAS domain 2 (Npas2) in successfully integrated implant with a rough surface. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of osseointegration through determining the role of Npas2. Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) that were cultured on a Ti disc with SLA surface exhibited increased NPAS2 expression compared to BMSC cultured on a machined surface. A mouse model was developed in which miniature Ti implants were surgically placed into femur bone marrow. The implant push-out test and bone-to-implant contact measurements demonstrated the establishment of osseointegration in 3 weeks. By contrast, in Npas2 functional knockout (KO) mice, the implant push-out value measured for SLA surface Ti implant was significantly decreased. Npas2 KO mice demonstrated normal femur bone structure surrounding the Ti implant; however, the recovered implants revealed abnormal remnant mineralized tissue, which lacked dense collagen architecture typically found on recovered implants from wild type mice. To explore the mechanisms leading to the induced Npas2 expression, an unbiased chemical genetics analysis was conducted using mouse BMSC carrying an Npas2-reporter gene for high throughput screening of Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds. Npas2 modulating compounds were found clustered in regulatory networks of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor and its downstream cAMP/CREB signaling pathway. Mouse primary BMSC exposed to SLA Ti disc significantly increased the expression of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, but the expression of beta 2-adrenergic receptor was unaffected. Our data provides the first evidence that peripheral clock gene component Npas2 plays a role in facilitating the enhanced osseointegration through neuroskeletal regulatory pathways induced by BMSC in contact with rough surface Ti implant.","[Morinaga, Kenzo; Sasaki, Hodaka; Park, Sil; Hokugo, Akishige; Okawa, Hiroko; Nishimura, Ichiro] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Dent, Weintraub Ctr Reconstruct Biotechnol, Box 951668,CHS B3-087, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Morinaga, Kenzo] Fukuoka Dent Coll, Sect Oral Implantol, Dept Oral Rehabil, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Sasaki, Hodaka] Tokyo Dent Coll, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Implantol, Tokyo, Japan; [Hokugo, Akishige] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Dept Surg,Regenerat Bioengn & Repair Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Okawa, Hiroko] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Dent, Div Mol & Regenerat Prosthodont, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Tahara, Yu; Colwell, Christopher S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Nishimura, I (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Dent, Weintraub Ctr Reconstruct Biotechnol, Box 951668,CHS B3-087, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",inishimura@dentistry.ucla.edu,,,"Neobiotech, USA; National Center for Research Resources, National Institutes of Health (NCRR/NIFI) [C06 RR014529]","We thank Dr. Manabu Ishijima and Dr. Takahiro Ogwa of the Weintraub Center for Reconstructive Biotechnology, UCLA School of Dentistry for implant surface characterization.

Among several vaccination strategies, mucosal vaccines have wide clinical applications and attract considerable interest in research, showing potential as innovative and novel therapeutics. In mucosal vaccination, targeting (microfold) M cells is a frontline prerequisite for inducing effective antigen-specific immunostimulatory effects. In this review, we primarily focus on materials engineered for use as vaccine delivery platforms to target M cells. We also describe potential M cell targeting areas, methods to overcome current challenges and limitations of the field. Furthermore, we present the potential of biomaterials engineering as well as various natural and synthetic delivery technologies to overcome the challenges of M cell targeting, all of which are absent in current literature. Finally, we briefly discuss manufacturing and regulatory processes to bring a robust perspective on the feasibility and potential of this next-generation vaccine technology.","[Islam, Mohammad Ariful] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Nanomed, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Islam, Mohammad Ariful] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Firdous, Jannatul] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Badruddoza, Abu Zayed Md; Azad, Mohammad] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Reesor, Emma; Lim, Michael; Cao, Wuji; Guillemette, Simon] Univ Waterloo, Dept Nanotechnol Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Hasan, Anwarul] Qatar Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Doha 2713, Qatar; [Hasan, Anwarul] Qatar Univ, Biomed Res Ctr, Doha 2713, Qatar; [Cho, Chong Su] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Cho, Chong Su] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Islam, Mohammad Ariful] Immun Therapeut Inc, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Badruddoza, Abu Zayed Md] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Chem & Life Sci Engn, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Reesor, Emma] Univ Western Ontario, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON, Canada; [Azad, Mohammad] North Carolina A&T State Univ, Dept Chem Biol & Bioengn, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Cao, Wuji] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Islam, MA (reprint author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Nanomed, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Cho, CS (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, Seoul 08826, South Korea.; Cho, CS (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.; Islam, MA (reprint author), Immun Therapeut Inc, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",aislam@immunomix.com; chocs@snu.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2016936920]; Qatar National Research Foundation (QNRF) as a part of Qatar Foundation [NPRP9-144-3-021, NPRP10-0123-170-222]; Qatar University [GCC-2017-005]","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. 2016936920) (Cho CS), Qatar National Research Foundation (QNRF) as a part of Qatar Foundation grants NPRP9-144-3-021 and NPRP10-0123-170-222 (Hasan A) and the grant GCC-2017-005 (Hasan A) from Qatar University as part of the GCC research program.",,251,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,2019,192,,,,,,75.0,94,,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.10.041,,,,20,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,HJ1DL,WOS:000456902000006,30439573.0,,,,2019-02-25

However, commercial sealants have weak points in tissue adhesive, cell affinity, antibacterial etc., which make them remain suboptimal for internal use of body. It is required to develop multifunctional sealants that can meet clinical needs. Herein, a PEG-lysozyme (LZM) injectable sealant composed of 4-arm-PEG and lysozyme was developed. Lysozyme offers free amine groups to rapidly cross link with PEG. The hydrogel can tightly adhere to tissues and provide good mechanics to withstand high pressure. Moreover, lysozyme innately confers antibacterial and cell affinity on the hydrogel that are usually lacking in marketed sealants. The hydrogel is easily operated to seal gas or blood leakage in a rabbit trachea and artery defect. Moreover, it can close the transmural left ventricular wall defect on a beating heart. The traumatic organ functions completely recovered postoperatively. Considering the good biocompatibility and the simple fabrication process, the PEG-LZM hydrogel is promising to clinical transformation. More broadly, our work indicates that nature-occurring molecules are versatile building blocks for construction of materials and confer functions, which represents a simple tragedy to develop advanced functional biomaterials.","[Tan, Haoqi; Qu, Xue; Liu, Huan; Chen, Xin; Liu, Changsheng] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ultrafine Mat, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Jin, Dawei; Yin, Meng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Childrens Med Ctr, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 1678 Dong Fang Rd, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China","Qu, X; Liu, CS (reprint author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ultrafine Mat, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.; Yin, M (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Childrens Med Ctr, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 1678 Dong Fang Rd, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China.",quxue@ecust.edu.cn; yinmengmdphd@163.com; liucs@ecust.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31330028, 51621002, 51573047]; 111 project [B14018]; science and technology innovation project of Shanghai Science and Technique Committee [18441908300]; Collaborative Innovation Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine [TM201504]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory Polymer Molecular Engineering (Fudan University) [K2017-23]","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31330028, 51621002, 51573047), the 111 project (B14018), the science and technology innovation project of Shanghai Science and Technique Committee (18441908300), Collaborative Innovation Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (TM201504), the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory Polymer Molecular Engineering (Fudan University) (K2017-23).",,56,0,0,20,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,2019,192,,,,,,392.0,404,,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.10.047,,,,13,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,HJ1DL,WOS:000456902000032,30497024.0,,,,2019-02-25

Biomaterials-directed regenerative immunology is an immunoengineering strategy that targets the immune system to promote tissue repair. Biomaterial scaffolds employed in regenerative medicine can be broadly classified as biological (such as those derived from the tissue extracellular matrix) or synthetic. Here, we show in depth the divergent myeloid response to biological versus synthetic biomaterial scaffolds. While neutrophil depletion and changes in physical properties such as shape and mechanics can modulate the pro-inflammatory myeloid immune response to synthetic materials to a degree, the overall general divergent myeloid responses persist. Biologic scaffolds elicit a type-2-like immune response with upregulation of genes such as Il4, Cd163, Mrc1 and Chil3, as well as genes associated with damage-associated molecular patterns providing another possible mechanism by which ECM scaffolds promote wound healing via amplification of endogenous wound-associated signaling pathways. Synthetic materials recruit a high proportion of neutrophils which is compounded by material stiffness and by the presence of an injury. Understanding the complex immune response to biomaterial classes will help in the efficient design of immunoengineering strategies and optimizing regenerative and reducing foreign body fibrotic responses to scaffolds.","[Sadtler, Kaitlyn] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sadtler, Kaitlyn] Harvard Med Sch, Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Anesthesia & Crit Care Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wolf, Matthew T.; Moad, Christopher A.; Chung, Liam; Majumdar, Shoumyo; Elisseeff, Jennifer H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Translat Tissue Engn Ctr,Wilmer Eye Inst, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Ganguly, Sudipto; Chung, Liam; Housseau, Franck; Pardoll, Drew M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Oncol, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Wolf, Matthew T.; Ganguly, Sudipto; Moad, Christopher A.; Chung, Liam; Housseau, Franck; Pardoll, Drew M.; Elisseeff, Jennifer H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Bloomberg Kimmel Inst Canc Immunotherapy, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA","Elisseeff, JH (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Translat Tissue Engn Ctr,Wilmer Eye Inst, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA.",jhe@jhu.edu,,"Ganguly, Sudipto/0000-0002-2662-8897",Morton Goldberg Professorship; ACell Inc.; Bloomberg similar to Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy; NIH NIBIB Ruth L.

In order to harness the therapeutic potential of biomolecules secreted by platelets and stemmed from plasma, blood deconstruction has allowed to yield autologous platelet-and plasma derived protein fibrin scaffold. The autologous growth factors and microparticles stemmed from platelets and plasma, interact with fibrin, extracellular matrix, and tissue cells in a combinatorial, synergistic, and multidirectional way on mechanisms governing tissue repair. This interplay will induce a wide range of cell specifications during inflammation and repair process including but not limited to fibrogenesis, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. As biology-as-a-drug approach, autologous platelet-and plasma-derived protein fibrin scaffold is emerging as a safe and efficacious natural human-engineered growth factor delivery system to repair musculoskeletal tissues, and skin and corneal ulcers and burns. In doing so, it acts as therapeutic agent not perfect but close to biological precision. However, this autologous, biocompatible, biodegradable, and long in vivo lasting strategy faces several challenges, including its non-conventional single dose-response effect, the lack of standardization in its preparation and application, and the patient's biological features. In this review, we give an account of the main events of tissue repair. Then, we describe the procedure to prepare autologous platelet- and plasma-derived protein fibrin scaffolds, and the rationale behind these biomaterials, and finally, we highlight the significance of strategic accuracy in their application.","[Anitua, Eduardo; Prado, Roberto; Padilla, Sabino] Eduardo Anitua Fdn Biomed Res, Vitoria, Spain; [Anitua, Eduardo; Prado, Roberto; Padilla, Sabino] BTI Biotechnol Inst ImasD, C Jacinto Quincoces 39, Vitoria 01007, Spain; [Anitua, Eduardo; Prado, Roberto; Padilla, Sabino] Univ Basque Country, Fdn Eduardo Anitua, UIRMI, Univ Inst Regenerat Med & Oral Implantol, Vitoria, Spain; [Nurden, Paquita; Nurden, Alan T.] Inst Hosp Univ LIRYC, Hop Xavier Arnozan, Pessac, France","Padilla, S (reprint author), BTI Biotechnol Inst ImasD, C Jacinto Quincoces 39, Vitoria 01007, Spain.",sabino.padilla@bti-implant.es,,,,,,213,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,2019,192,,,,,,440.0,460,,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.029,,,,21,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,HJ1DL,WOS:000456902000036,30500725.0,,,,2019-02-25

Graphene materials are being delineated as alternative tools for neural repair. Herein, the regenerative ability of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) scaffolds to support pivotal features of neural repair at 4 months after SCI is assessed by an interdisciplinary approach. 3D randomly porous foams have been prepared in mechanical compliance with neural cells and tissues (Young's modulus of 1.3 +/- 1.0 kPa) as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy techniques applied ex vivo. After implantation, the significant increase in Young's modulus caused by massive cell/protein infiltration does not alter the mechanical performance of the contralateral spinal cord but provides mechanical stability to the lesion. These aerogels appear fully vascularized and populated with neurites, some of them being myelinated excitatory axons. Clinically-inspired magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrate that the scaffolds significantly reduce perilesional damage with respect to rats without implants and cause no compressive damage in the contralateral hemicord and rostral/caudal regions. The rGO implants do not either alter the rat spontaneous behaviour or induce toxicity in major organs. Finally, preliminary data suggest hints of rGO sheets dissociation and eventual degradation at the injured spinal cord for the first time. In summary, these 3D porous rGO scaffolds are able to induce, without any further biological functionalization, a compilation of positive effects that have been rarely described before, if ever, for any other material implanted in the injured spinal cord.","[Dominguez-Bajo, Ana; Guerrero, Carlos R.; Javier Palomares, F.; Garcia, Ricardo; Concepcion Serrano, Maria] CSIC, ICMM, Mat Sci Factory, Calle Sor Juana Ines Cruz 3, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Gonzalez-Mayorga, Ankor; Lopez-Dolado, Elisa] Hosp Nacl Paraplej, SESCAM, Lab Interfaces Neural Repair, Finca Peraleda S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Lopez-Dolado, Elisa] Joint Res Unit CSIC, HNP SESCAM, Res Unit Design & Dev Biomat Neural Regenerat, Madrid, Spain","Serrano, MC (reprint author), CSIC, ICMM, Mat Sci Factory, Calle Sor Juana Ines Cruz 3, Madrid 28049, Spain.",mc.terradas@csic.es,"Palomares, Francisco Javier/C-4605-2011","Palomares, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-4768-2219","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO/FEDER, UE) [MAT2016-78857-R, MAT2016-76507-R, MAT2016-80394-R]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (MINECO/FEDER, UE) [MAT2016-78857-R, MAT2016-76507-R, MAT2016-80394-R]; European Research Council [ERC-AdG-340177]","This work was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (MAT2016-78857-R, MAT2016-76507-R and MAT2016-80394-R, MINECO/FEDER, UE) and the European Research Council ERC-AdG-340177 (3DNanoMech).

However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unknown. Exosomes, a series of extracellular vesicles, have recently emerged as potential paracrine mediators in cell-cell communication. However, whether exosomes and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the chemical signals of biomaterials-modulated BMSCs-ECs communication are unknown. Hence, in the present study, a model Li-incorporated bioactive glass ceramic (Li-BGC) was applied to explore the chemical signals of biomaterials mediated cell-cell communication between BMSCs and ECs. Our results showed that Li-BGC directly promoted the pro-angiogenic capability of HUVECs in vitro and new blood vessel ingrowth in vivo. Moreover, Li-BGC activated Wnt/beta-catenin, AKT and NF-kappa B signaling pathways, while AKT signaling pathway might function as the upstream of Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. More importantly, Li-BGC further facilitated the pro-angiogenic capacity of HUVECs by eliciting the expression of exosomal pro-angiogenic miR-130a in BMSCs-derived exosomes, which subsequently leading to the downregulation of PTEN protein and activation of AKT pathway, ultimately resulting in the elevated proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells, as well as the upregulated expression of pro-angiogenic genes. Our findings may provide new insights into the regulatory roles of the chemical signals of biomaterials in BMSCs-ECs communication via stimulating exosomal miR-130a secretion and PTEN/AKT signaling pathway in the angiogenic process of bone remodelling.","[Liu, Lu; Fu, Runqing; Wu, Tingting; Yu, Fei; Wang, Xiaoting; Xia, Lunguo; Fang, Bing] Shanghai Liao Tong Univ, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 10, Dept Orthodont, Collage Stomatol,Sch Med, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yaqin; Feng, Chun; Chang, Jiang; Wu, Chengtie] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Ceram, State Key Lab High Performance Ceram & Superfine, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China","Xia, LG; Fang, B (reprint author), 500 Quxi Rd, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R China.; Wu, CT (reprint author), 1295 Dingxi Rd, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China.",xialunguo@hotmail.com; chengtiewu@mail.sic.ac.cn; fangbing@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1100201]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81671017, 81771115, 81870790, 5171101275]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [18441903600]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-SYS027]; Municipal Human Resources Development Program for Outstanding Young Talents in Medical and Health Sciences in Shanghai [2017YQ058]; Excellent Youth Program of Ninth People's Hospital [jyyq08201621]","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1100201), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81671017, 81771115, 81870790, 5171101275), Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (18441903600), Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDB-SSW-SYS027), Municipal Human Resources Development Program for Outstanding Young Talents in Medical and Health Sciences in Shanghai (2017YQ058), and Excellent Youth Program of Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine (jyyq08201621) for financial support.",,49,0,0,15,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-9612,1878-5905,,BIOMATERIALS,Biomaterials,FEB,2019,192,,,,,,523.0,536,,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.007,,,,14,"Engineering, Biomedical; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Engineering; Materials Science,HJ1DL,WOS:000456902000042,30529871.0,,,,2019-02-25

Ileal conduit (IC) is the dominant type of urinary diversion. Nevertheless, IC is not an ideal solution as the procedure still requires entero-enterostomy to restore the bowel continuity. This step is a source of relevant complications that might prolong recovery time. Fabrication of artificial urinary conduit is a tempting idea to introduce an alternative form of urinary diversion which might improve cystectomy outcomes. Area covered: The aim of this review is to discuss available research data about artificial urinary conduit and identify major challenges for future studies. Expert opinion: Fabrication of artificial urinary conduit is in range of current tissue engineering technology but there are still many challenges to overcome. There is an urgent need for studies to be conducted on large animal models with long follow up to expose the limitation of experimental strategies and to gather data for translational research.","[Adamowicz, Jan; Kloskowski, Tomasz; Pokrywczynska, Marta; Drewa, Tomasz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Coll Med, Dept Regenerat Med, Urol, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Van Breda, Shane V.] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Biomed, Basel, Switzerland; [Juszczak, Kajetan] Mem Rydygier Hosp, Dept Urol, Krakow, Poland","Adamowicz, J (reprint author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Univ Hosp, Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 9, PL-85094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",adamowicz.jz@gmail.com,,,,,,63,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-4440,1745-2422,,EXPERT REV MED DEVIC,Expert Rev.

Recently, artificial scaffolds such as Medpor (Stryker, Kalamasoo, MI, USA) have become widely used in ear reconstruction. However, the Medpor scaffold is stiffer than the natural ear, which may lead to discomfort, and moreover has uniform design for every patient. In this study, we investigated whether three-dimensional (3D)-printed artificial polyurethane (PU) scaffolds are suitable for auricular reconstruction. Methods PU scaffolds were fabricated using 3D printing according to a design derived from a digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) image of the human auricle. The microstructure of the scaffolds was observed using scanning electron microscopy, and the porosity was examined. Cell proliferation on the scaffolds was assessed in vitro using tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells to evaluate the biocompatibility of the scaffolds. The scaffolds were implanted in C57BL/6 mice, and histological analysis was performed. Results The structural study revealed that the 3D-printed porous PU scaffolds have rectangular microstructure with regular pitch and line, as well as high porosity (56.46% +/- 10.22%) with a pore diameter of 200 mu m. The mechanical properties of the 3D-printed PU scaffolds were similar to those of the human auricle cartilage. Cell proliferation on the PU scaffolds was greater than that on Medpor scaffolds. Histological evaluation demonstrated that the porous parts of the PU scaffolds became filled with collagen and vascular tissue. Conclusion Elastic, porous PU scaffolds can be obtained using 3D printing, have biomechanical properties similar to those of the natural ear, and are suitable for use in auricular reconstruction.","[Kim, Ha Yeong] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Mol Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Soo Yeon; Kim, Han Su] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Coll Med, Anyangcheon Ro 1071, Seoul 07985, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun Jung] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nanosci, Seoul, South Korea; [Truong, Minh-Dung] Ajou Univ, Dept Mol Sci & Technol, Suwon, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Jin] Wake Forest Sch Med, Wake Forest Inst Regenerat Med, Winston Salem, NC USA","Kim, HS (reprint author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Coll Med, Anyangcheon Ro 1071, Seoul 07985, South Korea.",sevent@ewha.ac.kr,,"Lee, Sang Jin/0000-0002-3899-1909","Korea Health Industry Development Institute - Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea [HI16C-2207-020017]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015R1D1A1A09058485]","This research was supported by a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, funded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI16C-2207-020017); and by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2015R1D1A1A09058485).

In this study, we report a scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)-based analytic technique to design and optimize metal ion-releasing bioactive glass (BAG) composites, which showed a significant reduction in biofilm growth. SECM allows positioning of the probe without touching the substrate while mapping the chemical parameters in 3-dimensional space above the substrate. Using SECM and a solid-state H+ and Ca2+ ion-selective microprobe, we determined that the local Ca2+ concentration released by different composites was 10 to 224 mu M for a BAG particle size of <5 to 150 mu m in the presence of artificial saliva at pH 4.5. The local pH was constant above the composites in the same saliva solution. The released amount of Ca2+ was determined to be maximal for particles <38 mu m and a BAG volume fraction of 0.32. This optimized BAG-resin composite also showed significant inhibition of biofilm growth (24 +/- 5 mu m) in comparison with resin-only composites (53 +/- 6 mu m) after Streptococcus mutans bacteria were grown for 3 d in a basal medium mucin solution. Biofilm morphology and its subsequent volume, as determined by the SECM imaging technique, was (0.59 +/- 0.38) x 10(7) mu m(3) for BAG-resin composites and (1.29 +/- 0.53) x 10(7) mu m(3) for resin-only composites. This study thus lays the foundation for a new analytic technique for designing dental composites that are based on the chemical microenvironment created by biomaterials to which bacteria have been exposed.","[Aponso, S.; Ummadi, J.

An in vitro experimental study was conducted on 90 dentin discs, cut out of freshly extracted human teeth. The discs were instrumented to obtain 1.3-mm lumen diameter. Then, they were randomly divided into six groups (n=15). Groups 1 and 4 subjected to diode laser (Wiser, Doctor Smile, Italy) (980nm, 1W, continuous mode) for 10s and filled with MTA and CEM cements. Groups 2 and 5 subjected to Er:YAG laser (Deka, Italy) (2940nm, 1W, 10Hz, 230s) for 10s and filled with MTA and CEM cements. Groups 3 and 6 (control groups) were filled with MTA and CEM cements without laser irradiation. After 7days, push-out bond strength test was performed using a universal testing machine in order to evaluate the adhesion of the biomaterials to dentin. The samples were evaluated under a light microscope at x40 magnification to determine the mode of fracture. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. The highest push-out bond strength (8.76 +/- 3.62MPa) was noted in group 1 (diode/MTA), which was significantly higher than the other groups (P<0.001). The lowest bond strength (2.61 +/- 0.81) was noted in group 6 (control/CEM). Diode laser significantly increased the bond strength of both cements (P<0.05), but Er:YAG laser irradiation only increased the bond strength of CEM and had no significant effect on MTA (P=0.603). The bond strength of MTA control group was higher than that of CEM control group (P=0.001). Push-out bond strength of endodontic cements can be affected by dentin conditioning with diode 980nm and Er:YAG laser. Nine hundred eighty-nanometer diode laser irradiation is recommended to increase the bond strength of endodontic cements particularly the CEM cement to dentin.","[Mohammadian, Fatemeh; Dibaji, Fatemeh; Sarraf, Pegah] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Dent, Dept Endodont, Tehran, Iran; [Chiniforush, Nasim] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Dent Res Inst, Laser Res Ctr Dent LRCD, Tehran, Iran; [Kharrazifard, Mohammad Javad] Dent Res Inst, Dent Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Kharrazifard, Mohammad Javad] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Dent, Stat & Methodol Dept, Tehran, Iran","Sarraf, P (reprint author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Dent, Dept Endodont, Tehran, Iran.",drmohammadianfatemeh@gmail.com; sorousht@yahoo.com; fmdibaji@gmail.com; sarraf_p@sina.tums.ac.ir; nasimch2002@yahoo.com; mj_khf@yahoo.com,,"Sarraf, Pegah/0000-0002-2432-7839; mohammadian, fatemeh/0000-0001-9995-1356","Tehran University of Medical Sciences, International Campus","The authors would like to thank Tehran University of Medical Sciences, International Campus for the support.",,41,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-8921,1435-604X,,LASER MED SCI,Lasers Med.

Long-term intermittent therapy by inhalable antibiotics has recently emerged as an effective approach for NCFB treatment. However, the effective delivery of antibiotics to the lung requires administering a high dose to the site of infection. Herein, we investigated the novel inhalable silk-based microparticles as a promising approach to deliver high-payload ciprofloxacin (CIP) for NCFB therapy. Silk fibroin (SF) was applied to improve drug-payload and deposit efficiency of the dry powder particles. Mannitol was added as a mucokinetic agent. The dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations of CIP microparticles were evaluated in vitro in terms of the aerodynamic performance, particle size distribution, drug loading, morphology, and their solid state. The optimal formulation (highest drug loading, 80%) exhibited superior aerosolization performance in terms of fine particle fraction (45.04 +/- 0.84%), emitted dose (98.10 +/- 1.27%), mass median aerodynamic diameter (3.75 +/- 0.03m), and geometric standard deviation (1.66 +/- 0.10). The improved drug loading was due to the electrostatic interactions between the SF and CIP by adsorption, and the superior aerosolization efficiency would be largely attributed to the fluffy and porous cotton-like property and low-density structure of SF. The presented results indicated the novel inhalable silk-based DPI microparticles of CIP could provide a promising strategy for the treatment of NCFB.","[Liu, Chunxia; Lv, Li; Yu, Xiaoxia; Li, Guocheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Mem Hosp, Dept Pharm, 132 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chunxia; Wu, Qiaoli; Li, Guocheng] Zengcheng Dist Peoples Hosp Guangzhou, Dept Pharm, Guangming East Rd, Guangzhou 511300, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Ling; Huang, Zhengwei; Quan, Guilan; Wu, Chuanbin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, 132 Waihuandong Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Junhuang] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Coll Pharm, Benxi 117004, Peoples R China","Li, GC (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Mem Hosp, Dept Pharm, 132 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Li, GC (reprint author), Zengcheng Dist Peoples Hosp Guangzhou, Dept Pharm, Guangming East Rd, Guangzhou 511300, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Quan, GL (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, 132 Waihuandong Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",quanglan@mail.sysu.edu.cn; lgcwx@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81503001]; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2016A030313330]; Guangdong Province Science and Technology Plan Project Public Welfare Fund and Ability Construction Project [2017A020215081, 2016A020215069, 2016A020215063]; Science and Technology Foundation of Guangzhou [201707010103]; Yixian Scientific Research Project Set Sail [YXQH201706]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81503001), Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2016A030313330), Guangdong Province Science and Technology Plan Project Public Welfare Fund and Ability Construction Project (Grant No. 2017A020215081, Grant No. 2016A020215069, Grant No. 2016A020215063), the Science and Technology Foundation of Guangzhou (Grant No. 201707010103), and Yixian Scientific Research Project Set Sail (Grant No. YXQH201706).",,46,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1530-9932,,,AAPS PHARMSCITECH,AAPS PharmSciTech,FEB,2019,20,2,,,,,,,85,10.1208/s12249-019-1291-5,,,,11,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HI5QY,WOS:000456510200002,30673901.0,,,,2019-02-25

Traditional approaches based on seeding cells into scaffold are limited in their capacity to produce tissues with precise biomimetic properties. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is one kind of fabrication technology used to precisely dispense cell-laden biomaterials for the construction of functional tissues or organs. In recent years, much research progress has been made in 3D bioprinting technology and its application in generating tissue analogs, including skin, heart valves, blood vessels, bone, and cardiac tissue. However, it still faces many technical challenges. In this review, we introduce the current progress in 3D bioprinting technology and focus on biomaterials and their potential applications in regenerative medicine and drug discovery.

In this research, electrospun PVA/Chitosan/Starch nanofibrous mats were fabricated using electrospinning method for wound dressing application. The prepared nanofibrous mats were then cross-linked to enhanced the water resistance and also optimize the biodegradation rate followed by characterization and evaluation of their properties as wound dressings. The morphological studies performed by SEM and AFM showed that uniform bead-free electrospun nanofibrous mats were formed. The structural properties of the fabricated mats were characterized by FTIR The proper porosity and balanced water absorption and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of obtained dressings, demonstrate their ability in providing suitable moist environment for wound, result in the appropriate wound breathing and simultaneously efficient handling of wound exudates. Suitable mechanical properties of nanofibrous dressing in both dry and wet states confirm the capability of fabricated wound dressing to protect wound area against the external forces during the healing process. Antibacterial test revealed excellent antibacterial activity of nanofibrous mats against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxicity evaluated by MTT assay, proved appropriate cytocompatibility and cell viability of the developed nanofibrous mats which were also verified with in vitro wound healing analysis performed by scratch assay, confirming the remarkable potential of the investigated nanofibrous mats for wound dressing application.

Synthesized whitlockite nano particles and nanocomposite hydrogels were characterized using SEM, TEM, EDS and MR Developed hydrogels were injectable, mechanically stable, cytocompatible and has better protein adsorption. Incorporation of dimethyloxallylglycine resulted in initial burst release followed by sustained release for 7 days. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to dimethyloxallylglycine incorporated nanocomposite hydrogel showed enhanced cell migration and capillary tube-like structure formation. Osteogenic differentiation in rat adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells after 7 and 14 days revealed increased levels of alkaline phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, cells exposed to nanocomposite hydrogel revealed enhanced protein expressions of RUNX2, COL and OPN.

To improve its certain limitations such as poor biocompatibility and easy agglomeration during application as biomaterials and promote its performance as photothermal agent in biomedical fields, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified molybdenum oxide was synthesized and the synthesis conditions during the hydrothermal process, including the pH values and the amount of PEG added, were adjusted. Owing to the reduction function of PEG, as-obtained PEG-MoOx showed good photostability and colloidal stability, which were beneficial to its application in long-term clinical photothermal therapy. In addition, cell experiments indicated that PEG-MoOx particles exhibited low cytotoxicity and ability of photothermal killing for HeLa cells. With the increase PEG-MoOx particles in solution, the photothermal ablation ability of PEG-MoOx particles for the HeLa cells was enhanced under an 808-nm NIR laser irradiation.

Precise delivery to targeted tissues was clearly demonstrated by an in vivo near-infrared imaging assay. The therapeutic potential was evaluated in both rat hindlimb ischemia and mouse acute kidney injury models. Targeted delivery of NO clearly enhanced its therapeutic efficacy in tissue repair and function recovery and abolished side effects due to the systemic release of NO.

Prepare azido-terminated star-shaped PCL, azido-terminated PEG, alkyne-terminated PEG, and propargylated pentaerythritol were characterized by hydrogen-1 proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The morphology and thermal behavior of the APCNs were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The swelling behavior of APCNs could be manipulated through an establishment of a balance between hydrophilic segments, hydrophobic segments, and cross-linking density. The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide was entrapped in APCNs as a model agrochemical to study the release profile from APCNs. The obtained results showed that the release of 2,4-D could be controlled by the swelling degree of APCNs. Finally, the biodegradability rates of APCNs were investigated in agricultural soil. The results exhibited that the decrease in the swelling degree led to decreased degradation rate of APCNs. According to obtained results, these APCNs could be used as biomaterials for the controlled release of agrochemicals.","[Dabbaghi, Alaleh; Rahmani, Sohrab] Univ Zanjan, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Lab Polymer Synth, Zanjan, Iran","Rahmani, S (reprint author), Univ Zanjan, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Lab Polymer Synth, Zanjan, Iran.",rahmani.sohrab@znu.ac.ir,,,University of Zanjan,University of Zanjan,,47,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1042-7147,1099-1581,,POLYM ADVAN TECHNOL,Polym.

In this study, the reaction between NaCl solution and MgO is simplified as the first stage of the degradation of magnesium alloy stent, and the adsorption properties of NaCl solution on the MgO surface are investigated by MD simulation. The distribution of each component of the solution perpendicular to the MgO surface is analysed and the diffusion coefficient is calculated. Besides, a parameterised analysis is carried out. The results show that there is a solution layer formed at the surface of the MgO, and the existence of metal oxide restricts the diffusion of the solution. The adsorption capacity and the diffuse rate have an opposite variation tendency with the change of temperature, concentration and velocity. The self-diffusion coefficient of the solution increases with the increase in temperature as well as velocity, inversely adsorption capacity decreases with the increase in velocity. Besides, the influence of temperature on the adsorption capacity is small. What is more, the diffusion coefficient decreases while the adsorption capacity increases with the increase in concentration.","[Tang, Xiaoli; Bian, Qingfei; Wang, Qiuwang; Zeng, Min] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Minist Educ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Key Lab Thermofluid Sci & Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zeng, M (reprint author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Minist Educ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Key Lab Thermofluid Sci & Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zengmin@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Qiuwang/0000-0001-9664-7121",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51776157]; Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51721004],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51776157) and the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51721004).,,43,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0026-8976,1362-3028,,MOL PHYS,Mol.

Analysis of the microstructure of the composite particle evaluates the 3D surface luminance structure and the profile structure. Cross-sectional views of the specimens are extracted and analysed, and the surface roughness, waviness profile, and Gaussian filter of the structures are observed. In summary the structures are checked and analysed by SEM and EDS where possible, to observe the bioactive behaviour of the materials.

These results suggested that the astaxanthin incorporated collagen film (ACF) and gentamicin incorporated collagen film (GCF) exhibited excellent wound healing activity (71%) in both full thickness excision and linear incision in rats. The in-vitro antioxidant abilities of extracted astaxanthin exhibited strongly significant 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. In addition, tensile strength, epithelialization, hydroxyproline content and protein content in ACF and GCF treated groups were significantly increased. Histopathological assessment revealed an increase in collagen content, fibroblasts, granulation, thickness of scar formation, effective neovascularization and faster epithelialization within the short duration after the treatment of ACF and GCF compared to the control groups. The structure of prepared ACF and GCF biomaterials were characterized by SEM, EDS, and XRD. The in vivo biological study of the collagen-based film releases the antibiotic substance. The composite of collagen based biomaterials displays a promising biocompatibility through the dermal wound healing process as well as an evidence of biodegradability. Thus, the marine-derived biomaterials gave a substantial pledge for the development of biodegradable materials in drug delivery and soft tissue regeneration process.","[Veeruraj, Anguchamy; Liu, Ling; Zheng, Jiexia; Wu, Jianping] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, FIFS, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Veeruraj, Anguchamy; Arumugam, Muthuvel] Annamalai Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Ctr Adv Study Marine Biol, Parangipettai 608502, Tamil Nadu, India; [Veeruraj, Anguchamy; Wu, Jianping] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, ZJU UA Joint Lab Mol Nutr & Bioact Peptides, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianping] Univ Alberta, Dept Agr Food & Nutr Sci, 4-10 Ag Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P5, Canada","Veeruraj, A (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, ZJU UA Joint Lab Mol Nutr & Bioact Peptides, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",anguveeruraj@gmail.com,,,DST; Ministry of Earth Sciences Govt. of India (MOES) under Ocean & Atmosphere Science and Technology Cell (OASTC),"The authors are grateful to DST sponsored 'National Facility for Marine Natural Products and Drug Discovery Research Laboratory', Faculty of Marine Sciences, Parangipettai and authorities of Annamalai University for providing the necessary facilities.

Effective treatments for acute and chronic skin wounds are the focus of intensive research. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a natural proteinaceous by-product of the food industry and is suitable for biomedical applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate processed eggshell membrane powder (PEP) for the promotion of skin wound healing. PEP was characterized using proteomics and bioinformatics. Proteomic analysis of PEP identified 110 proteins, including structural proteins such as collagen and cysteine-rich eggshell membrane proteins (CREMPs) that together constitute about 40% of PEP. Functional annotation clustering showed various predicted functionalities related to wound healing including response to external stimulus, defense response, inflammatory response, and cell-substrate adhesion. The impact of PEP on wound healing was determined using the mouse excisional wound splinting model with a subsequent assessment by histopathology. PEP was found to significantly accelerate wound closure at days 3, 7, and 10. Histological assessment showed significantly thicker granulation tissue in wounds treated with PEP than non-treated controls at days 10 and 17. In addition, histological scoring showed higher levels of collagen deposition at day 10 in wounds treated with PEP, with limited inflammatory reaction. Therefore, PEP is a biocompatible and non-cytotoxic biomaterial that has great potential for development into a cost-effective wound healing product.","[Ahmed, Tamer A.

Despite its potential anti-cancer activity, solubility of curcumin is very low rendering its limit in application. We have used GA microspheres where curcumin can be loaded comfortably and thereby increases its bioavailability. The cytotoxicity of curcumin encapsulated GA microspheres was evaluated on triple negative breast cancer cell lines. They were found to induce apoptosis by perturbing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Folic acid was conjugated to curcumin encapsulated GA microspheres, for delivering it specifically to the cancer cells. The in-vivo study in BALB/C mice model exhibited more tumor regression in case of folic acid targeted curcumin encapsulated GA microsphere.

Therefore the development of highly aligned electrospun scaffolds based on polycaprolactone (PCL) and collagen enables a versatile development towards tailor made applications. However, the application of natural polymers like collagen brings the risk of batch-to-batch inconsistencies, which influence the reproducibility of the electrospinning process. Aligned PCL-Collagen nanofibers were fabricated via electrospinning using benign solvents. The spinnability of different collagen batches and polymer concentrations in diluted acetic acid as solvent was investigated. Furthermore spinning parameters and fiber morphology were investigated in order to determine the most stable spinning conditions and analyze the batch-to-batch variations.

Immersion tests (weight loss measurements) and electrochemical measurements were conducted in two different pseudo-physiological solutions, simulated body fluid (SBF) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) solution. By the comparison study in these two different solutions, more information and the mechanism of the degradation process can be revealed. Degradation morphologies (with and without ultrasonication treatment) were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and degradation products on the surface were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the biocompatibility of iron surfaces after being ultrasonicated was evaluated. Ultrasonication was found to accelerate the degradation rate in DMEM, while it makes no difference in SBF solution; the origin of this different behavior is investigated and discussed. The parameters of the ultrasonication treatment, intensity and frequency, show an influence on the degradation rate. No adverse effects on the proliferation and adhesion of human osteoblast-like cells (MG-63) are observed on surfaces after ultrasonication treatment, as compared to bare iron. Based on these results, ultrasonication treatment is considered to have high potential to control the biodegradation behavior of iron-based materials in an external and flexible manner.","[Zhou, Juncen; Bruns, Mark; Yang, Yuyun; Virtanen, Sannakaisa] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Inst Surface Sci & Corros, Erlangen, Germany; [Fink, Michael; Ermert, Helmut] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Sensor Technol, Erlangen, Germany; [Yang, Yuyun; Detsch, Rainer; Boccaccini, Aldo R.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Inst Biomat, Erlangen, Germany; [Yang, Yuyun] Harbin Engn Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Chem Engn, Inst Surface Interface Sci & Technol, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Virtanen, S (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Inst Surface Sci & Corros, Erlangen, Germany.",virtanen@ww.uni-erlangen.de,,"Zhou, Juncen/0000-0002-7615-3543; Yang, Yuyun/0000-0002-7331-1454","China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201406990028, 201308230074];  [HEUCFJ181004]",Juncen Zhou (Grant 201406990028) and Yuyun Yang (Grant 201308230074) gratefully acknowledge the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for financial support.

SrHA was synthesized in presence of different Sr concentrations (SrHA5; SrHA10) and HA-AL nanocrystals at increasing bisphosphonate (BP) content (HA-AL7; HA-AL28). Methods: A posterolateral spinal fusion model in twenty-five Sham operated and in twenty-five OVX female rats was used and materials were bilaterally implanted between transverse processes of lumbar vertebrae. Sham and OVX animals were divided in five groups depending on the material: HA, SrHA5, SrHA10, HA-AL7 and HA-AL28. The assessment of bone fusion was carried out by mu CT, histology and histomorphometry. Results: Some gaps between the transverse processes were observed by mu CT in OVX-HA group, while they were not present in all the other groups. These results were consistent with the histomorphometrical analyses showing that in OVX animals SrHA and HA-AL materials displayed significantly higher BV/TV and Tb.Th and significantly lower Tb.N and Tb.Sp in comparison with HA alone. Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that in spinal fusion the incorporation of bioactive ions or drugs as Sr and AL improves the biological performance of HA representing a promising strategy especially in osteoporosis patients with high risks of spinal fusion failure. Results also suggest the existence of a Sr and AL dose response effect and that HA containing the highest AL dose could be the candidate biomaterial for spinal fusion in osteoporotic subjects.","[Salamanna, Francesca; Giavaresi, Gianluca; Torricelli, Paola; Fini, Milena] Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Lab Preclin & Surg Studies, Via Barbianao 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Parrilli, Annapaola] Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Dept RIT Rizzoli, Lab Biocompatibil Technol Innovat & Adv Therapies, Via Barbiano 1-10, Bologna, Italy; [Boanini, Elisa; Bigi, Adriana] Univ Bologna, Dept Chem G Ciamician, Via Selmi 2, Bologna, Italy","Giavaresi, G (reprint author), Rizzoli Orthoped Inst, Lab Preclin & Surg Studies, Via Barbianao 1-10, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",francesca.salamanna@ior.it; gianluca.giavaresi@ior.it; annapaola.parrilli@ior.it; paola.torricelli@ior.it; elisa.boanini@unibo.it; adriana.bigi@unibo.it; milena.fini@ior.it,"Salamanna, Francesca/J-6032-2016; Bigi, adriana/R-6341-2016; Parrilli, Annapaola/C-7008-2019","Salamanna, Francesca/0000-0001-7402-4054; Bigi, adriana/0000-0003-2668-8627; Parrilli, Annapaola/0000-0003-0251-5094; Giavaresi, Gianluca/0000-0001-7843-5969","Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute (Ricerca Corrente); ""Cinque x mille 2010"" funds; FIRE [RBAP10MLK7];  [COST-MP 1301]","This work was supported by Grants from Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute (Ricerca Corrente), ""Cinque x mille 2010"" funds and by FIRE RBAP10MLK7 ""Scaffold per la rigenerazione dei tessuti scheletrici: valutazione preclinica della loro compatibility ed efficienza"".

The data collected from microCT is utilized for adequately defining the mechanical properties of the FE model. In particular, the three-dimensional field of grey values is interpreted in terms of the underlying field of attenuation coefficients, taking into account the photon energy employed in microCT imaging, eventually allowing for calculation of the three-dimensionally distributed, voxel-specific composition of the studied material. For the sake of keeping the FE simulations as efficient as possible, groups of voxels are combined into one finite element; the grey value of the latter is obtained by volume averaging. Employing a two-step micromechanical homogenization scheme, the experimentally accessible stiffness of the three constituents (PHBV, PLGA, and TCP) is then, finite element by finite element, upscaled to the composition-dependent stiffness of the composite material. The plausibility and adequacy of the FE model is demonstrated by simulating the effects of uniaxial compression on the scaffold structure, in terms of resulting stress and strain fields, highlighting the importance of the fiber junctions (as they are the mechanically most stressed regions), and that neglecting the material heterogeneity would lead to a potentially significant underestimation of stresses and strains. Finally, a comparison is made of the employed analysis modality of microCT data with a previously pursued, simplified analysis strategy, highlighting the conceptual superiority of the former, and pointing out the application limits of the latter.","[Szlazak, Karol; Jaroszewicz, Jakub; Idaszek, Joanna; Swieszkowski, Wojciech] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Warsaw, Poland; [Vass, Viktoria; Hasslinger, Patricia; Dejaco, Alexander; Scheiner, Stefan; Hellmich, Christian] TU Wien Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Mech Mat & Struct, Vienna, Austria","Scheiner, S (reprint author), TU Wien Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Mech Mat & Struct, Vienna, Austria.",stefan.scheiner@tuwien.ac.at,,"Swieszkowski, Wojciech/0000-0003-4216-9974; Jaroszewicz, Jakub/0000-0002-5037-8082",COST action NEWGEN New Generation Biomimetic and Customized Implants for Bone Engineering [MP1301]; National Centre for Research and Development of Poland [Pol-Nor/202132/68/2013]; National Science Centre of Poland [DEC-2012/07/D/ST8/02606],"The authors gratefully acknowledge COST action NEWGEN New Generation Biomimetic and Customized Implants for Bone Engineering (MP1301), in the framework of which the first author of this paper could undertake a short-term scientific mission (STSM) at Vienna University of Technology.

Nacre's self-assembly characteristics are concerned about the development of calcite filled biomineralized scaffold following the nature based biomineralization process and biomimetic applications. The PVP-CMC hydrogel film, comprised of PVP:0.2, CMC:0.8, PEG:1.0, Agar:2.0, Glycerene:1.0 and water:95.0 w/v%; acts as catalyst and template for the nucleation and growth of the inorganic CaCO3 within the scaffold. The PVP-CMC hydrogel (in the dry state) was immersed in ionic solutions (g/100 ml) of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 center dot H2O in different concentrations sets i.e. Set-1: 10.50/14.70; Set-2: 5.25/7.35; Set-3: 4.20/5.88; Set-4: 2.10/2.94; Set-5: 1.05/1.47, Set-6: 0.55/0.55 for 90 min. As a result, ""PVP-CMC-CaCO3"" hydrogel scaffold was fabricated having bio-inspired structural and functional properties. Cell proliferation and cell viability were examined until 7 days in the presence of ""PVP-CMC-CaCO3"" scaffolds using permanent cell lines MG63 (human osteosarcoma), L929 (murine fibroblasts) as well as cultures from mouse bone explants (CC-MBE), confirmed that the said hydrogel scaffolds are biocompatible. But, from mechanical strength as well as biocompatibility point of view, scaffolds prepared in Set-1 to 3 ionic solutions were superior. In conclusion, these three calcite filled hydrogel scaffolds are recommended and can be used for osseointegration.","[Saha, Nabanita; Shah, Rushita; Saha, Petr] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Ctr Polymer Syst, Tr T Bati 5678, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Gupta, Prerak; Mandal, Biman B.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Biomat & Tissue Engn Lab, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India; [Alexandrova, Radostina] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Morphol Pathol & Anthropol Museum, Dept Pathol, Acad Georgi Bonchev Str,Bl 25, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria; [Sikiric, Maja Dutour] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Dept Phys Chem, Bijenicka Cesta 54, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Saha, N (reprint author), Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Ctr Polymer Syst, Tr T Bati 5678, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",nabanita@utb.cz,,"SAHA, NABANITA/0000-0002-7549-2260","Tomas Bata University in Zlin [IGA/FT/2014/015]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-Program NPUI [LO1504]; Fund ""Scientific Research"", Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science [(sic)02-30/2014]; Department of Biotechnology (DBT); Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India; COST Action [MP1301]","This work is supported by an internal grant from Tomas Bata University in Zlin (IGA/FT/2014/015) and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-Program NPUI (LO1504).

These new cells are capable of providing trophic cues to support residual host populations and/or replace those cells lost to the primary insult. However, issues with low-level adult neurogenesis, cell survival, directed differentiation and inadequate reinnervation of host tissue have impeded the full potential of these therapeutic approaches and their clinical advancement. Biomaterials offer novel approaches to stimulate endogenous neurogenesis, as well as for the delivery and support of neural progenitor transplants, providing a tissue-appropriate physical and trophic milieu for the newly integrating cells.

To achieve various benefits, lutein-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-phospholipid (PL) nanocapsules were prepared. Lutein-PLGA NCs (+PL) were synthesized, characterized and itsbioavailability was studied in vitro and in vivo. The cellular uptake and anti-proliferative activity were analyzed in Hep G2 cells. The mean size and zeta value of lutein-PLGA NCs (+PL) were 140 +/- 6nm and -44mV. The amorphous nature of lutein in PLGA NCs (+PL) was confirmed by XRD and DSC. In vitro lutein release kinetics showed an initial burst followed by sustainable release up to 86%. In vitro bioavailability showed 62.7% higher lutein bioaccessibility than lutein in free form. The AUC of lutein after single oral dose of lutein-PLGA NCs (+PL) revealed 3.91-fold (plasma), 2.89-fold (liver), and 3.12-fold (eyes) higher absorption than the control (mixed micelles). The IC50 of lutein-PLGA NCs (+PL) in Hep G2 cells at 72h was 4.5M as opposed to 23.4M for lutein in free form. Thus, results reveal that PL added to PLGA NCs helps in enhancing the solubility which in turn resulted in its better bioavailability and bioefficacy.","[Ranganathan, Arunkumar; Baskaran, Vallikannan] CSIR, Cent Food Technol Res Inst, Dept Biochem, Mysore 570020, Karnataka, India; [Ranganathan, Arunkumar] Univ Utah, John A Moran Eye Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Manabe, Yuki; Sugawara, Tatsuya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Appl Biosci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Hirata, Takashi] Shijonawategakuen Univ, Dept Rehabil, Osaka 5740011, Japan; [Shivanna, Naveen] DRDO Def Food Technol Res Inst, Dept Appl Microbiol, Mysore 570011, Karnataka, India","Baskaran, V (reprint author), CSIR, Cent Food Technol Res Inst, Dept Biochem, Mysore 570020, Karnataka, India.",baskaranv@cftri.res.in,,"Manabe, Yuki/0000-0002-5663-0074","Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India (DST) [INT/JSPS/P-122/11]","This research project was financially supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India (DST, INT/JSPS/P-122/11)",,34,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-393X,2190-3948,,DRUG DELIV TRANSL RE,Drug Deliv.

In order to implement them into highly efficient triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) applications, the contact electrode should be cheap, flexible, able to withstand outdoor environments, and have a rough surface. Here, microwave-welded single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are shown to effectively harvest the mechanical vibrational energy from biomaterials and bioproducts. Selective and flash microwave heating provides firm welding of SWCNTs to a polycarbonate substrate without significant losses in flexibility, transparency, and electrical conductivity. Microwave-welded SWCNT electrodes were successfully deployed as single-electrode TENGs to harvest energy from cellulose film, hanji paper, and cherry leaf. The cellulose- and paper-based TENGs showed the quite stable triboelectric outputs even after excessive contacts and a long period of time. The leaf-based TENG showed the significantly modified triboelectric outputs due to the moisture evaporation induced shrinkage and roughness of the surface. The SWCNT electrode generated ca. ten- and two-fold larger voltage and current, respectively, than those obtained using an indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode. Using a fan-shaped leaf-based TENG, multiple light emitting diodes and a cellular phone were successfully powered without a battery. This work implies that the microwave-welded SWCNT electrode with rough pored surface and strong resistance against environmental shocks could be a good candidate for the outdoor biomaterials and indoor bioproducts implemented TENGs to harness random- and low-frequency vibrational energy.","[Kim, Hyun Soo; Kim, Dong Yeong; Kim, Do Hyung; Lee, Dong Woo; Kong, Dae Sol; Jung, Jong Hoon] Inha Univ, Quantum Funct Mat Lab, Dept Phys, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Kwak, Ji Hye; Park, Jinhong; Jung, Sunshin] Korea Electrotechnol Res Inst, Elect Environm Res Ctr, Chang Won 51543, South Korea; [Kim, Jong Hun; Lee, Gwan-Hyoung] Yonsei Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Choi, Moonkang; Lee, Minbaek] Inha Univ, Smart Nanodevice Lab, Dept Phys, Incheon 22212, South Korea","Jung, JH (reprint author), Inha Univ, Quantum Funct Mat Lab, Dept Phys, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",jhjung@inha.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, ICT & Future Planning [2016R1A2B4014134, 2017M2B2A4049475, 2016M3A7B4910940, 2017R1A5A1014862]; Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) Primary Research Program through the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST) - Ministry of Science and ICT","The authors would like to thank Prof. B.-H.

After decellularizing Papio hamadryas esophagus and studying the morphology and physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), we generated electrospun polyamide-6 based scaffolds to mimic it. The scaffolds supported a greater mechanical load than the native ECM and demonstrated similar 3D microstructure, with randomly aligned fibers, 90% porosity, 29 mu m maximal pore size, and average fiber diameter of 2.87 +/- 0.95 mu m. Biocompatibility studies showed that human adipose- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSC and BMD-MSC) adhered to the scaffold surface and showed some proliferation: scaffold cell coverage was 25% after 72 h of incubation when seeded with 1000 cells/mm(2); cells elongated processes along the polyamide-6, although they flattened 1.67-4 times less than on cell culture plastic. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, however, showed poor adherence and proliferation. We thus provide in vitro evidence that polyamide-6 scaffolds approximating the esophageal biomechanics and 3D topography of nonhuman primates may provide a biocompatible substrate for both AD-MSC and BMD-MSCs, supporting their adhesion and survival to some degree.

We fabricated poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) blend films by solution casting. Formulation c with average glass transition temperature of 37.6 +/- 1.2 degrees C was chosen for temporospatial recovery. Favorable results from surface studies reflected homogeneous dispersion of polymers in the blend. The cytotoxicity was studied in human foreskin fibroblasts. The blend film was cytocompatible, evidenced by matching percentage of live cells in exposed and control solutions. Subsequently, liquid water permeability experiments confirmed watertight nature of films. Finally, in vitro degradation was investigated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and amniotic fluid (AF) separately for 16 weeks. Similar weight loss (n = 6, p = 0.912) and significantly different (n = 3, p = 0.025) surface roughness was observed in PBS and AF, respectively, at 16 weeks. Functional group analysis displayed increasing carbonyl and hydroxyl bonds in PBS and AF, respectively, over time, indicating progression of hydrolytic degradation. Favorable characterization results provide strong evidence to employ PLA-PCL blend films as surgical patches in fetoscopic MMC repair. Designed patch serves as standalone system to successfully tackle impending hurdles of MMC repair and proves to be a superior alternative compared to existing patches.

However, synthetic bioinks do not generally possess high printability and biocompatibility at the same time. So, there is an urgent need for naturally derived bioinks that can exhibit such optimized properties. We used furfuryl-gelatin as a novel, visible-light crosslinkable bioink for fabricating cell-laden structures with high viability. Hyaluronic acid was added as a viscosity enhancer and either Rose Bengal or Riboflavin was used as a visible-light crosslinker. Crosslinking was done by exposing the printed structure for 2.5 min to visible light and confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and rheometry. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a highly porous networked structure. Three different cell types were successfully bioprinted within these constructs. Mouse mesenchymal stem cells printed within monolayer and bilayer sheets showed viability, network formation and proliferation (similar to 5.33 times) within 72 h of culture. C2C12 and STO cells were used to print a double layered structure, which showed evidence of the viability of both cells and heterocellular clusters within the construct. This furfuryl-gelatin based bioink can be used for tissue engineering of complex tissues and help in understanding how cellular crosstalk happens in vivo during normal or diseased pathology.

While biologically similar in morphology, soft, and flexible hydrogel materials have low mechanical properties. For applications in tissue engineering, the lack of directional cues and attachment regions within the biogels is undesired as cells require a guide for adequate attachment and organized proliferation. In this work, we have investigated the role of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fiber length and concentration as a reinforcement phase in a gelatin hydrogel matrix and the resultant mechanical and cellular responses. With increasing fiber length and concentration, the ultimate tensile strength, modulus, and toughness increased for the samples. Similarly, for shorter fiber lengths, the loss and storage modulus increased with fiber concentration. After seeding human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) onto the neat fibrous scaffolds it was found that the fabrication process imparted no cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it was the concentrations and lengths of fiber both caused discernable differences in cell viability at the extreme values. Fibers of all lengths, when in a 4.0 wt % concentration, had a decrease in cell viability after 10 days while the 12.7 mm fibers showed a similar response at 2.0 wt %, but all stayed about 90% viability. With increased incubation time, hMSCs became elongated with increased proliferation. These results indicate that the wet-lay process is a rapid and scalable method by which fibrous 3D-scaffolds can be produced to reinforce hydrogel matrices. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Granules can be prepared with a grinder from trabecular bone samples or provided as synthetic biomaterials by industry. Granules occupy the 3D-space and create a macroporosity allowing invasion of vascular and bone cells when the inter-granular pores are larger than 300 mu m. We compared the 3D-porosity of granule stacks obtained or prepared with nine biomaterials Osteopure((R)), Lubboc (R), Bio-Oss (R), CopiOs (R), TCP Dental (R), TCP Dental HP (R), KeraOs (R), and TCH (R) in comparison with that of human trabecular bone. For each biomaterial, two sizes of granules were analyzed: 250-1000 and 1000-2000 mu m. Microcomputed tomography determined porosity and microarchitectural characteristics of granular stacks and Raman microspectroscopy was used to analyze their composition. Stacks of 250-1000 mu m granules had a much lower porosity than 1000-2000 mu m granules and the maximum frequency of pores was always centered at 200-250 mu m. One biomaterial contained substantial amount of cortical bone (Bio-Oss (R)). The highest porosity and pore size was obtained with TCP Dental HP. Raman spectroscopy found differences in biomaterials of the same composition. Stacks of granules represent 3D scaffolds resembling trabecular bone with an interconnected porous microarchitecture. Small granules have created pores <300 mu m in diameter; this can interfere with vascular colonization. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were employed for modeling and optimizing the electrophoretic deposition parameters of chitosan concentration, deposition potential, and agitation speed. The mutual effects of these parameters on the responses (deposition yield and E-corr) have been analyzed and displayed by response surface plots. Predicted and experimental values agreed well with each other. The average absolute errors between experimental and predicted values were calculated as 2.0 and 2.2pct for response-1 (deposition yield) and response-2 (E-corr), respectively. A 5-level-3-factor experimental design has been utilized to optimize electrophoretic deposition parameters. According to deposition yield and E-corr models, optimized values were for chitosan concentration: 2.57 and 2.59 g/L, for deposition potential: 16.09 and 16.25 V, and for agitation speed: 247 and 229 rpm, respectively. The findings of this research suggest that statistical design methodologies (i.e., RSM and CCD) may effectively be employed for the modeling and optimizing of multi-electrophoretic deposition parameters. These results are encouraging and may be practiced for functionalization of Ti6Al4V biomedical implant devices to provide better in vivo biocompatibility performance.","[Tozar, Ali; Karahan, Ismail Hakki] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Phys, TR-31034 Antakya, Turkey; [Yucel, Yasin] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Chem, TR-31034 Antakya, Turkey","Tozar, A (reprint author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Phys, TR-31034 Antakya, Turkey.",tozarali@gmail.com,,,Mustafa Kemal University Scientific Research Projects through the grant from Mustafa Kemal University Research Foundation [13920],Financial support for this research by the Mustafa Kemal University Scientific Research Projects through the grant from Mustafa Kemal University Research Foundation (Project No. 13920) is gratefully acknowledged.,,53,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1073-5623,1543-1940,,METALL MATER TRANS A,Metall.

FTIR and XRD plots show peaks corresponding to natural bone apatite which confirms the formation of HAp. TG analysis shows a maximum weight loss of 2.28% indicating high thermal stability of HAp beyond 800 degrees C. SEM micrographs illustrate highly porous morphology with interconnected pores. EDX analysis of the HAp exhibits close proximity of the calcium/phosphorous (Ca/P) ratio to natural bone apatite.

In this study, a combination of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs), cancellous bone graft (CBG), and chitosan hydrogel (CHI) was applied to the non-union bone fracture and healing effects were evaluated for the first time. After creation of animal models with non-union fracture in rats, they were randomly classified into seven groups. Radiography at 0, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery, indicated the positive effects of Ad-MSCs + CBG + CHI and Ad-MSCs + CBG in treatment of bone fractures as early as 2 weeks after the surgery. These data were confirmed with both biomechanical and histological studies. Gene expression analyses of Vegf and Bmp2 showed a positive effect of Ad-MSCs on vascularization and osteogenic differentiation in all groups receiving Ad-MSCs, as shown by real-time PCR. Immunofluorescence analysis and RT-PCR results indicated existence of human Ad-MSCs in the fractured region 8 weeks post-surgery. In conclusion, we suggest that application of Ad-MSCs, CBG, and CHI, could be a suitable combination for osteoinduction and osteoconduction to improve non-union bone fracture healing.

Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is an outstanding biomaterial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine; however, BNC's applications have been focused on two-dimensional (2D) medical devices, such as wound dressings. Given the need for three-dimensional (3D) porous biomaterials, this work evaluates two methods to generate (3D) BNC scaffolds. The structural characteristics and physicochemical, mechanical, and cell behaviour properties were evaluated. Likewise, the effects of the pore size and surface area in the mechanical performance of BNC biomaterials and their cell response in a fibroblast cell line are discussed for the first time. In this study, a new method is proposed for the development of 3D BNC scaffolds using paraffin wax. This new method is less time-consuming, more robust in removing the paraffin and less aggressive toward the BNC microstructure. Moreover, the biomaterial had regular porosity with good mechanical behaviour; the cells can adhere and increase in number without overcrowding.

Grafting of polyurethane on CD is confirmed through H-1 NMR and molecular weight measurement while FTIR and UV visible studies further support grafting and emphasize the interaction among polymer chains as a whole. Degree of grafting is evaluated from the integrated peak area in NMR spectra. Thermal and mechanical measurements show improved stability and strength of the graft polymers with respect to pure CD. The conversion of particle nature of CD to strip-like morphology in graft copolymers is evident from atomic force microscopy. Sustained drug release has been achieved using graft copolymer against burst release from pure CD and specific interactions, as observed through spectroscopy and thermal measurements, are responsible for sustained release of drug. Biocompatibility of graft copolymers has been checked using cellular studies through MTT assay and cell adhesion. Importantly, the cell killing efficiency has been demonstrated by embedding anticancer drug in polymer matrices causing mortality rate of 75% using graft copolymer against scanty 25% using pure drug or drug embedded in CD and the result is understood from the sustained release of drug from the graft copolymer vis-a-vis burst release in other systems.

Impressively, the obtained PVA/PAM/BNNS composite hydrogel possesses super-flexibility, high toughness, good thermal conductivity, appropriate tissue adhesiveness and stimuli-free self-healing ability.

Like many naturally-derived biomaterials, the intrinsic biological activity and biocompatibility of keratin render this polymer a potential candidate for applications in medicine, and for the fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering. While several sources of keratin can be considered, the bioactivity of the keratins obtained can be quite different. In this study we discuss the processing and characterization of keratin from camel hair and goat cashmere. Specifically, the camel hair and cashmere were dissolved in an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride), and the characteristics of the soluble and insoluble keratin were evaluated. The structure and properties of the raw material, soluble, and insoluble keratin were studied. Compared to the starting material, the soluble keratin showed chemical changes viz. decrease of cysteine, and minor structural changes. Preliminary in vitro biological properties performed by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and scratch test showed good bioactivity in keratin from both sources. In particular, cell migration was observed to be faster when cells were cultured in the presence of soluble keratin extracted from camel hair and cashmere.","[Yang, Y.

Comparing to traditional fabrication methods, the AM method offers advantages of accurate control of complex cell shapes and internal pore architectures, thus attracting extensive attention. Considering the long-term safety in the human body, the metallic cellular structures should possess high fatigue strength.

However, they often show insufficient compressive ductility or insufficient structural integrity. In this study, a batch of 45 octahedral Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures was manufactured in three different strut diameters (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mm) by selective electron beam melting (SEBM). The influence of post-SEBM annealing on the compressive deformation characteristics of the lattice structure was investigated. The as-built Ti-6Al-4V lattices fragmented when the compressive strain reached 13%-23% depending on strut diameter. Annealing at 950 degrees C (beta transus temperature: 995 degrees C) only slightly improved the compressive ductility of the lattice structures. However, annealing at 1050 degrees C (beta-annealing) fundamentally changed the compressive deformation mode of the lattice structures. The resultant compressive stress-strain curve was featured by a long smooth plateau and no facture occurred even after significant densification of the lattice structure had taken place (>50% of compressive strain).

However, its clinical applications are limited due to its biocompatibility and rapid corrosion. Since material corrosion and biocompatibility can be categorized under surface properties of biomaterials, this study employed a surface modification method to fabricate new alloys. Reinforcement of magnesium alloys with powders have engineered a new type of material regarded as metal matrix composites. Friction Stir processing method was used in this study to fabricate AZ31 magnesium alloy. The Mg alloys were reinforced with four different powders (i.e. Fly Ash, Palm Kernel Shell Ash, Ti-6Al-4V and 304 Stainless steel powders) to try to improve the acute corrosion resistance and also other mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile property and wear performance of the fabricated composites. The result shows that particle reinforcement of magnesium alloy has much influence on the corrosion rate and wear behavior when compared with the unreinforced AZ31 Magnesium alloy. 304 stainless steel serves as the best reinforcement among the reinforcements used in this study, offering the highest corrosion resistance of 0.2020 mm/year, good wear resistance and higher tensile strength of 454.18 MPa. Therefore, this study may offer insight on obtaining both corrosion resistance and biocompatibility at the same time on the magnesium alloy, which may extend their potential applications in biomaterials and biomedical devices.","[Adetunla, Adedotun; Akinlabi, Esther] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Mech Engn Sci, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa","Adetunla, A (reprint author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Mech Engn Sci, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",dotunadetunla@yahoo.com,,"Adetunla, Adedotun/0000-0001-7183-107X",University of Johannesburg,"The authors would like to acknowledge the University of Johannesburg under the GES award scholarship of Postgraduate Research Centre for their financial support and the mechanical laboratory of India Institute of Science, India for allowing us to use their facility to produce the composite samples.",,31,0,0,39,39,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2053-1591,,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

It introduces a broad overview of the different alloying elements, coating materials, and processing methods used to improve the corrosion behaviour, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility of iron implant materials for temporary hard tissue scaffolds. An emphasis is set on Mn and Zn as the most promising alloying elements for Fe as well as on innovative calcium phosphate-based ceramic and polymeric coatings. In addition, the novel iron-ceramic composite biomaterials for orthopaedic implants are mentioned. Finally, recent challenges and future development direction for iron-based materials are proposed.","[Gorejova, R.; Haverova, L.; Orinakova, R.; Orinak, A.] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Sci, Dept Phys Chem, Moyzesova 11, Kosice 04154, Slovakia; [Orinak, M.] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Arts, Dept British & Amer Studies, Moyzesova 9, Kosice 04001, Slovakia","Orinakova, R (reprint author), Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Sci, Dept Phys Chem, Moyzesova 11, Kosice 04154, Slovakia.",renata.orinakova@upjs.sk,,"Orinak, Andrej/0000-0001-6624-9907",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-16-0029]; Slovak Scientific Grant Agency [VEGA 1/0074/17],This work was supported by the Projects APVV-16-0029 of the Slovak Research and Development Agency and VEGA 1/0074/17 of the Slovak Scientific Grant Agency.,,123,0,0,77,77,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

The PEO treatment was performed using a pulsed DC power supply at 280 V for 3 min. The PEO-treated surface was observed with field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS; Oxford ISIS 310, England), Image Analyzer software, and X-ray diffractometer (TF-XRD, X'pert Philips, Netherlands). The number of pores increases, as the Zn ion content increases. And the number of pores decrease, as the Mn ion content increases. The addition of Zn and Mn ions affects the number and size of pores and the area occupied by the pores. Mn and Zn are distributed around pores and in the pores. Anatase and rutile peaks appear and the HA peak shifted to the left in the case of Mn and Zn ion additions.","[Choe, Han-Cheol] Chosun Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Dent Mat, Gwangju 61452, South Korea; Chosun Univ, Coll Dent, Res Ctr Nanointerface Activat Biomat, Gwangju 61452, South Korea","Choe, HC (reprint author), Chosun Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Dent Mat, Gwangju 61452, South Korea.",,,, [NRF: 2015H1C1A1035241];  [NRF: 17GJ1006],This work was supported by NRF: 2015H1C1A1035241 and NRF: 17GJ1006,,13,0,0,19,19,AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,VALENCIA,"26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA",1533-4880,1533-4899,,J NANOSCI NANOTECHNO,J.

Understanding the mechanism of biologically controlled or induced mineralization would be particularly useful in the development or optimization of biomaterials. The nucleation of minerals stays at the core position during mineralization. In this work, the molecular dynamics simulation approach was employed to tackle the nucleation process of hydroxyapatite in aqueous phase with the type I collagen as the seed. In our simulation, we can offer strong evidence to confirm the formation of Ca-P clusters on the collagen surface, and predominantly around the charged residues, especially when the Glu-Arg pair occurs in the same region. Before the nucleation on the collagen surface, small Ca-P clusters could be generated initially in the solution with characteristics of Ponser's cluster. Moreover, the surface free energy calculations could confirm that the energy would continuously decrease with increasing cluster size. Our simulation also indicates that different collagen properties could lead to different morphology of final amorphous calcium phosphate clusters.","[Xue, Zhiyu; Xu, Dingguo] Sichuan Univ, Coll Chem, MOE Key Lab Green Chem & Technol, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mingli; Xu, Dingguo] Sichuan Univ, Genome Res Ctr Biomat, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mingli] Sichuan Univ, Inst Atom & Mol Phys, MOE Key Lab High Energy Dens Phys & Technol, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Xu, DG (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Chem, MOE Key Lab Green Chem & Technol, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Xu, DG (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, Genome Res Ctr Biomat, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",dgxu@scu.edu.cn,,"Yang, Mingli/0000-0001-8590-8840",,,,80,0,0,0,0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1932-7447,,,J PHYS CHEM C,J.

Omega-3 fatty acids are precursors of pro-resolving mediators and support the resolution of inflammation. Objective The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with liver cirrhosis and ACLF. Methods Patients with liver cirrhosis with and without ACLF were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and analyzed post-hoc for the present sub-study. Clinical data and biomaterials were collected at baseline and at day 7, 28 and after 3 months of follow-up. Plasma concentrations of arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which represent key omega-6 and -3 fatty acids, respectively, were quantified and associated with markers of systemic inflammation and severity of liver cirrhosis. Results A total of 117 patients were included in the present analyses. Of those, 26 (22.2%), 51 (43.6%) and 40 (34.2%) patients had compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, and ACLF. Plasma levels of ARA and DHA were similar in patients with compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and ACLF. Furthermore, no significant association between plasma ARA or DHA and C-reactive protein or peripheral blood leukocytes were observed (P>0.05). Conclusion In our study plasma levels of key omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid are neither associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis nor with liver-cirrhosis-associated systemic inflammation.","[Schwarzkopf, Katharina Maria; Queck, Alexander; Cai, Chengcong; Freygang, Ylva; Rueschenbaum, Sabrina; Zeuzem, Stefan; Welsch, Christoph; Lange, Christian Markus] Goethe Univ Hosp Frankfurt, Dept Internal Med 1, Frankfurt, Germany; [Thomas, Dominique; Angioni, Carlo; Geisslinger, Gerd] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Clin Pharmacol, Frankfurt, Germany; [Geisslinger, Gerd] Fraunhofer Inst Mol Biol & Appl Ecol IME, Project Grp Translat Med & Pharmacol TMP, Frankfurt, Germany","Lange, CM (reprint author), Goethe Univ Hosp Frankfurt, Dept Internal Med 1, Frankfurt, Germany.",Christian.Lange@uk-essen.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [LA 2806/2-1, LA 2806/5-1]; LOEWE Center for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology","This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft http://www.dfg.de (LA 2806/2-1 and LA 2806/5-1 to CML) and by the LOEWE Center for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology (http://www.proloewe.de/en/loewe-research-initiatives/loewe-research-initiatives/pharmaceutical-research.html) TMP to DT, GG, SZ, CW and CML.

Biologic scaffolds (derived from decellularized tissue extracellular matrix) promote a wound-healing (proregenerative) immune phenotype and are used clinically to treat tissue loss, including in the context of tumor resection. It is unknown whether a biomaterial microenvironment that encourages tissue formation may also promote tumor development. We implanted a urinary bladder matrix (UBM) scaffold, which is used clinically for wound management, with syngeneic cancer cell lines in mice to study how wound-healing immune responses affect tumor formation and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. The UBM scaffold created an immune microenvironment that inhibited B16-F10 melanoma tumor formation in a CD4(+) T cell-dependent and macrophage-dependent manner. In-depth immune characterization revealed an activated type 2-like immune response that was distinct from the classical tumor microenvironment, including activated type 2 T helper T cells, a unique macrophage phenotype, eosinophil infiltration, angiogenic factors, and complement. Tumor growth inhibition by PD-1 and PD-L1 check-point blockade was potentiated in the UBM scaffold immune microenvironment. Engineering the local tumor microenvironment to promote a type 2 wound-healing immune signature may serve as a therapeutic target to improve immunotherapy efficacy.","[Wolf, Matthew T.; Wang, Tony L.; Narain, Radhika; Cherry, Christopher; Parrillo, Alexis J.; Elisseeff, Jennifer H.] Translat Tissue Engn Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Wolf, Matthew T.; Ganguly, Sudipto; Pan, Fan; Pardoll, Drew M.; Elisseeff, Jennifer H.] Bloomberg Kimmel Inst Canc Immunotherapy, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Wolf, Matthew T.; Elisseeff, Jennifer H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Ganguly, Sudipto; Wang, Guannan; Pan, Fan; Sukumar, Saraswati; Pardoll, Drew M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Ganguly, Sudipto; Wang, Guannan; Pan, Fan; Sukumar, Saraswati; Pardoll, Drew M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Wang, Tony L.; Narain, Radhika; Cherry, Christopher; Parrillo, Alexis J.; Elisseeff, Jennifer H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Anderson, Christopher W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Expt Pathol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Sadtler, Kaitlyn] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sadtler, Kaitlyn] Harvard Med Sch, Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Benjamin, V] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA","Elisseeff, JH (reprint author), Translat Tissue Engn Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA.; Elisseeff, JH (reprint author), Bloomberg Kimmel Inst Canc Immunotherapy, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.; Elisseeff, JH (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.; Elisseeff, JH (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jhe@jhu.edu,,"Ganguly, Sudipto/0000-0002-2662-8897","Bloombergsimilar toKimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy; ACell Inc.; Hartwell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship; Melanoma Research Alliance; U.S. Department of Defense [PC130767]; NIH [RO1AI099300, RO1AI089830]; Cancer Center Support Grant (NCI) [P30CA006973]; Department of Defense BCRP [W81XWH-15-1-0017]; John Fetting Fund for Breast Cancer Prevention Research","This work was supported by The Bloomberg similar to Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and ACell Inc.

Fibronectin is an ECM protein commonly used for biomaterial functionalization. The use of fibronectin recombinant fragments is an attractive alternate to the use of full-length fibronectin because of the relatively low cost and facility of purification. However, it is necessary to combine more than one fragment, for example, the cell attachment site and the heparin binding II (HBII), either mixed or in one molecule, to obtain complete activity. In the present study, we proposed to install adhesion capacity to the HBII fragment by an RGD gain-of-function DNA mutation, retaining its cell differentiation capacity and thereby producing a small and very active protein fragment. The novel molecule, covalently immobilized onto titanium surfaces, maintained the growth factor-binding capacity and stimulated cell spreading, osteoblastic cell differentiation, and mineralization of human mesenchymal stem cells compared to the HBII native protein. These results highlight the potential capacity of gain-of-function DNA mutations in the design of novel molecules for the improvement of osseointegration properties of metallic implant surfaces.","[Guillem-Marti, Jordi; Gelabert, Maria; Heras-Parets, Aina; Pegueroles, Marta; Ginebra, Maria-Pau; Maria Manero, Jose] UPC, Biomat Biomech & Tissue Engn Grp, Dept Mat Sci & Met Engn, Barcelona 08930, Spain; [Guillem-Marti, Jordi; Gelabert, Maria; Heras-Parets, Aina; Pegueroles, Marta; Ginebra, Maria-Pau; Maria Manero, Jose] UPC, Barcelona Res Ctr Multiscale Sci & Engn, Barcelona 08930, Spain; [Ginebra, Maria-Pau] BIST, Inst Bioengn Catalonia IBEC, Barcelona 08028, Spain","Guillem-Marti, J (reprint author), UPC, Biomat Biomech & Tissue Engn Grp, Dept Mat Sci & Met Engn, Barcelona 08930, Spain.; Guillem-Marti, J (reprint author), UPC, Barcelona Res Ctr Multiscale Sci & Engn, Barcelona 08930, Spain.",jordi.guillem.marti@upc.edu,"Guillem-Marti, Jordi/G-8411-2015","Guillem-Marti, Jordi/0000-0003-0307-2221; Ginebra, Maria-Pau/0000-0002-4700-5621; PEGUEROLES, MARTA/0000-0002-7895-8337",Spanish Government [MAT2015-67183-R]; EU through the European Regional Development Funds [PDJ2014]; PDJ2014 fellowship from the Agency for Management of University and Research Grants (AGAUR) - Generalitat de Catalunya; ICREA Academia award for excellence in research - Generalitat de Catalunya; Generalitat de Catalunya [2017SGR-1165],"The authors acknowledge the financial support received from the Spanish Government through the MAT2015-67183-R project, cofunded by the EU through the European Regional Development Funds.

FDA-approved external tissue sealants include the topical application of fibrin gels, which can be 500 times denser than natural fibrin clots. With lower clot porosity and higher polymerization rates than physiologically formed fibrin clots, the commercial gels quickly stop blood loss but impede the later clot degradation kinetics and thus retard tissue-healing rates. The fibrin nanoparticles (FBNs) described here are constructed from physiologically relevant fibrin concentrations that support new tissue and dermal wound scaffold formation when coupled with growth factors. The FBNs, synthesized in a microfluidic droplet generator, support cell adhesion and traction generation, and when coupled to keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), support cell migration and in vivo wound healing. The FBN-KGF particles enhance cell migration in vitro greater than FBN alone or free KGF and also improve healing outcomes in a murine full thickness injury model compared to saline, bulk fibrin sealant, free KGF, or bulk fibrin mixed with KGF treatments. Furthermore, FBN can be potentially administered with other tissue-healing factors and inflammatory mediators to improve wound-healing outcomes.","[Muhamed, Ismaeel; Sproul, Erin P.; Ligler, Frances S.; Brown, Ashley C.] North Carolina State Univ & Univ North Carolina C, Joint Dept Biomed Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Muhamed, Ismaeel; Sproul, Erin P.; Ligler, Frances S.; Brown, Ashley C.] North Carolina State Univ, Comparat Med Inst, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Brown, AC (reprint author), North Carolina State Univ & Univ North Carolina C, Joint Dept Biomed Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.; Brown, AC (reprint author), North Carolina State Univ, Comparat Med Inst, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",aecarso2@ncsu.edu,,,"Ross Lampe Chair in Biomedical Engineering, NC State University start-up funds; American Heart Association [16SDG29870005]","Funding was provided by the Ross Lampe Chair in Biomedical Engineering, NC State University start-up funds, and the American Heart Association 16SDG29870005.",,72,0,0,3,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

The obtained results show that the minimum requirement for the pore size is considered less than similar to 100 nm due to the cell size, migration requirements and transport of the alive cell. However, pore sizes higher than similar to 65-100 nm are supported in order to enhance the formation of the tissue in the biological environment such as simulated body fluid (SBF) and physiological saline (PS) as well as excellent capillaries formation. The resulting porosity is obtained without using porosity agents, and it is found that the holes are related to dimensions within the range of 60-82% and 55-75% for the samples soaked in the SBF and PS after 21 days, respectively. Also, it is revealed that the fracture toughness and compressive strength values of the samples are within the range of 0.66-0.89 MPa m(1/2) and 4.5-5.7 MPa, respectively. Additionally, based on the extracted mechanical properties of the bio-nanocomposite scaffold, the nonlinear resonance response of a beam-type bone implant under soft and hard excitations is predicted analytically corresponding to the both subharmonic and superharmonic ranges. The bio-nanocomposite scaffold containing 15 wt% TiO2 represents proper cell viability and cultured cell which prove the cytocompatibility of the fabricated NC-TiO2-NaCl scaffolds.

Despite the progress made over the last 2 decades to improve their clinical performance, symptoms of ocular dryness and discomfort and a variety of adverse clinical events are still reported. Consequently, the rate of CL wear discontinuation has not been appreciably diminished by their introduction. Aiming to improve the interfacial interactions of silicone hydrogel CLs with the ocular surface, a biomimetic layer of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA) (100 kDa) was covalently attached to the surface of model poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-3-methacryloxypropyltris-(trimethylsiloxy)silane) (pHEMA-co-TRIS) silicone hydrogel materials via UV-induced thiol-ene ""click"" chemistry. The surface structural changes after each modification step were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Successful grafting of a homogeneous HA layer to the surface of the model silicone hydrogels was confirmed by the consistent appearance of N (1s) and the significant decrease of the Si (2p) peaks, as determined by low-resolution angle-resolved XPS. The HA-grafted surfaces demonstrated reduced contact angles, dehydration rate, and nonspecific deposition of lysozyme and albumin, while maintaining their optical transparency (>90%). In vitro studies demonstrated that the HA-grafted pHEMA-co-TRIS materials did not show any toxicity to human corneal epithelial cells. These results suggest that surface immobilization of HA via thiol-ene ""click"" chemistry can be used as a promising surface treatment for silicone hydrogel CLs.","[Korogiannaki, Myrto; Sheardown, Heather] McMaster Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Jones, Lyndon] Univ Waterloo, Ctr Ocular Res & Educ, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Sheardown, H (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",sheardow@mcmaster.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; 20/20 NSERC Ophthalmic Materials Research Network,"This work was financially supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and the 20/20 NSERC Ophthalmic Materials Research Network and is gratefully acknowledged.

Recent studies show interesting dose-dependent effect of fluoride ions on the stem cells. Despite of interesting properties of fluoride ions as well as nanosilicate, there is no reported literature on the effect of fluoride-doped nanosilicates on stem cells. We have systematically evaluated the interaction of fluoride nanosilicate platelets (NS + F) with human dental follicle stem cells (hDFSCs) to probe the cytotoxicity, cellular transport (internalization) and osteogenic differentiation capabilities in comparison with already reported nanosilicate platelets without fluoride (NS - F). To understand the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of the nanosilicate system, nanosilicate treated hDFSCs are cultured in three different medium namely normal growth medium, osteoconductive medium, and osteoinductive medium up to 21d. NS + F treated stem cells show higher ALP activity, osteopontin levels and significant alizarin red staining compared to NS - F treated cells. This study highlights that the particles having fluoride additives (NS + F) aid in enhancing the osteogenic differentiation capabilities of hDFSCs thus potential nanobiomaterial for periodontal bone tissue regeneration.","[Veernala, Induvahi; Giri, Jyotsnendu; Polley, Poulomi; Singh, Ruby; Yadava, Sunil Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Biomed Engn, Kandi, Telangana, India; [Pradhan, Arpan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Giri, J (reprint author), Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Biomed Engn, Kandi, Telangana, India.",jgiri@iith.ac.in,,,"Indian Institute of technology, Hyderabad (MHRD); Nanomission project from Department of Science and Technology (DST), India [SR/NM/-NS-1364/2014(G)]; Department of Biotechnology (DBT), India [BT/RLF/Re-entry/21/2013]","This work was supported by Indian Institute of technology, Hyderabad (MHRD).

In nature, proteins can be driven into assemblies frequently by various non-covalent interactions. Assembly of proteins into supramolecules can be conducted under limited conditions in solution. These factors force the assembly process into an equilibrium state with low stability. Here, we report a new method for preparing assemblies using protein crystals as non-equilibrium molecular scaffolds. Protein crystals provide an ideal environment with a highly ordered packing of subunits in which the supramolecular assembled structures are formed in the crystalline matrix. Based on this feature, we demonstrate the self-assembly of supramolecular nanotubes constructed from protein crystals triggered by co-oxidation with cross-linkers. The assembly of tubes is driven by the formation of disulfide bonds to retain the intermolecular interactions within each assembly in the crystalline matrix after dissolution of the crystals.","[Nguyen, Tien Khanh; Negishi, Hashiru; Abe, Satoshi; Ueno, Takafumi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Midori Ku, Nagatsuta Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan","Ueno, T (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Midori Ku, Nagatsuta Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.",tueno@bio.titech.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [JP 18K19143, JP17H05358, 18H05421, JP16K17931, JP17H05872]","We acknowledge Prof. Fukui and Prof. Atomi (Kyoto University) for transfer of the plasmid of RubisCO and their advice on the preparation.

Here we report new photo-activatable cell-material interfacing systems that trigger cellular uptake of various cargoes and cell adhesion towards surfaces. To achieve this, we designed a novel photo-caged peptide which undergoes a structural transition from an antifouling ligand to a cell-penetrating peptide upon photo-irradiation. When the peptide is conjugated to ligands of interest, we demonstrate the photo-activated cellular uptake of a wide range of cargoes, including small fluorophores, proteins, inorganic (e.g., quantum dots and gold nanostars) and organic nanomaterials (e.g., polymeric particles), and liposomes. Using this system, we can remotely regulate drug administration into cancer cells by functionalizing camptothecin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles with our synthetic peptide ligands. Furthermore, we show light-controlled cell adhesion on a peptide-modified surface and 3D spatiotemporal control over cellular uptake of nanoparticles using two-photon excitation. We anticipate that the innovative approach proposed in this work will help to establish new stimuli-responsive delivery systems and biomaterials.","[Lin, Yiyang; Mazo, Manuel M.; Skaalure, Stacey C.; Thomas, Michael R.; Stevens, Molly M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, Dept Bioengn, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Lin, Yiyang; Mazo, Manuel M.; Skaalure, Stacey C.; Thomas, Michael R.; Stevens, Molly M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, Inst Biomed Engn, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Schultz, Simon R.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Schultz, Simon R.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Neurotechnol, London SW7 2AZ, England","Stevens, MM (reprint author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, Dept Bioengn, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.",m.stevens@imperial.ac.uk,,"Thomas, Michael/0000-0001-7795-9648; Lin, Yiyang/0000-0003-2017-190X","FP7 Marie Curie Action TIME TO MATURE [625472]; European Research Council H2020 through the Individual Marie Skodowska-Curie Fellowship ""RADoTE"" [701664]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) i-sense IRC in Early Warning Sensing Systems for Infectious Diseases [EP/K031953/1]; European Research Council (ERC) Seventh Framework Programme Consolidator grant ""Naturale CG"" [616417]; Wellcome Trust [098411/Z/12/Z]","M.M. was supported by the FP7 Marie Curie Action TIME TO MATURE (625472).

On the other hand, bioprinting technology is a novel therapeutic approach that aims to replace the diseased or lost beta-cells, insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas, which can potentially regenerate damaged organs such as the pancreas. Stem cells have the ability to differentiate into various cell lines including insulinproducing cells. However, there are still barriers that hamper the successful differentiation of stem cells into beta-cells. In this review, we focus on the potential applications of stem cell research and bioprinting that may be targeted towards replacing the beta-cells in the pancreas and may offer approaches towards treatment of diabetes. This review emphasizes on the applicability of employing both stem cells and other cells in 3D bioprinting to generate substitutes for diseased beta-cells and recover lost pancreatic functions.

The effects on light-induced cell detachment behaviors were also investigated and discussed. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Circular dichroism were used to characterize the surface morphology, crystalline phase, surface composition and adsorption conformation of protein molecules. It was found that a combined process of ultraviolet illumination followed by hydrothermal treatment not only promoted cells adhesion but also showed the highest efficiency in light induced cell detachment. The reason is ascribed to that such process promotes the formation of terminal hydroxyl groups in TiO2 surface, and subsequently affect the adsorption conformation of protein molecules. This study indicated that such treatment could effectively modulate the contents of surface hydroxyl groups in different states. That shows much potential in optimizing the biological performance of TiO2 based biomaterials.","[Hu, Huiwen; Wan, Hongping; Dong, Lingqing; Cheng, Kui; Weng, Wenjian] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Cyrus Tang Ctr Sensor Mat & Applicat, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jun; Wang, Huiming] Zhejiang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Med Coll, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Dong, Lingqing; Wang, Huiming] Zhejiang Univ, Affiliated Stomatol Hosp, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Al-Furjan, Mohannad Saleh Hammadi] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Cheng, K (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Cyrus Tang Ctr Sensor Mat & Applicat, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chengkui@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51872259, 51472216, 51772273]; 111 Project [B16042]","This work is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51872259, 51472216, 51772273) and the 111 Project under grant B16042.",,32,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0257-8972,,,SURF COAT TECH,Surf.

However, the waiting time for a donor cornea has gradually increased due to a decrease in supply caused by an aging population and increased cases of laser-based surgeries. Artificial corneas were developed to meet the increase in demand; however, these approaches have suffered from material deterioration resulted by the limited tissue integration. Here, we introduce a cornea-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (Co-dECM) as a bioink for corneal regeneration. The developed Co-dECM bioink had similar quantitative measurement results for collagen and GAGs compared with that of the native cornea and also had the proper transparency for vision. The differentiation potential of human turbinate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hTMSCs) to a keratocyte lineage was only observed in the Co-dECM group. Moreover, the developed bioink did not have any cytotoxic effect on encapsulated cells for three-dimensional (3D) culture and has great biocompatibility evident by the xeno-implantation of the Co-dECM gel into mice and rabbits for two and one month, respectively. An in vivo safety similar to clinical-grade collagen was seen with the Co-dECM, which helped to maintain the keratocyte-specific characteristics in vivo, compared with collagen. Taken together, the Co-dECM bioink has the potential to be used in various types of corneal diseases based on its corneal-specific ability and design flexibility through 3D cell printing technology.","[Kim, Hyeonji; Cho, Dong-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Kim, Hyeonji; Cho, Dong-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Rapid Prototyping Based 3D Tissue Organ Print, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Park, Moon-Nyeo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Korean Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jisoo; Jang, Jinah] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Interdisciplinary Biosci & Bioengn, Pohang, South Korea; [Jang, Jinah] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Creat IT Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Kim, Hong-Kyun] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Daegu, South Korea","Cho, DW (reprint author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.; Cho, DW (reprint author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Rapid Prototyping Based 3D Tissue Organ Print, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.",dwcho@postech.ac.kr,,,"Industrial Technology Innovation Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MI, Korea) [10048358]; MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), Korea, under the ""ICT Consilience Creative Program"" [IITP-R0346-16-1007]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Industrial Technology Innovation Program (Grant number 10048358), funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MI, Korea); and by the MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), Korea, under the ""ICT Consilience Creative Program"" (IITP-R0346-16-1007) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion).",,35,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2041-7314,,,J TISSUE ENG,J.

Here, we show that asymptomatic patients display mesh-associated inflammatory granulomas long after surgery, which are dominated by monocyte-derived macrophages expressing high levels of inflammatory activation markers. In mice, mesh implantation by the onlay technique induced rapid and strong myeloid cell accumulation, without substantial attenuation for up to 90 days. Myeloid cells segregated into distinct macrophage subsets with separate spatial distribution, activation profiles, and functional properties, showing a stable inflammatory phenotype in the tissue surrounding the biomaterial and a mixed, wound-healing phenotype in the surrounding stromal tissue. Protein mass spectrometry confirmed the inflammatory nature of the foreign body reaction, as characterized by cytokines, complement activation, and matrix-modulating factors. Moreover, immunoglobulin deposition increased over time around the implant, arguing for humoral immune responses in association with the cell-driven inflammation. Intravital multiphoton microscopy revealed a high motility and continuous recruitment of myeloid cells, which is partly dependent on the chemokine receptor CCR2. CCR2-dependent macrophages are particular drivers of fibroblast proliferation. Thus, our work functionally characterizes myeloid cell-dependent inflammation following mesh implantation, thereby providing insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of foreign body reactions to implanted biomaterials.","[Heymann, Felix; Geiger, Melanie; Geisler, Lukas Jonathan; Frank, Lanna Katharina; Luedde, Tom; Trautwein, Christian; Tacke, Frank] Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Med 3, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [von Trotha, Klaus-Thilo; Lynen-Jansen, Petra; Roeth, Anjali A.; Conze, Joachim; Binneboesel, Marcel; Neumann, Ulf P.] Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplantat Surg, Aachen, Germany; [von Trotha, Klaus-Thilo] Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Vasc Surg, Aachen, Germany; [Preisinger, Christian] Univ Hosp Aachen, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res, Prote Core Facil, Aachen, Germany; [Lynen-Jansen, Petra] German Assoc Gastroenterol, Berlin, Germany; [Conze, Joachim; Neumann, Ulf P.] Hernienzentrum Dr Conze, Munich, Germany; [Binneboesel, Marcel] Univ Med Ctr Maastricht, Dept Surg, Maastricht, Netherlands","Tacke, F (reprint author), Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Med 3, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",frank.tacke@ginx.net,,,"German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ta434/3-1, SFB/TRR57]; IZKF Aachen","We thank the Two-Photon Microscopy and the Proteomics Core Facilities of the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF) Aachen.

In this study, the controlled surface micro/nanometer structure of bioactive scaffolds in a combination of biomaterial chemistry is harnessed to address this issue. Model bioactive biomaterials, bredigite (BRT) scaffolds, with controlled surface micro/nanostructure are successfully fabricated by combining 3D printing with a hydrothermal process. It is found that the growth of micro/nano-calcium phosphate crystals on the surface of BRT scaffolds notably enhances their compressive strength by healing the microcracks on the strut surface. The micro/nanostructured surface distinctly facilitates the spread and differentiation of chondrocytes by activating integrin alpha vb1 and alpha 5b1 heterodimers, regulates cell morphology, and promotes osteogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) through the synergetic effect of integrin alpha 5b1 and RhoA, in which the microrod surface demonstrates the highest stimulatory effect on the differentiation of chondrocytes and rBMSCs. The in vivo study shows that the micro/nanostructured surface of the 3D printed scaffolds obviously promotes the regeneration of both cartilage and subchondral bone tissues. This study suggests that the construction of controlled micro/nanostructured surface in porous 3D scaffolds offers a smart strategy to induce bilineage bioactivities for osteochondral regeneration.","[Deng, Cuijun; Zhang, Meng; Qin, Chen; Chang, Jiang; Wu, Chengtie] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Ceram, State Key Lab High Performance Ceram & Superfine, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China; [Deng, Cuijun; Zhang, Meng; Qin, Chen] Chinese Acad Sci Univ, Grad Sch, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Lin, Rongcai; Yao, Qingqiang; Wang, Liming] Nanjing Med Univ, Nanjing Hosp 1, Inst Digital Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 68th Changle Rd, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Wu, CT (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Ceram, State Key Lab High Performance Ceram & Superfine, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China.; Yao, QQ (reprint author), Nanjing Med Univ, Nanjing Hosp 1, Inst Digital Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 68th Changle Rd, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yaoqingqiang@126.com; chengtiewu@mail.sic.ac.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1105201]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [5171101275, 81771985, 81601612]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences CAS [QYZDB-SSW-SYS027]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [17441903700]; Key Research Program of Science & Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province [BE2016763]","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1105201), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (5171101275, 81771985, and 81601612), Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences CAS (QYZDB-SSW-SYS027), Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (17441903700), and Key Research Program of Science & Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province (BE2016763).",,68,0,0,18,18,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1616-301X,1616-3028,,ADV FUNCT MATER,Adv.

However, behaviors of upper critical solution temperature (UCST) have been less investigated so far, despite the importance of UCST. Here, we examined two citrulline-based polypeptides, poly(D-ornithine-co-D-citrulline) (PDOC) and poly(DL-ornithine-co-DL-citrulline) (PDLOC), to investigate how stereoregularity of the polypeptides influences UCST behavior, in addition to poly(L-ornithine-co-L-citrulline) (FLOC) previously studied. showed phase separation temperatures (T(p)s) higher than that of racemic PDLOC. Moreover, PDLOC underwent liquid to coacervate phase separation at T-p, whereas PLOC and PDOC underwent liquid to solid-like aggregation transitions. From a structural point of view, circular dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements revealed that homochiral PLOC and PDOC polypeptides formed alpha-helical structures and assembled into a regular hexagonal lattice upon phase separation. Interactions between the pendent ureido groups of homochiral POCs appear to play pivotal roles in helical folding and assembly into the hexagonal structure. In addition, T-p change in response to biodegradation was confirmed for both PLOC and PDLOC. The biodegradability was considerably influenced by phase-separated structures. These findings of UCST-type POCs in this study would provide important insights into structure-controllable and thermoresponsive biomaterials.

This material-based technology triggers spontaneous fibronectin organization and stimulates growth factor signalling, enabling synergistic integrin and BMP-2 receptor activation in mesenchymal stem cells. To translate this technology, plasma-polymerized PEA is used on 2D and 3D substrates to enhance cell signalling in vitro, showing the complete healing of a critical-sized bone injury in mice in vivo.

The PVA/KG cryogel is prepared by intermolecular cross-linking of PVA via freeze-thawing and Ca2+-mediated ionic gelation of KG to form stable salt bridges. The incorporation of polyP as amorphous nanoparticles with Ca2+ ions (Ca-polyP-NP) is achieved using an in situ approach. The polyP constituent does not significantly affect the viscoelastic properties of the PVA/KG cryogel that are comparable to natural soft tissue. The exposure of the Ca-polyP-NP within the cryogel to medium/serum allows the formation of a biologically active polyP coacervate/protein matrix that stimulates the growth of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and provides the cells a suitable matrix for infiltration superior to the polyP-free cryogel. In vivo biocompatibility studies in rats reveal that already two to four weeks after implantation into muscle, the implant regions containing the polyP-KG/PVA material become replaced by initial granulation tissue, whereas the controls are free of any cells. It is proposed that the polyP-KG/PVA cryogel has the potential to become a promising implant material for soft tissue engineering/repair.","[Tolba, Emad; Wang, Xiaohong; Neufurth, Meik; Schroeder, Heinz C.; Mueller, Werner E.

Thanks to recent interdisciplinary studies, the materials developed have been intensively evaluated at animal level. Despite these efforts, less attention has been paid to what is really going on at the subcellular level during the interaction between a nanomaterial and a cell. As the proposed concept becomes more complex, the need for investigation of the dynamics of these materials at the cellular level becomes more prominent. For a deeper understanding of cellular events, fluorescent imaging techniques have been a powerful means whereby spatiotemporal information related to cellular events can be visualized as detectable fluorescent signals. To date, several excellent review papers have summarized the use of fluorescent imaging toolsets in cellular biology. However, applying these toolsets becomes a laborious process for those who are not familiar with imaging studies to engage with owing to the skills gap between them and cell biologists. This review aims to highlight the valuable essentials of fluorescent imaging as a tool for the development of effective biomaterials by introducing some cases including photothermal and photodynamic therapies. This distilled information will be a convenient short-cut for those who are keen to fabricate next generation biomaterials.","[Ferdinandus] Waseda Biosci Res Inst Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Arai, Satoshi] Waseda Univ, Res Inst Sci & Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Arai, Satoshi] PRIME AMED, Tokyo, Japan","Arai, S (reprint author), Waseda Univ, Res Inst Sci & Engn, Tokyo, Japan.; Arai, S (reprint author), PRIME AMED, Tokyo, Japan.",satoshiarai@aoni.waseda.jp,,,"Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) PRIME [JP18gm5810001, 18H04566, 16H06044]","This work was partially supported by Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) PRIME (JP18gm5810001), a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Chemistry for Multimolecular Crowding Biosystems (18H04566) and a Grand-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) (16H06044).",,63,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-4185,,,FRONT BIOENG BIOTECH,Front.

Various organic materials can be coated on substrates to assist cells' adhesion and other subsequent cellular processes. However, these coatings are expensive, degrade over short time period, and may even interfere with the cells' signaling processes. Therefore, the use of inorganic surfaces in order to control cellular interactions is of scientific importance from fundamental and application perspectives. Among inorganic materials, oxide thin films have received considerable attention. Thin films of oxides have the advantage of tailoring the surfaces for cellular interactions while using a negligible amount of the oxide material. Here, we review the lesser known application of inorganic oxide coatings as biocompatible and implantable platforms for different purposes, such as biofilm inhibition, cell culture and implant enhancements.","[Khokhlova, M.; Prellier, W.] Normandie Univ, ENSICAEN, CNRS UMR 6508, Lab CRISMAT, 6 Bd Marechal Juin, F-14050 Caen 4, France; [Dykas, M.; Krishnan-Kutty, V.; Patra, A.; Venkatesan, T.] Natl Univ Singapore, Nanosci & Nanotechnol Inst, NanoCore, 5A Engn Dr 1, Singapore 117411, Singapore","Prellier, W (reprint author), Normandie Univ, ENSICAEN, CNRS UMR 6508, Lab CRISMAT, 6 Bd Marechal Juin, F-14050 Caen 4, France.",wilfrid.prellier@ensicaen.fr,,,Normandie Universite; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); ODPRT grant from NUS; MERLION; Region Normandie,"M K received her PhD scholarship from the Normandie Universite.

Thus, GAG derivatives exhibit great relevance in the development of innovative biomaterials for tissue regeneration therapies. We present a synthetic strategy for the preparation of libraries of defined sulfated oligohyaluronans as model GAG systematically varied in length, sulfation pattern and anomeric substitution in order to elucidate the effects of these parameters on GAG recognition by regulatory proteins. Through an experimental and computational approach using fluorescence polarization, ITC, docking and molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the binding of these functionalized GAG derivatives to ten representative regulatory proteins including IL-8, IL-10, BMP-2, sclerostin, TIMP-3, CXCL-12, TGF-beta, FGF-1, FGF-2, and AT-III, and we establish structure-activity relationships for GAG recognition. Binding is mainly driven by enthalpy with only minor entropic contributions. In several cases binding is determined by GAG length, and in all cases by the position and number of sulfates. Affinities strongly depend on the anomeric modification of the GAG. Highest binding affinities are effected by anomeric functionalization with large fluorophores and by GAG dimerization. Our experimental and theoretical results suggest that the diversity of GAG binding sites and modes is responsible for the observed high affinities and other binding features. The presented new insights into GAG-protein recognition will be of relevance to guide the design of GAG derivatives with customized functions for the engineering of new biomaterials.","[Kohling, Sebastian; Blaszkiewicz, Joanna; Fernandez-Bachiller, Maria Isabel; Rademann, Joerg] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Pharm Med Chem, Konigin Luise Str 2 4, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Ruiz-Gomez, Gloria; Pisabarro, M.

An effective way to elicit a desired biological response is to employ micro/nanostructured constructions for biomaterial surface design; however, the brittleness of inorganic materials usually hinders structure regulation. In this study, a micro/nanostructured surface was fabricated using a hydrothermal treatment that did not require crystal regulation reagents. The precursor, beta-tricalcium phosphate, was mixed with CaSiO3. The resulting micro/nanostructured surface had a hybrid structure containing nanowires, microrods, and rod clusters. In vitro cellular proliferation, cytotoxicity and osteodifferentiation experiments indicated that the micro/nanostructured surfaces alleviated material cytotoxicity, improved cell proliferation, and effectively promoted osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells.

Lignin removal is a key step in paper production and biomass conversion to biofuels, motivating efforts to re-engineer lignin biosynthesis. However, the physical nature of lignin's interactions with wall polysaccharides is not well understood. Here we show that lignin self-aggregates to form highly hydrophobic and dynamically unique nanodomains, with extensive surface contacts to xylan. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of intact maize stems, supported by dynamic nuclear polarization, reveals that lignin has abundant electrostatic interactions with the polar motifs of xylan. Lignin preferentially binds xylans with 3-fold or distorted 2-fold helical screw conformations, indicative of xylans not closely associated with cellulose. These findings advance our knowledge of the molecular-level organization of lignocellulosic biomass, providing the structural foundation for optimization of post-harvest processing for biofuels and biomaterials.","[Kang, Xue; Kirui, Alex; Widanage, Malitha C.

Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and force spectroscopy were exploited to reveal the topographic and mechanical characteristics of charcoal-purified, solvent-cast polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) film. The root mean square surface roughness of a PHO surface derived from ethyl acetate, acetone, or chloroform solution was 13.2, 11.5, or 30.9 nm, respectively, for 100 mu m(2) AFM images. The distribution of the local Young's modulus had a maximum of 25.4, 14.1, and 12.6 MPa for PHO films obtained from ethyl acetate, acetone, and chloroform solution, respectively. The positron annihilation spectroscopy measurements allowed us to determine the free volume in the polymer film structure (9.38%).

Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) stimulate osteogenesis but their efficacy is impeded by their short half-life. Delivery by genetically modified cells can overcome this problem. However, cell isolation and propagation represent significant obstacles for the translation into the clinic. Instead, complete gene activated fragments of adipose tissue hold great potential for bone repair. Here, using an in-vitro culture system, we investigated whether adenoviral transduction with human BMP-2 can promote osteogenic differentiation within adipose tissue fragments. Osteoinduction in adipose tissue fragments was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistology and histomorphometry. BMP-2 transduced adipose tissue synthesized BMP-2 protein over 30 days peaking by day six, which significantly promoted osteogenic differentiation as indicated by increased calcium depositions, up-regulation of bone marker genes, and bone-related protein expression. Our results demonstrate that cells within adipose tissue fragments can differentiate osteogenically after BMP-2 transduction of cells on the surface of the adipose tissue. BMP-2 gene activated adipose tissue represents an advanced osteo-regenerative biomaterial that can actively contribute to osteogenesis and potentially enable the development of a novel, cost-effective, one-step surgical approach to bone repair without the need for cell isolation.","[Ren, Bin; Betz, Volker M.; Klar, Roland M.; Jansson, Volkmar; Mueller, Peter E.; Betz, Oliver B.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Univ Hosp Grosshadern, Dept Orthoped Surg Phys Med & Rehabil, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Thirion, Christian; Salomon, Michael] Sirion Biotech GmbH, Klopferspitz 19, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Ren, B (reprint author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Univ Hosp Grosshadern, Dept Orthoped Surg Phys Med & Rehabil, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",Bin.Ren@yahoo.com,,,Friedrich-Baur-Foundation (LITE:P); China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201406270144],This work was supported and funded by the Friedrich-Baur-Foundation (LITE:P).

Amphiphilic polymers are more attractive compared to their small molecule analogues because they exhibit significantly lower critical aggregation concentration, relatively larger particle size (suitable for the enhanced permeation and retention effect), and a much slower dynamics of exchange between the unimer and the aggregate. Representative examples of exchange dynamics in amphiphilic polymer aggregates and their noncovalent encapsulation stability as a function of the structure of the macromolecule, cross-linking, environmental parameters, and biological conditions, as probed by FRET studies, have been included in this article. Further, related observations on the utility of FRET in studying the exchange dynamics in supramolecular polymers, particularly in aqueous medium, have been discussed at length, revealing a strong impact of chirality, side chain polarity, and other parameters. Overall, this Review Article brings out the strength of this technique to probe dynamics of aggregates and assembled systems, mostly in water medium, which has a paramount importance in designing future biomaterials.","[Rajdev, Priya; Ghosh, Suhrit] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Tech Res Ctr, 2A & 2B Raja SC Mullick Rd, Kolkata 700032, India; [Ghosh, Suhrit] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Sch Appl & Interdisciplinary Sci, 2A & 2B Raja SC Mullick Rd, Kolkata 700032, India","Rajdev, P; Ghosh, S (reprint author), Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Tech Res Ctr, 2A & 2B Raja SC Mullick Rd, Kolkata 700032, India.; Ghosh, S (reprint author), Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Sch Appl & Interdisciplinary Sci, 2A & 2B Raja SC Mullick Rd, Kolkata 700032, India.",psupr2@iacs.res.in; psusg2@iacs.res.in,,,"DST, India [SR/WOS-A/CS-97/2011, DST/SJF/CSA-01/2-14-15]; Technical Research Centre for Molecules and Materials (DST), IACS","S.G. thanks the DST, India, for funding through the SwarnaJayanti Fellowship (DST/SJF/CSA-01/2-14-15).

Even though this polymerization technique appears straight forward, it holds pitfalls in terms of reproducibility and overall control over the polymerization conditions, which depends, beside choice of solvent or initiator, significantly on reagent purity. In addition, the synthesis of monomers can lead to the formation of racemic amino acids. Thus, in this work, we describe the benefits of highly pure monomers in order to control nucleophilic ring-opening polymerization NCAs. Hereby, monomer purity is investigated by relating melting points of NCAs with single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction crystallography data, which further proves retained stereo-information of NCAs.

In the hereby exploited reactive micro-contact printing (reactive-mu-CP) process, the surface of a micro-relief patterned PDMS-stamp is first functionalized with an amino-silane self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which is then inked with Au NPs. The stamp is subsequently brought into conformal contact with thiol-functionalized PEG-based hydrogel films. Due to the strong gold-thiol interactions the Au NPs are adequately and easily transferred onto the surfaces of these soft, multifunctional PEG hydrogels. In this way, defined mu-patterns of Au NPs on PEG hydrogels are achieved. These Au NPs patterns allow specific biomolecular interactions on PEG surfaces, and cell adhesion has been studied. Cells were found to effectively adhere only on Au NPs micro-patterns and to avoid the anti-adhesive PEG background. Besides the cell adhesion studies, these Au NPs mu-patterns can be potentially applied as biosensors in plasmon-based spectroscopic devices or in medicine, e.g., for drug delivery systems or photothermal therapies.","[Yesildag, Cigdem; Ouyang, Zhaofei; Zhang, Zhenfang; Lensen, Marga C.] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Chem, Nanopatterned Biomat, Berlin, Germany","Zhang, ZF; Lensen, MC (reprint author), Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Chem, Nanopatterned Biomat, Berlin, Germany.",lawrencezzf@hotmail.com; lensen@chem.tu-berlin.de,,,,,,43,0,0,3,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-2646,,,FRONT CHEM,Front.

The intramyocardial injection of biomaterials has been investigated as a potential treatment for heart failure by providing mechanical support to the myocardium and reducing stress on cardiomyocytes. Another treatment approach that has been explored is therapeutic angiogenesis that requires careful spatiotemporal control of angiogenic drug delivery. An injectable sulfonated reversible thermal gel composed of a polyurea conjugated with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and sulfonate groups has been developed for intramyocardial injection with angiogenic factors for the protection of cardiac function after a myocardial infarction.ResultsThe thermal gel allowed for the sustained, localized release of VEGF in vivo with intramyocardial injection after two weeks. A myocardial infarction reperfusion injury model was used to evaluate therapeutic benefits to cardiac function and vascularization. Echocardiography presented improved cardiac function, infarct size and ventricular wall thinning were reduced, and immunohistochemistry showed improved vascularization with thermal gel injections. The thermal gel alone showed cardioprotective and vascularization properties, and slightly improved further with the additional delivery of VEGF. An inflammatory response evaluation demonstrated the infiltration of macrophages due to the myocardial infarction was more significant compared to the foreign body inflammatory response to the thermal gel. Detecting DNA fragments of apoptotic cells also demonstrated potential anti-apoptotic effects of the thermal gel.ConclusionThe intramyocardial injection of the sulfonated reversible thermal gel has cardioprotective and vascularization properties for the treatment of myocardial infarction.","[Lee, David J.; Rocker, Adam J.; Soranno, Danielle E.; Shandas, Robin; Park, Daewon] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Bioengn, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Cavasin, Maria A.] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Soranno, Danielle E.] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Pediat, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Meng, Xianzhong] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Surg, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA","Park, D (reprint author), Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Bioengn, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",daewon.park@ucdenver.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [T32 HL072738, S10 OD018156, R21 HL124100]; American Heart Association [17GRNT33661024]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health R21 HL124100, National Institutes of Health T32 HL072738, National Institutes of Health S10 OD018156, and American Heart Association 17GRNT33661024.",,37,0,0,2,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1754-1611,,,J BIOL ENG,J.

Although chemotherapy is one of the most important strategies in glioma treatment, it remains extremely clinically challenging largely due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). Thus, the development of nanoparticles with both BBB and BBTB penetrability, as well as glioma-targeting feature, is extremely important for the therapy of glioma. New findings in nanomedicine are promoting the development of novel biomaterials. Herein, we designed a red blood cell membrane-coated solid lipid nanoparticle (RBCSLN)-based nanocarrier dual-modified with T7 and NGR peptide (T7/NGR-RBCSLNs) to accomplish these objectives. As a new kind of biomimetic nanovessels, RBCSLNs preserve the complex biological membranes while possessing physicochemical properties that are needed for efficient drug delivery. T7 is a ligand of transferrin receptors with seven peptides that is able to circumvent the BBB and target to glioma. NGR is a peptide ligand of CD13 that is overexpressed during angiogenesis, representing an excellent glioma-homing property. After encapsulating vinca alkaloid vincristine as the model drug, T7/NGR-RBCSLNs exhibited the most favorable antiglioma effects in vitro and in vivo by combining the dual-targeting delivery effect. The results demonstrate that dual-modified biomimetic nanoparticles provide a potential method to improve drug delivery to the brain, hence increasing glioma therapy efficacy.","[Fu, Shiyao; Liang, Meng; Wang, Yuli; Cui, Lin; Gao, Chunhong; Liu, Qianqian; Feng, Ye; Gong, Wei; Yang, Meiyan; Li, Zhiping; Yang, Yang; Gao, Chunsheng] Beijing Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, State Key Lab Toxicol & Med Countermeasures, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xiangyang] PLA, Gen Hosp Cent Theater, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fu, Shiyao; Cui, Lin; Yang, Chunrong] Jiamusi Univ, Jiamusi 154002, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xiaoyang] PLA, Hosp 307, Beijing 100071, Peoples R China","Yang, Y; Gao, CS (reprint author), Beijing Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, State Key Lab Toxicol & Med Countermeasures, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China.; Xie, XY (reprint author), PLA, Gen Hosp Cent Theater, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xxy5727035@163.com; amms2013@126.com; 135110279112@163.com,,,"Beijing Science and Technology New Star [Z161100004916162]; Beijing NSF [7172162]; National Science and Technology Major Projects for ""Major New Drugs Innovation and Development"" [2018ZX09711003-008-001]; NSF [81874305]; Health & Family Planning Commission of Hubei Province [WJ2017Q031]; Young & Middle-aged Medical Key Talents Training Project of Wuhan [2018-6]","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the Beijing Science and Technology New Star (Grant no.

In this study, a series of fluorinated polymeric gene carriers were synthesized via Michael addition from low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) and fluorobenzoic acids (FBAs)-based linking compounds with different numbers of fluorine atoms. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these materials was systematically investigated. SAR studies showed that fluorine could screen the positive charge of these polymers. However, this shielding effect of fluorine would endow fluorinated polymers with good balance between DNA condensation and release. In vitro transfection results suggested that these fluorinated polymers could mediate efficient gene delivery. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies demonstrated that more efficient cell uptake could be achieved by fluorinated materials with more fluorine atoms. Cytotoxicity assays showed that these fluorinated materials exhibited very low cytotoxicity even at high mass ratios.

Various descriptions of the ultrastructural arrangement to various implant design features, ranging from solid and macroporous geometries to surface modifications on the micron-, submicron-, and nano- levels, have been put forward. Here, the current knowledge regarding structural organisation of the bone-implant interface is reviewed with a focus on solid devices, mainly metal (or alloy) intended for permanent anchorage in bone. Certain biomaterials that undergo surface and bulk degradation are also considered. The bone-implant interface is a heterogeneous zone consisting of mineralised, partially mineralised, and unmineralised areas. Within the meso-micro-nano-continuum, mineralised collagen fibrils form the structural basis of the bone-implant interface, in addition to accumulation of non-collagenous macromolecules such as osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. In the published literature, as many as eight distinct arrangements of the bone-implant interface ultrastructure have been described. The interpretation is influenced by the in vivo model and species-specific characteristics, healing time point(s), physico-chemical properties of the implant surface, implant geometry, sample preparation route(s) and associated artefacts, analytical technique(s) and their limitations, and non-compromised vs compromised local tissue conditions. The understanding of the ultrastructure of the interface under experimental conditions is rapidly evolving due to the introduction of novel techniques for sample preparation and analysis. Nevertheless, the current understanding of the interface zone in humans in relation to clinical implant performance is still hampered by the shortcomings of clinical methods for resolving the finer details of the bone-implant interface. Statement of Significance Being a hierarchical material by design, the overall strength of bone is governed by composition and structure. Understanding the structure of the bone-implant interface is essential in the development of novel bone repair materials and strategies, and their long-term success. Here, the current knowledge regarding the eventual structural organisation of the bone-implant interface is reviewed, with a focus on solid devices intended for permanent anchorage in bone, and certain biomaterials that undergo surface and bulk degradation.

However, existing biomaterials often do not meet the clinical requirements of structural support, osteoinductive property, and controllable biodegradability. To treat large-scale bone defects, the development of three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds has received considerable focus within bone engineering. A variety of biomaterials and manufacturing methods, including 3D printing, have emerged to fabricate patient-specific bioactive scaffolds that possess controlled micro-architectures for bridging bone defects in complex configurations. During the last decade, with the development of the 3D printing industry, a large number of tissue-engineered scaffolds have been created for preclinical and clinical applications using novel materials and innovative technologies. Thus, this review provides a brief overview of current progress in existing biomaterials and tissue engineering scaffolds prepared by 3D printing technologies, with an emphasis on the material selection, scaffold design optimization, and their preclinical and clinical applications in the repair of critical-sized bone defects. Furthermore, it will elaborate on the current limitations and potential future prospects of 3D printing technology. Statement of Significance 3D printing has emerged as a critical fabrication process for bone engineering due to its ability to control bulk geometry and internal structure of tissue scaffolds. The advancement of bioprinting methods and compatible ink materials for bone engineering have been a major focus to develop optimal 3D scaffolds for bone defect repair. Achieving a successful balance of cellular function, cellular viability, and mechanical integrity under load-bearing conditions is critical. Hybridization of natural and synthetic polymerbased materials is a promising approach to create novel tissue engineered scaffolds that combines the advantages of both materials and meets various requirements, including biological activity, mechanical strength, easy fabrication and controllable degradation. 3D printing is linked to the future of bone grafts to create on-demand patient-specific scaffolds.

While the control of mechanical properties and network structures are important in all of these applications, for regenerative medicine applications in particular, matching the chemical, topographical and mechanical properties for the target use/tissue is critical. There have been multiple alternatives developed for fabricating materials with microstructures with goals of controlling the spatial location, phenotypic evolution, and signaling of cells. The commonly employed polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), polypeptides, and polysaccharides (as well as others) can be processed by various methods in order to control material heterogeneity and microscale structures. We review here the more commonly used polymers, chemistries, and methods for generating microstructures in biomaterials, highlighting the range of possible morphologies that can be produced, and the limitations of each method. With a focus in liquid-liquid phase separation, methods and chemistries well suited for stabilizing the interface and arresting the phase separation are covered. As the microstructures can affect cell behavior, examples of such effects are reviewed as well. Statement of Significance Heterogeneous hydrogels with enhanced matrix complexity have been studied for a variety of biomimetic materials. A range of materials based on poly(ethylene glycol), polypeptides, proteins, and/or polysaccharides, have been employed in the studies of materials that by virtue of their microstructure, can control the behaviors of cells. Methods including microfluidics, photolithography, gelation in the presence of porogens, and liquid-liquid phase separation, are presented as possible strategies for producing materials, and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed. We also describe in more detail the various processes involved in LLPS, and how they can be manipulated to alter the kinetics of phase separation and to yield different microstructured materials.

This phenomenon can be attributed to almost arbitrary biomaterial modification opportunities created by a multitude of polymers used to form nanofibers, as well as by surface functionalization methods. Among these applications, the hemostatic activity of nanofibrous materials is gaining more and more interest in biomedical research. It is therefore crucial to find both materials and nanofiber structural properties that affect organism responses. The present review critically analyzes the response of blood elements to natural and synthetic polymers, and their blends and composites. Also assessed in this review is the incorporation of pro-coagulative substances or drugs that can decrease bleeding time. The review also discusses the main animal models that were used to assess hemostatic agent safety and effectiveness. Statement of Significance The paper contains an in-depth review of the most representative studies recently published in the topic of nanofibrous hemostatic agents. The topic evolved from analysis of pristine polymeric nanofibers to multifunctional biomaterials. Furthermore, this study is important because it helps clarify the use of specific blood-biomaterial analysis techniques with emphasis on protein adsorption, thrombogenicity and blood coagulation. The paper should be of interest to the readers of Acta biomaterialia who are curious about the strategies and materials used for the development of multifunctional polymer nanofibers for novel blood contacting applications.

The fabrication of submicron textures on the polymer surface was followed by solvent impregnation with the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). An in vitro plasma coagulation assay showed that the biomimetic surface significantly increased the plasma coagulation time and also exhibited reduced platelet adhesion and activation, thereby reducing the risk of blood coagulation and thrombosis. A contact activation assay for coagulation factor XII (FXII) demonstrated that both NO release and surface texturing also reduced FXII contact activation, which contributes to the inhibition of plasma coagulation. The biomimetic surface was also evaluated for bacterial adhesion in plasma and results demonstrate that this combined strategy enables a synergistic effect to reduce bacterial adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa microorganisms. The results strongly suggest that the biomimetic modification with surface texturing and NO release provides an effective approach to improve the biocompatibility of polymeric materials in combating thrombosis and microbial infection. Statement of significance (1) Developed a dual functional polyurethane (PU) film that mimics blood vessel inner surface by combining surface texturing and nitric oxide (NO) release for combatting biomaterial associated thrombosis and microbial infection. (2) Studied the blood coagulation response and bacterial adhesion to such biomimetic PU surfaces, and demonstrated that the combination of surface texturing and NO release synergistically reduced the platelet adhesion and bacterial adhesion in plasma, providing an effective approach to improve the biocompatibility of biomaterials used in blood-contacting medical devices.

L-Arginine (Arg) is the common substrate for NOS and arginase. Both two metabolic pathways participate in the wound healing process. An impaired wound healing, such as diabetic or other chronic wounds is usually associated with an overproduction of NO by macrophages via the NOS pathway. In this study, a new family of L-nitroarginine (NOArg) based polyester amide (NOArg-PEA) and NOArg-Arg PEA copolymers (co-PEA) were designed and synthesized with different composition ratios. The NOArg-PEA and NOArg-Arg co-PEAs are biodegradable (more than 50% degradation in vitro in 4 days at 37 degrees C), biocompatible and did not activate the resting macrophage immune response per se. When classically activated or alternatively activated macrophages (CAM/AAM) were incubated with NOArg-PEA and NOArg-Arg co-PEAs, the treatments decreased the NO production of CAM, increased the arginase activity in both CAM and AAM, increased TGF-beta 1 production of CAM to various degrees and had no significant effect on TNF-alpha production. Diabetic rat models were used to evaluate the efficacy of NOArg-PEA and NOArg-Arg co-PEAs on wound healing. Diabetic rats treated with 2-NOArg-4 PEA, 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 20/80, and 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 50/50 biomaterials achieved 40%-80% faster-wound healing when compared with the control on day 7. The data from the histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 20/80 and 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 50/50 treatments led to more AAM phenotypes (CD206) and arginase I production in wound tissue than the control during the first 7 days, i.e., suggesting pro-healing wound microenvironment with improved re-epithelialization of wound healing. A similar trend was retained until day 14. The 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 20/80 and 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 50/50 treatments also increased the collagen deposition and angiogenesis in the healing wound between day 7 and day 14. Both in vitro and in vivo data of this study showed that this new family of NOArg-Arg co-PEA biomaterials have the potential as viable alternatives for treating impaired wound healing, such as diabetic or other types of chronic wounds. Statement of Significance Diabetic or other chronic wounds is usually associated with an overproduction of NO and pro inflammatory signals by macrophages. Arginine supplement or NOS inhibitors administration failed to achieve an expected improved wound healing because of the dynamic complexity of arginine catabolism, the difficulty in transition from pro-inflammatory to pro-healing, and the short-term efficacy. We designed and synthesized a new family of water-soluble and degradable nitroarginine-arginine polyester amides to rebalance NOS/arginase metabolism pathways of macrophages. They showed tunable immunomodulating properties in vitro. The in vivo studies were performed to evaluate their efficacy in accelerating the healing. These new biomaterials have the potential as viable alternatives for treating impaired wound healing. The general audience of Acta Biomaterialia should be interested in these findings.

In this work, we present the synthesis of a series of injectable electroactive degradable hydrogels with rapid self-healing ability and their potential application as cell delivery vehicles for skeletal muscle regeneration. Self-healable conductive injectable hydrogels based on dextran-graft-aniline tetramer-graft-4-formylbenzoic acid and N-carboxyethyl chitosan were synthesized at physiological conditions. The dynamic Schiff base bonds between the formylbenzoic acid and amine group from N-carboxyethyl chitosan endowed the hydrogels with rapid self-healing ability, which was verified by rheological test. Equilibrated swelling ratio, morphology, mechanical strength, electrochemistry and conductivity of the injectable hydrogels were fully investigated. The self-healable conductive hydrogels showed an in vivo injectability and a linear-like degradation behavior. Two different kinds of cells (C2C12 myoblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)) were encapsulated in the hydrogels by self-healing effect. The L929 fibroblast cell culture results indicated the biocompatibility of the hydrogels. Moreover, the C2C12 myoblast cells were released from the conductive hydrogels with a linear-like profile. The in vivo skeletal muscle regeneration was also studied in a volumetric muscle loss injury model. All these data indicated that these biodegradable self-healing conductive hydrogels are potential candidates as cell delivery vehicles and scaffolds for skeletal muscle repair. Statement of Significance Injectable hydrogels with self-healing and electrical conductivity properties are excellent candidates as tissue-engineered scaffolds for myoblast cell therapy and skeletal muscle regeneration. The self healing property of these hydrogels can prolong their lifespan. However, most of the reported conductive hydrogels are not degradable or do not have the self-healing ability. Herein, we synthesized antibacterial conductive self-healing hydrogels as a cell delivery carrier for cardiac cell therapy based on chitosan-grafted-tetraaniline hydrogels synthesized in our previous work. However, an acid solution was used to dissolve the polymers in that study, which may induce toxicity to cells.

It remains a significant challenge to prevent postoperative IUAs because of the complications of various clinical preventive measures and incompatibility of uterine cavity morphology. Herein, we present a new drug-loaded porous scaffold based on a microfluidic droplet template, which combines the characteristics of the artificial biocompatible material GelMA and the natural polysaccharide material Na-alginate. By changing the containers that collect the microfluidic droplets, the porous scaffold conforming to the shape of the uterine cavity could be obtained. The porous structure, mechanical property, and flexibility impart the scaffold with compressibility and send it to the uterus through the vagina. In addition, the external-internal connected open structures could load and control the release of drugs to repair the damaged region continuously in vivo. To verify the antiadhesion and repair of drug loaded porous scaffolds, we tested the system in the rat model of IUAs, and it was demonstrated that the system had the ability to improve neovascularization, cellularize the damaged tissue, and repair the endometrium. These features provide the drug-loaded porous scaffolds with new options for the improvement of postoperative IUAs. Statement of Significance Intrauterine adhesions are caused by various causes of damage to the endometrial basal layer, thus leading to part or entire adhesions in the cervical or uterine cavity. Clinically, various preventive measures reach the barrier effect through the physical barrier, which are difficult to further promote the repair of the damaged endometrium, and most of them have apparent side effects. This study aims to prepare compressible and biodegradable three-dimensional porous drug-loading biological scaffolds. GelMA and Na-alginate have desirable biocompatibility. The interconnect porous scaffolds, which were prepared through the combination of biomaterials and single emulsion microfluidics, not only have compressibility but also provide space for drug delivery and release. This system can further promote the repair of the endometrium while preventing adhesion. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, the development of AMP-based coatings is a very promising strategy to prevent biomaterials-associated infections. This work aims to investigate if Dhvar-5-chitosan conjugates, previously synthesized by us via azide-alkyne ""click"" reaction, can be applied as antimicrobial coatings. Ultrathin coatings were prepared by spin coater after dissolving Dhvar-5-chitosan conjugate powder in aqueous acetic acid. Peptide orientation and exposure from the surface was confirmed by ellipsometry and contact angle measurements. Bactericidal activity was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most prevalent pathogens in implant-associated infections. Results showed that Dhvar-5-chitosan coatings displayed bactericidal effect. Moreover, since Dhvar-5 has head-to-tail amphipathicity, it was clear that the bactericidal potency was dependent on which domain of the peptide (cationic or hydrophobic) was exposed. In this context, Dhvar-5 immobilized through its C-terminus (exposing its hydrophobic end) presented higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and reduced adhesion of Gram-negative bacteria. This orientation-dependent antimicrobial activity was further corroborated by the anti-biofilm assay, as covalent immobilization of Dhvar-5 through its C-terminus provided anti-biofilm properties to the chitosan thin film. Immobilization of Dhvar-5 showed no cytotoxic effect against HFF-1 cells, as both metabolic activity and cell morphology were similar to control. In conclusion, Dhvar-5-chitosan coatings are promising antimicrobial surfaces without cytotoxic effects against human cells. Statement of Significance AMP-tethering onto ground biomaterial is still a poorly explored strategy in research. In this work, AMP tethered ground chitosan is used to produce highly antibacterial ultrathin films. Powdered AMP-tethered chitosan appears as an alternative solution for antimicrobial devices production, as it is suitable for large scale production, being easier to handle for fabrication of different coatings and materials with antimicrobial properties and without inducing toxicity.

Here, we present a step-wise topological design of FGPB based on diamond unit cells to mimic the structure of the femoral diaphysis. The FGPB was manufactured from Ti-6Al-4V powder using the selective laser melting (SLM) technique. The morphological parameters, permeability and mechanical properties of FGPB samples were measured and compared with those of the biomaterials with uniform porous structures based on the same type of the unit cell. The FGPB exhibited a low density (1.9 g/cm(3)), a moderate Young's modulus (10.44 GPa), a high yield stress (170.6 MPa), a high maximum stress (201 MPa) and favorable ductility, being superior to the biomaterials with uniform porous structures in comprehensive mechanical properties. In addition, digital image correlation (DIC) and finite element (FE) simulation were used to unravel the mechanisms governing the deformation and yielding behavior of these biomaterials particularly at the strut junctions. Both DIC and FE simulations confirmed that the deformation and yielding of the FGPB occurred largely in the load-bearing layers but not at the interfaces between layers. Defect-coupled FE models based on solid elements provided further insights into the mechanical responses of the FGPB to compressive loads at both macro- and micro-scales. With the defect-coupled representative volume element model for the FGPB, the Young's modulus and yield stress of the FGPBs were predicted with less than 2% deviations from the experimental data. The study clearly demonstrated the capabilities of combined experimental and computational methods to resolve the uncertainties of the mechanical behavior of FGPBs, which would open up the possibilities of applying various porosity variation strategies for the design of biomimetic AM porous biomaterials. Statement of Significance Functionally graded bone scaffolds significantly promote the recovery of segmental bone defect. In the present study, we present a step-wise topological design of functionally graded porous biomaterial (FGPB) to mimic the structure of the femoral diaphysis. The Ti-6Al-4V FGPB exhibited a superior combination of low density, moderate Young's modulus, high yield stress and maximum stress as well as favorable ductility. The biomechanical performance of FGPB was studied in both macro and micro perspectives. The defect-coupled model revealed the significant yielding in the load-bearing parts and the Young's modulus and yield stress of the FGPBs were predicted with less than 2% deviations from the experimental data. The superiority of combined experimental and computational methods has been confirmed. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DNA-template self-assembly is one of the most attractive strategies to guide the formation of chromophore aggregates. However, the DNA templates are mainly limited to canonical nucleic acids structures [single (ss)- and double (ds)-stranded DNA]. DNA G-quadruplexes (GQs), with distinct and various structural features, were rarely exploited to guide the formation of dye aggregates. In this study, we present the spontaneous assembly of cyanine dye IR786 to form H-aggregates on DNA GQs exclusively, but no IR786 aggregates formed by adjusting the experimental parameters or on ss-/ds-DNA. Furthermore, on the basis of the assembly entity (GQs IR786), an adaptive GQs-FID (fluorescence intercalator displacement) assay for screening of GQs ligands was developed. In contrast with the existing GQs-FID screening schemes, this assay displayed attractive performance in many aspects (such as turn-on signal output, broad screening range, and time saving). All these results have undoubtedly demonstrated the great values of DNA GQs as a template to guide the formation of dye aggregates. We hope that more GQs structures would be exploited as templates to expand the variety of functional materials in the future. Moreover, the specifically formed H-aggregates of IR786 on GQs are significant for GQs' detection, and we also expect that this GQs-FID assay would be further studied and finally applied to screen GQs ligands in a high-throughput manner in the future.","[Wang, Bo-Lin; Jiang, Chuang] Sichuan Univ, Coll Chem, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Wang, BL (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Chem, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",xjtzxy2013@sina.com,,,National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China [2013CB328900],This work was financially supported by the National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (2013CB328900).,,58,0,0,3,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0003-2700,1520-6882,,ANAL CHEM,Anal.

After that CS polycation and PMA polyanion thin films LbL formed on PTX/CS NF coatings. The LbL structure was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle. The drug release in vitro indicated that the PMA modified PTX/CS NF coatings (PTX/CS-PMA NF coatings) showed a sustained slower release of PTX drug. The LbL coatings containing phosphorylcholine groups could significantly reduce proteins adsorption, platelets adhesion and cell adhesion. They showed a lower platelet (about 6%) and protein (30-40%) (bovine serum albumin, BSA; bovine plasma fibrinogen, Fg) adhesion. Meanwhile, the adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was also found reduced. These results demonstrate that the preparation of PMA modified coatings is a simple strategy to improve the hemocompatibility of PTX/CS NF coatings, has good potential for application in blood-contacting materials and devices. Statement of significance: We develop a simple method to improve the hemocompatibility of paclitaxel/chitosan (PTX/CS) nanofibers (NF) coatings, which can significantly reduce the protein adsorption, and the adhesion of cells and platelets. Using layer by layer (LbL) assembly with PMA polyanion and CS polycation, multilayered PMA/CS films formed on the PTX/CS NF coatings. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle characterization demonstrated that a cell outer membrane mimetic structure was formed on the PTX/CS NF coatings. The hemocompatibility of modified surface was significantly improved as shown by 94% adhesion suppression for platelets and 60-70% adsorption suppression for bovine plasma fibrinogen (Fg) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The drug release in vitro indicated that the PMA modified PTX/CS NF (PTX/CS-PMA) coatings had a sustained drug release. Thus this paper provides a facile method for fabricating cell outer membrane mimetic structure which can improve hemocompatibility of blood-contacting material surfaces.","[Liu, Yongjia; Ma, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Tongtong; Wang, Ruibin; Hou, Jingwen; Tang, Jing; Zhu, Bangshang; Su, Yue; Zhu, Xinyuan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Instrumental Anal Ctr, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composites, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bangshang] Donghua Univ, State Key Lab Modificat Chem Fibers & Polymer Mat, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China","Zhu, BS (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Instrumental Anal Ctr, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",bshzhu@sjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51373099]; Donghua University [LK1411],Support of this work by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 51373099) and open funds of Donghua University (LK1411) is gratefully acknowledged.,,33,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0257-8972,,,SURF COAT TECH,Surf.

But compared with an autologous bone graft, these artificial scaffolds still have limitations in terms of the osteogenic capacity and mechanical properties including excellent strength and toughness of super-light natural bone. In this study, we aimed to construct a bone scaffold with both a biomimetic multi-level hierarchical structure and similar constituents of a natural bone using HA/collagen composite nanofibers. The electrospinning technique and rolling method were used for bottom-up synthesis of this artificial system from nano-level to micro-level and then to macro-level. MicroCT scanning and scanning electron microscopy confirmed successful preparation of the bone scaffold composed of fully assembled microscopic fibers. The mechanical properties of the mineralized scaffolds were double reinforced by a large number of newborn HA nano particles and the chemical bonds. The bonds were formed between HA and collagen within and between the layers of the scaffold's matrix membrane. The scaffold showed an excellent biocompatibility profile.

Although a considerable amount of progress has been made in this field, additional research work is required to overcome various remaining challenges. Recently, one of the actively researched areas lies in the AM of smart materials and structures. Electroactive materials incorporated in 3D printing have given birth to 4D printing, where 3D printed structures can perform as actuating and/or sensing systems, making it possible to deliver electrical signals under external mechanical stimuli and vice versa. In this paper, we present a lightweight, low cost piezoelectric material based on the dispersion of inorganic ferroelectric submicron particles in a polymer matrix. We report on how the proposed material is compatible with the AM process. Finally, we discuss its potential applications for healthcare, especially in smart implants prostheses.

The structures and properties of the four PLA nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, limiting oxygen index (LOI) testing, UL-94 vertical testing, and cone calorimetry measurements. The XRD and TEM tests showed that the DOPO-Ca-MMT nanocompound existed in both intercalated and exfoliated montmorillonite morphologies in the PLA matrix, a better dispersion state than the Ca-MMT added alone and DOPO+Ca-MMT in PLA; this benefited improvements in the crystallinity, thermal stability, and flame retardancy for the PLA/DOPO-Ca-MMT nanocomposite, as seen in the higher degree of crystallinity, higher LOI values, and lower peak heat-release rate. A loading of only 5 wt % DOPO-Ca-MMT increased the LOI value of PLA from 20.0 to 28.3% and made the PLA pass the UL-94 vertical test V-0 rating at a 3.2 mm thickness. The nanocomposites based on DOPO-Ca-MMT could be used as very efficient systems for flame-retardant PLA. The PLA/DOPO-Ca-MMT also had better tensile mechanical properties than the pure PLA and PLA/DOPO+Ca-MMT. The annealing specimens of the four nanocomposites were also characterized to study the relationship between the PLA crystallization and flame retardancy or mechanical properties.

Grafting is verified through nuclear magnetic resonance CH NMR) and other spectroscopic techniques along with the hydrodynamic volume measurement of grafted species and the degree of substitution has been calculated from the integrated peak areas. Thermal and mechanical stability of the graft copolymers have improved significantly with respect to cyclodextrin and the formation of smaller blobs having larger in number has been obtained from small angle neutron scattering, atomic force microscopy and optical images. Sustained drug delivery has been achieved using graft copolymer as opposed to burst release in pure cyclodextrin and polyurethane and the phenomenon is understood from the specific interactions, as observed though spectroscopic and thermal measurement, between graft copolymer and drug followed by this novel architecture of the graft copolymers. Biocompatibility of graft copolymers has been checked using cellular studies through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenylte trazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cell adhesion. Importantly, the cell killing efficiency has been demonstrated by embedding anti-cancer drug in polymer matrices causing mortality rate of 80% using graft copolymer against meagre 20% using pure drug or drug embedded in cyclodextrin and the result is realised from the sustained release of drug from the graft copolymer vis-vis burst release in other systems. Cellular studies have been translated into an animal model showing the efficacy of newly developed patch, made of drug embedded in copolymer, towards the significant suppression of tumors in mice as compared to control. Histopathological images and biochemical parameters indicate the normal body organ/blood in copolymer treated mice against severely damaged organ especially liver/blood in the mice treated with pure drug or drug embedded in cyclodextrin arising from burst release. Thus, graft copolymer with unique architecture is found to be an effective drug delivery vehicle for melanoma cancer treatment without side effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Porosity of Ch-Agrs scaffolds was constant at 93%, whilst pore sizes varied between 150 and 550 mu m. Pore sizes of the blend scaffolds (150-300 mu m) were significantly smaller than for either agarose or chitosan scaffolds alone (ca. 500 mu m). Ch50-Agrs50 blend scaffold showed the highest compressive modulus and strength values (4.5 +/- 0.4 and 0.35 +/- 0.03 MPa) due to reduction in the pore size. The presence of agarose improved the stability of the blends in aqueous media. The increase in compressive properties and residual weight after the TGA test, combined with the reduction in the swelling percentage of the blend scaffolds suggested an interaction between chitosan and agarose via hydrogen bonding which was confirmed using FTIR analysis. All wet blend scaffolds exhibited instant recovery after full compression. This study shows the potential of Ch-Agrs scaffolds for repairing soft tissue.","[Felfel, Reda M.; Gideon-Adeniyi, Mark J.; Hossain, Kazi M. Zakir; Roberts, George A.

Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) immobilized dextran (Dex-GMA) was oxidized by periodate to introduce aldehyde groups (oxidized Dex-GMA). The hydrogel was formed by the addition of dithiothreitol to the oxidized Dex-GMA solution through thiol Michael addition with the preservation of the aldehyde group for degradation points. It was experimentally determined that the degradation of this hydrogel can be controlled by the addition of amino groups and the speed of degradation can be controlled independently of mechanical properties because crosslinking and degradation points are different. In addition, the molecular mechanism of the crosslinking between the thiol and aldehyde groups was found to control the degradation of dextran derivatives. It is expected that these results will be beneficial in the design of polymer materials in which the speed of degradation can be precisely controlled. In addition, the cytotoxicity of oxidized Dex-GMA was approximately 3000 times lower than that of glutaraldehyde. The low cytotoxicity of the aldehyde in oxidized Dex-GMA was the likely reason for the harmless functionalized polysaccharide material. Possible future clinical applications include cell scaffolds in regenerative medicine and carriers for drug delivery systems.","[Nonsuwan, Punnida; Matsumura, Kazuaki] Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan; [Nonsuwan, Punnida] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, 254 Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Matsugami, Akimasa; Hayashi, Fumiaki] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, NMR Sci & Dev Div, NMR Res & Collaborat Grp, Adv NMR Applicat & Platform Team,Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Hyon, Suong-Hyu] Kagoshima Univ, Joint Fac Vet Med, 1-21-24 Korimoto, Kagoshima 8908580, Japan","Matsumura, K (reprint author), Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.",mkazuaki@jaist.ac.jp,,,,,,42,1,1,21,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8617,1879-1344,,CARBOHYD POLYM,Carbohydr.

Understanding the protein adsorption mechanisms, kinetics, and thermodynamics is essential to improve the design of new biocompatible materials and to control protein interaction with solid surfaces. Magnesium and its alloys are promising materials for biodegradable metallic devices due to several advantages, including reduced stress shielding effect in the case of orthopedic implants, and removing the requirement of a second surgery for implant removal. Appropriate protein adsorption on magnesium and Mg alloys is essential for applications in bone tissue regeneration and for the effective integration of Mg implants. In this review, we summarize and discuss previous studies on magnesium-protein interactions, including the adsorption of proteins on Mg surfaces as well as the influence of proteins on Mg corrosion. In most cases, the influence of protein adsorption on magnesium corrosion was determined using polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show inhibited degradation due to insoluble salt formation (barrier layer) or formation of unstable and porous layers followed by higher corrosion rates depending on the substrate (cpMg or alloys) and/or media. A comparison of the use of different solutions on surface reactions (with and without proteins) is presented and the influence of corrosion layer formation is discussed. In this review, the influence of substrate and media on corrosion mechanism and protein adsorption on magnesium and magnesium alloys is highlighted, which significantly affects the in-vivo and in-vitro corrosion behavior, being thus of high relevance for the application of Mg and Mg alloys in medicine.","[Hoehn, Sarah; Virtanen, Sannakaisa] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Surface Sci & Corros, Martensstr 7, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Hoehn, Sarah; Boccaccini, Aldo R.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Inst Biomat, Cauerstr 6, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Virtanen, S (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Surface Sci & Corros, Martensstr 7, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.; Boccaccini, AR (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Inst Biomat, Cauerstr 6, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",virtanen@ww.uni-erlangen.de; aldo.boccaccini@ww.uni-erlangen.de,,"Boccaccini, Aldo/0000-0002-7377-2955","DFG (German Science Foundation) through the Cluster of Excellence ""Engineering of Advanced Materials (EAM)"" at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg [EXC 315]","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from DFG (German Science Foundation) through the Cluster of Excellence ""Engineering of Advanced Materials (EAM)"", project EXC 315, at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.",,89,3,3,90,90,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-4332,1873-5584,,APPL SURF SCI,Appl.

Mechanical properties, such as hardness, H, and Young's modulus, E, values, and therefore elastoplastic response of the coating were characterized through H/E, and H-3/E-2 ratios as a function of the extent of the martensitic transformation. These ratios were correlated to the elastic response and to the resistance to plastic deformation of a surface subjected to sliding mechanical contact, respectively. The usefulness of both ratios to design ""hard and tough"" coatings, suitable for enhancing of its wear resistance, is compared with the tenacity, G, the semiquantitative, FT, and the quantitative, K-I, fracture toughness values obtained from nano-scratch characterization. Results show that Ti-22Nb-10Zr (wt.%) coating with the highest and lowest hardness and Young's modulus values, and therefore the highest H/E and H-3/E-2, has the highest cracking resistance and fracture toughness. Under linearly ramped loading from 0.1 to 5 and 100 mN it was impossible to produce fracture of the coating when it was deposited with a bias voltage of -63 V. In return, the coating deposited with a bias voltage of - 148 V shows an almost complete elastic recovery until the moment of its fracture and delamination, which is an evidence of its high tenacity and superior fracture toughness. The K-I value is similar to 21 MPa*m(1/2), which is higher than typical values of bio-ceramics (Al2O3 and ZrO2) used in medical applications, demonstrating that this coating could be used in components subjected to high wear and cyclic impacts, e.g. on femoral heads in artificial hip joints.","[Frutos, E.; Polcar, T.] Czech Tech Univ, Dept Control Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Tech 2, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Karlik, M.] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Dept Mat, Trojanova 13, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic; [Karlik, M.] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Phys Mat, Ke Karlovu 5, Prague 12116 2, Czech Republic; [Polcar, T.] Univ Southampton, nCATS, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Frutos, E (reprint author), Czech Tech Univ, Dept Control Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Tech 2, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",frutoemi@fel.cvut.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [14-32801P]; EPSRC [EP/K005103/1]; ERDF [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000485];  [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008396],The authors wish to express their thanks for the financial support of the Czech Science Foundation through the project 14-32801P.

The present study aims at improving the wear resistance of the polymeric part and the wear-corrosion resistance of the metallic part in the CoCrMo-UHMWPE (ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene) pair. To achieve this end, magnesia-stabilized zirconia coating was fabricated on CoCrMo alloy via a sol-gel route while mull-layer graphene flakes (G) were incorporated in the UHMWPE matrix. Results of the linear reciprocating wear test between the articulating members in bovine serum at 37 degrees C for 10(6) cycles show significant improvement in tribological behavior of UHMWPE and in corrosion resistance of CoCrMo under abrasive wear. The coefficient of friction and wear mass loss were both reduced to about one half as compared with those between the untreated members. The improvement in wear resistance could be attributed to the presence of graphene in the UHMWPE matrix, which acted as a reservoir of solid lubricant. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements before and during the wear test showed significantly higher corrosion resistance of CoCrMo-ZrO2 (about 19.5 times) as compared with bare CoCrMo, attributable to the hard and inert ZrO2 coating.

However, epitope vaccines are associated with limited immunity, which can be overcome by conjugating antigenic epitopes with built-in adjuvants (e.g., some carrier proteins or new biomaterials) with special properties, including immunologic specificity, good biosecurity and biocompatibility, and the ability to vastly improve the immune response of epitope vaccines. When designing epitope vaccines, the following types of built-in adjuvants are typically considered: (1) pattern recognition receptor ligands (i.e., toll-like receptors); (2) virus-like particle carrier platforms; (3) bacterial toxin proteins; and (4) novel potential delivery systems (e.g., self-assembled peptide nanoparticles, lipid core peptides, and polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles).

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have various advantages compared to other stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); thus, MSCs have been intensely investigated in recent studies. However, they are placed in a harsh environment after isolation and transplantation, and the adverse microenvironment substantially reduces the viability and therapeutic effects of MSCs. Intriguingly, melatonin (MT), which is primarily secreted by the pineal organ, has been found to influence the fate of MSCs during various physiological and pathological processes. In this review, we will focus on the recent progress made regarding the influence of MT on stem cell biology and its implications for regenerative medicine. In addition, several biomaterials have been proven to significantly improve the protective effects of MT on MSCs by controlling the release of MT. Collectively, MT will be a promising agent for enhancing MSC activities and the regenerative capacity via the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the release of immune factors in regenerative medicine.","[Hu, Chenxia; Li, Lanjuan] Zhejiang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Infect Dis,Sch Med, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Li, LJ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Infect Dis,Sch Med, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",ljli@zju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81700553]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0101001]; Postdoctoral Research Foundation China [2017 M183789]; Stem Cell and Translational Research,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.: 81700553), the Stem Cell and Translational Research, the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFA0101001), and the Postdoctoral Research Foundation China (No. 2017 M183789).",,73,0,0,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1757-6512,,,STEM CELL RES THER,Stem Cell Res.

However, implant surfaces that support osteointegration may also favor colonization of bacterial cells. Infection of biomaterials and subsequent biofilm formation can have devastating effects and reduce patient quality of life, representing an emerging concern in healthcare. Conversely, efforts toward inhibiting bacterial colonization may impair biomaterial-tissue integration. Therefore, to improve the long-term success of medical implants, biomaterial surfaces should ideally discourage the attachment of bacteria without affecting eukaryotic cell functions. However, most current strategies seldom investigate a combined goal. This work reviews recent strategies of surface modification to simultaneously address implant biointegration while mitigating bacterial infections. To this end, two emerging solutions are considered, multifunctional chemical coatings and nanotopographical features.","[Mas-Moruno, Carlos] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Biomat Biomech & Tissue Engn Grp, Barcelona 08019, Spain; [Mas-Moruno, Carlos] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Multiscale Sci & Engn, Barcelona 08019, Spain; [Su, Bo] Univ Bristol, Bristol Dent Sch, Bristol BS1 2LY, Avon, England; [Dalby, Matthew J.] Univ Glasgow, Ctr Cell Engn, Glasgow G12, Lanark, Scotland","Mas-Moruno, C (reprint author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Biomat Biomech & Tissue Engn Grp, Barcelona 08019, Spain.; Mas-Moruno, C (reprint author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Multiscale Sci & Engn, Barcelona 08019, Spain.",carles.mas.moruno@upc.edu,,"Mas-Moruno, Carlos/0000-0001-8337-0872","Spanish Government - European Union through European Regional Development Funds [RYC-2015-18566, MAT2015-67183-R, MAT2017-83905-R]; Government of Catalonia [2017 SGR1165]; European Commission (REA) [321985]; EPSRC [EP/K034898/1]","C.M.-M. thanks the Spanish Government for financial support through a Ramon y Cajal grant (Grant No. RYC-2015-18566) and Project Nos.

GFs play a key role in tissue regeneration, but one major limitation of GF-based therapies is dosage-related adverse effects. Additionally, the clinical applications and efficacy of GFs are significantly affected by the efficiency of delivery systems and other pharmacokinetic factors. Hence, it is crucial to design delivery systems that provide optimal activity, stability, and tunable delivery for GFs. Understanding the physicochemical properties of the GFs and the biomaterials utilized for the development of biomimetic GF delivery systems is critical for GF-based regeneration. Many different delivery systems have been developed to achieve tunable delivery kinetics for single or multiple GFs. The identification of ideal biomaterials with tunable properties for spatiotemporal delivery of GFs is still challenging. This review characterizes the types, properties, and functions of GFs, the materials science of widely used biomaterials, and various GF loading strategies to comprehensively summarize the current delivery systems for tunable spatiotemporal delivery of GFs aimed for tissue regeneration applications. This review concludes by discussing fundamental design principles for GF delivery vehicles based on the interactive physicochemical properties of the proteins and biomaterials.","[Subbiah, Ramesh; Guldberg, Robert E.] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Parker H Petit Inst Bioengn & Biosci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Guldberg, Robert E.] Phil & Penny Knight Campus Accelerating Sci Impac, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Guldberg, RE (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Parker H Petit Inst Bioengn & Biosci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.; Guldberg, RE (reprint author), Phil & Penny Knight Campus Accelerating Sci Impac, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",robert.guldberg@me.gatech.edu,,"Subbiah, Ramesh/0000-0003-0044-9740",,,,258,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2192-2640,2192-2659,,ADV HEALTHC MATER,Adv.

In this study, potato biomass porous carbon (PBPC), which was fabricated by a facile two-step carbonization, was used as the anode material for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs). The crystal structure and mesoporous morphology of the carbon derivative at various carbonation temperatures are fully investigated. The electrochemical performance of PBPC electrodes is evaluated, presenting a high reversible specific capacity (248 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), an excellent rate performance (152 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1)) and a superior cycle stability (almost no capacity decay after 400 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) with a Coulombic efficiency about 100%). The superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the uniformly distributed mesopores on PBPC electrode which facilitate the electrolyte transportation and diffusion. This work provides a simple and novel strategy to construct porous carbon as high-performance anode materials for KIBs through a sustainable and environment-friendly way. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the chemical reactivity of PHB was enhanced by the chemical degradation that occurred via beta-elimination through the functionalization of PHB with ethylene glycol to give a low-molecular-weight PHB-diol. The reaction of PHB-diol with acryloyl chloride gave PHB-diacrylate, which was grafted by thiol compounds, such as ethane dithiol, 2-mercaptoethanol, ethane thiol, dithiothreitol, butane thiol, and thioglycolic acid, via a Michael-type addition reaction. The chemical and thermal properties of the functionalized PHB-thiol products were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H-1-NMR, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis techniques. X-ray diffraction showed that the PHB-thiol polymers had slight differences in crystallinity compared with neat PHB. The biological activities of the neat polymer and new PHB-thiol polymers, including the antibacterial and anticancer activities, were tested, and some of these products showed antibacterial and anticancer activities. These anticancer activities were attributed to the ability of these PHB-thiol polymers to induce apoptosis (as revealed by the higher expression of Bax and caspase 9 and the lower expression of Bcl2) and cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which is associated with the higher expression of p53 and p21 and the lower expression of the p53 inhibitor, MDM2. Thus, the anticancer effect of these PHB-thiol polymers may have been due to their ability to inhibit MDM2-p53 interactions. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Previously, we have demonstrated that a composite material of silk biopolymer and the conducting polymer poly(pyrrole) (PPy) can be formed into a functional bilayer bending actuator. Further, these silk-PPy composites can generate forces comparable to human muscle (>0.1 MPa) making them ideal candidates for interfacing with biological tissues. Here, we explore the performance of these silk-PPy composite bilayer actuators under biologically relevant conditions including exposure to proteins, serum, enzymes, and biologically relevant temperatures. Free-end bending actuation performance, current response, force generation, and mass degradation under these conditions were investigated. We find that under the conditions tested here, the performance of our silk-PPy composites is sensitive to both protein serum and enzyme type, as well as to the temperature at which the devices are actuated. However, the silk-PPy actuators retained their functionality under all conditions tested, demonstrating the ability to bend, generate forces, and conduct currents at comparable levels to devices tested under standard operating conditions. The results suggest that our silk-PPy actuators are promising candidates for implantation in vivo and for interfacing with biological systems. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Thus, fibroin has been widely explored in biomedical applications as biodegradable films as well as functional microstructures. Although there exists a large number of patterning methods for fibroin thin films, multilayer micropatterning of fibroin films interleaved with metal layers still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new wafer-scale multilayer microfabrication process named aluminum hard mask on silk fibroin (AMoS), which is capable of micropatterning multiple layers composed of both fibroin and inorganic materials (e.g., metal and dielectrics) with high-precision microscale alignment. To the best of our knowledge, our AMoS process is the first demonstration of wafer-scale multilayer processing of both silk fibroin and metal micropatterns. In the AMoS process, aluminum deposited on fibroin is first micropatterned using conventional ultraviolet (UV) photolithography, and the patterned aluminum layer is then used as a mask to pattern fibroin underneath. We demonstrate the versatility of our fabrication process by fabricating fibroin microstructures with different dimensions, passive electronic components composed of both fibroin and metal layers, and functional fibroin microstructures for drug delivery. Furthermore, because one of the crucial advantages of fibroin is biocompatibility, we assess the biocompatibility of our fabrication process through the culture of highly susceptible primary neurons. Because the AMoS process utilizes conventional UV photolithography, the principal advantages of our process are multilayer fabrication with high-precision alignment, high resolution, wafer-scale large area processing, no requirement for chemical modification of the protein, and high throughput and thus low cost, all of which have not been feasible with silk fibroin. Therefore, the proposed fabrication method is a promising candidate for batch fabrication of functional fibroin microelectronics (e.g., memristors and organic thin film transistors) for next-generation implantable biomedical applications.","[Kook, Geon; Kim, Mi Kyung; Lee, Sungwoo; Lee, Hyunjoo J.] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Sch Elect Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Jeong, Sohyeon; Kim, So Hyun; Cho, Il-Joo; Choi, Nakwon] Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Brain Sci Inst, Ctr BioMicrosyst, 5 Hwarang Ro 14 Gil, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Jeong, Sohyeon; Cho, Il-Joo; Choi, Nakwon] Korea Univ Sci & Technol UST, KIST Sch, Div Biomed Sci & Technol, 5 Hwarang Ro 14 Gil, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Kim, So Hyun] SK Biopharmaceut Co Ltd, 221 Pangyoyeok Ro, Seongnam Si 13494, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Lee, HJ (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Sch Elect Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.; Choi, N (reprint author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Brain Sci Inst, Ctr BioMicrosyst, 5 Hwarang Ro 14 Gil, Seoul 02792, South Korea.; Choi, N (reprint author), Korea Univ Sci & Technol UST, KIST Sch, Div Biomed Sci & Technol, 5 Hwarang Ro 14 Gil, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",nakwon.choi@kist.re.kr; hyunjoo.lee@kaist.ac.kr,,"Choi, Nakwon/0000-0003-2993-9233","Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea [HI15C3155]; Engineering Research Center of Excellence (ERC) Program - National Research Foundation (NRF), Korean Ministry of Science ICT (MSIT) [NRF-2017R1A5A1014708]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korea government (MSIT) [2016R1C1B2009798]","This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: HI15C3155), by the Engineering Research Center of Excellence (ERC) Program supported by National Research Foundation (NRF), Korean Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT) (Grant No. NRF-2017R1A5A1014708), and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2016R1C1B2009798).",,60,0,0,10,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

The localized release dosage of effectors could be controlled by the change of environmental temperature. At a culture temperature above the lower critical solution temperature, the polymer ""gatekeeper"" with a collapsed conformation allowed the release of S1P, which in turn enhanced the migration of ECs. The migration rate of single cells was significantly enhanced up to 58.5%, and the collective migration distance was also promoted to 25.1% at 24 h and 33.2% at 48 h. The cell morphology, focal adhesion, organization of cytoskeleton, and expression of genes and proteins related to migration were studied to unveil the intrinsic mechanisms. The cell mobility was regulated by the released S1P, which would bind with the S1PR1 receptor on the cell membrane and trigger the Rho GTPase pathway.","[Wu, Sai; Zhang, Deteng; Bai, Jun; Du, Wang; Duan, Yiyuan; Gao, Changyou] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Macromol Synth & Functionalizat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yixiao; Zou, Xiaohui; Ouyang, Hongwei] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Stem Cell & Tissue Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Hongwei; Gao, Changyou] Zhejiang Univ, Dr Li Dak Sum & Yip Yio Chin Ctr Stem Cell & Rege, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Gao, CY (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Macromol Synth & Functionalizat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Gao, CY (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Dr Li Dak Sum & Yip Yio Chin Ctr Stem Cell & Rege, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",cygao@zju.edu.cn,,"Gao, Changyou/0000-0001-5084-7208","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1100403]; Natural Science Foundation of China [21434006]; 111 Project of China [B16042]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017XZZX001-03B, 2017XZZX008-05]","This work is financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1100403), the Natural Science Foundation of China (21434006), the 111 Project of China (B16042), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017XZZX001-03B and 2017XZZX008-05).",,34,0,0,2,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that Si ions evidently stimulated the expression of cardiac-specific genes and proliferation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) at concentration ranges of 0.13-10.78 ppm. Accordingly, the optimized concentrations of calcium silicate (CS) were incorporated into the controllable aligned chitosan electrospun nanofibers, constructing the composite cardiac patch scaffolds. These scaffolds showed synergistic effect of bioactive chemical and structural signals on both cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells with aligned cell morphology and enhanced viability and function characterized by upregulated expressions of cardiac and angiogenic specific markers, improved myofilament structure, and better Ca2+ transients of NRCMs as compared to the scaffolds free of CS component or with disordered structures. The in vivo studies further demonstrated that the NRCM-seeded aligned CS/chitosan cardiac patch evidently improved cardiac function via limiting the scar area and promoting angiogenesis in postmyocardial infarction rats. Conclusively, our study highlights the potential application of bioactive ions and nanostructured biomaterials in CTE, and the CS/chitosan composite cardiac patch may be a promising scaffold for repair of infarcted myocardium.","[Wang, Xiaotong; Bao, Feng; Chang, Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Ceram, State Key Lab High Performance Ceram & Superfine, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China; [Wang, Leyu; Qiu, Xiaozhong] Southern Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Sch Basic Med Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Construct & Detect Tissue, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qiang; Yang, Huangtian] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, CAS Key Lab Tissue Microenvironm & Tumor, Lab Mol Cardiol,Shanghai Inst Nutr & Hlth, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaotong; Wu, Qiang; Bao, Feng; Yang, Huangtian; Chang, Jiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci CAS, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qiang; Yang, Huangtian; Chang, Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chang, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Ceram, State Key Lab High Performance Ceram & Superfine, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China.; Qiu, XZ (reprint author), Southern Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Sch Basic Med Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Construct & Detect Tissue, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Yang, HT (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, CAS Key Lab Tissue Microenvironm & Tumor, Lab Mol Cardiol,Shanghai Inst Nutr & Hlth, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.; Yang, HT; Chang, J (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci CAS, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Yang, HT; Chang, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",htyang@sibs.ac.cn; qqiuxzh@163.com; jchang@mail.sic.ac.cn,,,"National Key Research Program of China [2016YFC1100201, 2017YFA0103700]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA16010203, XDA16010201]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81520108004]; NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund [U1601221]","This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research Program of China (Grant Nos 2016YFC1100201 and 2017YFA0103700), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant Nos XDA16010203 and XDA16010201), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81520108004), and NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (Grant No. U1601221).",,56,0,0,17,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

To make the screening process more rapid and precise, improving the regularity of morphological structure and chemical modification on gradient biomaterials have attracted much attention. In this paper, we present a novel fabrication strategy to introduce ordered nanopattern arrays into gradient biomaterials, through combining surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and inclined reactive-ion etching based on colloidal lithography. Graded protein/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanopattern arrays on a quartz substrate were fabricated and applied to affect the behaviors of cells. Owing to the continuously changed ratio of two different components, the corresponding cell adhesion density along the substrate showed obvious graded distribution after culturing for 24 h. Meanwhile, the cytoskeleton showed obvious polarization after culturing for 7 days, which is parallel with the direction of gradient. Additionally, oriented migration was generated when mouse MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on the graded protein/PEG nanopattern arrays. On the basis of the ordered and well-defined nanopatterns, the correlation between the extracellular matrix and corresponding expressions generated by different stimuli can be investigated.","[Xue, Peihong; Liu, Wendong; Chen, Xingchi; Nan, Jingjie; Zhang, Junhu; Cui, Zhanchen; Yang, Bai] Jilin Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Supramol Struct & Mat, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Gu, Zhongyi] Jilin Univ, Stomatol Hosp, Dept Pathol, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Xue, Peihong] Dalian Maritime Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Sun, Hongchen] China Med Univ, Sch Stomatol, Liaoning Prov Key Lab Oral Dis, Shenyang 110002, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Zhang, JH (reprint author), Jilin Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Supramol Struct & Mat, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zjh@jlu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Junhu/0000-0001-9100-6608; Liu, Wendong/0000-0001-7297-8591","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21774043, 21474037]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3132018111]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 21774043 and 21474037) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (3132018111).,,29,0,0,12,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

In bioprinting, these inks are often hydrogels with controlled rheological properties that can be stabilized after deposition. Here, an alternate approach is developed where the ink is composed exclusively of jammed microgels, which are designed to incorporate a range of properties through microgel design (e.g., composition, size) and through the mixing of microgels. The jammed microgel inks are shear-thinning to permit flow and rapidly recover upon deposition, including on surfaces or when deposited in 3D within hydrogel supports, and can be further stabilized with secondary cross-linking. This platform allows the use of microgels engineered from various materials (e.g., thiol-ene cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA), photo-cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol), thermo-sensitive agarose) and that incorporate cells, where the jamming process and printing do not decrease cell viability. The versatility of this particle-based approach opens up numerous potential biomedical applications through the printing of a more diverse set of inks.","[Highley, Christopher B.; Song, Kwang Hoon; Daly, Andrew C.; Burdick, Jason A.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, 210 South 33rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Burdick, JA (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, 210 South 33rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",burdick2@seas.upenn.edu,,,National Science Foundation through the PENN MRSEC [DMR-1120901]; STC Program [CMMI: 15-48571]; AO Foundation,C.B.H. and K.H.S contributed equally.

The beneficial effects on cardiac function and structure are largely acting through paracrine signaling, which preserve the border-zone around the infarction, reduce apoptosis, blunt adverse remodeling, and promote angiogenesis. Ionic extracts from biomaterials have been proven to stimulate paracrine effects and promote cell-cell communications. Here, the paracrine stimulatory function of bioactive ions derived from biomaterials is integrated into the clinical concept of administration and proposed ""ion therapy"" as a novel strategy for myocardial infarction. In vitro, silicon- enriched ion extracts significantly increase cardiomyocyte viability and promote cell-cell communications, thus stimulating vascular formation via a paracrine effect under glucose/oxygen deprived conditions.

Follicles are not only the source of a female's germ cell supply, but also secrete important hormones necessary for proper endocrine function. Folliculogenesis, the growth and maturation of the follicular unit, is a complex process governed by both intrafollicular crosstalk and pituitary-secreted hormones. While the later stages of this process are gonadotropin-dependent, early folliculogenesis appears to be controlled by the ovarian microenvironment and intrafollicular paracrine and autocrine signaling. In vitro follicle culture remains challenging because of the limited knowledge of growth factors and other cytokines influencing early follicle growth. Here we discuss the current state of knowledge on paracrine and autocrine signaling influencing primary follicles as they develop into the antral stage. Given the importance of intrafollicular signaling and the ovarian microenvironment, we reviewed the current engineering approaches for in vitro follicle culture, including 3D systems using natural hydrogels such as alginate and synthetic hydrogels such as poly(ethylene glycol). Our discussion is focused on what drives the proliferation of granulosa cells, development of the thecal layer, and antrum formationthree processes integral to follicle growth up to the antral stage. Further research in this area may reveal the mechanisms behind these complex signaling relationships within the follicle, leading to more successful and physiologically-relevant in vitro culture methods that will translate well to clinical applications.","[Jones, Andrea S.

The purpose of the study is to analyze the hydroxyapatite (HAP), HAP-TiO2 (25 percent) composite coatings deposited on 316 LSS by High Velocity Flame Spray (HVFS) technique. Design/methodology/approach The coatings exhibit almost uniform and dense microstructure with porosity (HAP = 0.153 and HAP-TiO2 composite = 0.138). Electrochemical corrosion testing was done on the uncoated and coated specimens in Ringer solution (SBF). As-sprayed coatings were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS and cross-sectional X-ray mapping techniques before and after dipping in Ringer solution. Microhardness of composite coating (568.8 MPa) was found to be higher than HAP coating (353 MPa). Findings During investigations, it was observed that the corrosion resistance of steel was found to have increased after the deposition of HAP and HAP-TiO2 composite coatings. Thus, coatings serve as an effective diffusion barrier to prohibit the diffusion of ions from the SBF into the substrate. Composite coatings have been found to be more corrosion resistant as compared to HAP coating in the simulated body fluid.","[Kaur, Sarbjit] IK Gujral Punjab Tech Univ, Dept Appl Sci Chem, Kapurthala, India; [Bala, Niraj] Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Fatehgarh Sahib, India; [Khosla, Charu] Chitkara Univ, Dept Appl Sci, Banur, India","Bala, N (reprint author), Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Fatehgarh Sahib, India.",sarbjit.kaur@bbsbec.ac.in; nirajbala@gmail.com; charu.khosla@chitkara.edu.in,,,,,,53,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-5599,1758-4221,,ANTI-CORROS METHOD M,Anti-Corros.

In this work, ET rates of recombinant CotA laccases have been drastically improved by an immobilization process on sulfonic group-modified graphitic carbon nitride (Sg-CN) materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the enzymes undergo striking conformational changes onto graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), adopting an electrochemically inactive configuration while retain their nativelike structure with a superb ET efficiency on Sg-CN surfaces. In fact, the resulting CotA laccase/Sg-CN biomaterial an ET rate constant of (12 +/- 0.5) s(-1), the highest value reported to date for a direct electron-transfer reaction of multicopper oxidases attached to carbon-based materials. Importantly, the combined parallel tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC) and all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD) theoretical calculations proved CotA incorporation in a highly ordered array with an overall positive surface density composed of lysine and arginine domains in contact with net negatively charged Sg-CN surfaces, which promoted a 1200-fold improvement in the free enzyme ET rate constant. An ET pathway has been put forward that takes into account the orientation of CotA laccase on the Sg-CN surface. Additionally, CotA laccase/Sg-CN biomaterial was tested as an amperometric biosensor delivering outstanding bioelectrocatalytic activities in the oxidation of catechol and syringol, which are relevant emerging pollutants. In fact, the sensitivities of the CotA laccase/Sg-CN/ITO electrodes were 0.95 and 0.41 A.M-1.cm(-2) for catechol and syringol, respectively, surpassing most of the laccase biosensors reported in the literature.","[Puente-Santiago, Alain R.; Rodriguez-Padron, Daily; Munoz Batista, Mario J.; Luque, Rafael] Univ Cordoba, Dept Quim Organ, Grp FQM 383, Campus Rabanales,Edificio Marie Curie C-3, E-14014 Cordoba, Spain; [Quan, Xuebo; Zhou, Jian] South China Univ Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Green Chem Prod Technol, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Martins, Ligia O.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol Antonio Xavier, Ave Republ, P-2780157 Oeiras, Portugal; [Verrna, Sanny] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, POB 117, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Varma, Rajender S.] Palacky Univ, Dept Phys Chem, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Fac Sci, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Luque, Rafael] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia","Puente-Santiago, AR; Luque, R (reprint author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Quim Organ, Grp FQM 383, Campus Rabanales,Edificio Marie Curie C-3, E-14014 Cordoba, Spain.; Zhou, J (reprint author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Green Chem Prod Technol, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",z02pusaa@uco.es; jianzhou@scut.edu.cn; q62alsor@uco.es,"Martins, Ligia/C-2513-2009; Zhou, Jian/E-4504-2011","Martins, Ligia/0000-0003-0082-9591; Zhou, Jian/0000-0002-3033-7785; Varma, Rajender/0000-0001-9731-6228; VERMA, SANNY/0000-0003-3176-3900; Luque, Rafael/0000-0003-4190-1916; Munoz Batista, Mario Jesus/0000-0002-1419-0592","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) - European Fund for Economic and Regional Development (FEDER) funds [CTQ2016-78289-P]; MINECO; European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FP1306]; University of Cordoba; MINECO [FJCI-2016-29014]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21776093, 21376089]; RUDN University Program 5-100","R.L. gratefully acknowledges the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) for funding project CTQ2016-78289-P, cofinanced with European Fund for Economic and Regional Development (FEDER) funds.

In the present study, two oxindolimine complexes based on copper(ii) and zinc(ii) were immobilized in two selective delivery systems, namely, unmodified and modified MCM-41, which can act as carriers of water-insoluble anticancer metallodrugs. Morphological and structural characterizations of these materials were accomplished, and their cytotoxic effect was evaluated on three different cancer cell lines, SKMEL-147, SKMEL-05 and HeLa, in comparison to a non-tumor cell line (fibroblast P4). Cytotoxicity assays showed that both complexes coordinated to the modified matrix were more active and selective than those immobilized into the unmodified matrix, particularly toward SKMEL-147 cells. In contrast, P4 cells were much less affected by the presence of these compounds, with very high IC50 values. Further, the release of the complexes from these materials was monitored in vitro by X-ray fluorescence, which indicated a significant delivery after 2 h at 37 degrees C. By using CytoViva images, it was possible to observe the presence of such nanoparticles inside the cells, as well as the formation of apoptotic bodies due to the action of these antitumor compounds. A high damage on the nucleus was verified by comet and DNA cleavage assays, pointing to DNA as an important target of such metallodrugs. The matrices also contribute to the potential therapeutic action of these metal complexes, significantly increasing their cytotoxicity against melanoma and cervical carcinoma cells.","[Vieira, Eduardo Guimaraes; Miguel, Rodrigo Bernardi; da Silva, Daniel Rodrigues; Fazzi, Rodrigo Boni; Alves de Couto, Ricardo Alexandre; Marin, Jayr Henrique; Arruda Temperini, Marcia Laudelina; Shinohara, Jorge da Silva; Toma, Henrique Eisi; da Costa Ferreira, Ana Maria] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Chem, Dept Fundamental Chem, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Russo, Lilian Cristina; Magalhaes, Yuli Thamires; Forti, Fabio Luiz] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Chem, Dept Biochem, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Dias Filho, Newton Luiz] Univ Sao Paulo State UNESP, Dept Chem & Phys, BR-15385000 Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil","Vieira, EG (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Chem, Dept Fundamental Chem, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",eduardogv5007@gmail.com; amdcferr@iq.usp.br,,"Guimaraes Vieira, Eduardo/0000-0002-3198-3199; Marin, Jayr Henrique/0000-0002-3430-3558; Couto, Ricardo Alexandre/0000-0002-7303-1735; Da Costa Ferreira, Ana Maria/0000-0001-9898-1692","Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2011/50318-1, 2016/21070-5]; network CEPID-Redoxoma (Redox Process in Biomedicine) [2013/07937-8]; FAPESP [2016/16735-8, 2017/21919-3]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001]","The authors are grateful to Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP, Grant 2011/50318-1 and 2016/21070-5), and network CEPID-Redoxoma (Redox Process in Biomedicine, Grant 2013/07937-8) for financial support.

These novel biomaterials represent a promising alternative for product design and manufacturing both in terms of sustainable manufacturing processes and circular lifespan. This study shows that their morphology, density, tensile and flexural strength, as well as their moisture-and water-uptake properties can be tuned by varying type of substrate (straw, sawdust, cotton), fungal species (Pleurotus ostreatus vs. Trametes multicolor) and processing technique (no pressing or cold or heat pressing). The fungal species impacts colonization level and the thickness of the air-exposed mycelium called fungal skin. Colonization level and skin thickness as well as the type of substrate determine the stiffness and water resistance of the materials. Moreover, it is shown that heat pressing improves homogeneity, strength and stiffness of the materials shifting their performance from foam-like to cork-and wood-like. Together, these results demonstrate that by changing the fabrication process, differences in performance of mycelium materials can be achieved. This highlights the possibility to produce a range of mycelium-based composites. In fact, it is the first time mycelium composites have been described with natural material properties.

The rate of reduction observed in biological methodologies is much faster compared to chemical and physical methods. Therefore, this technique is an environment-friendly and cost-efficient alternative against conventional methods, and is also suitable for large scale production. In this research, ZnS nanoparticles were synthesized using a natural sweetener glycoside in the aqueous crude extract of Stevia rebaudiana that acted as an excellent bio-reductant. The structure of synthesized ZnS nanoparticles were examined through XRD, EDAX, SEM, TEM, and FTIR. The average size of ZnS nanoparticles was found to be 8.35 nm while being highly stable and predominantly spherical. The peaks at 3414.82 cm(-1), which were dedicated to the -OH groups from the glucose aqueous crude extract of Stevia, were observed to be very broad and thus, the FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of glucose as a capping agent and stabilizer. The cytotoxic effects of the nanoparticles was studied against the MCF-7 cancer cell line.

Convergence of life sciences and engineering to advance the understanding and treatment of heart failure was the theme of the meeting. Over 150 attendees were present, and >40 scientists presented their latest work on engineering human functional myocardium for disease modeling, drug development, and heart failure research. The scientists, engineers, and physicians in the field of cardiovascular sciences met and discussed the most recent advances in their work and proposed future strategies for overcoming the major roadblocks of cardiovascular bioengineering and therapy. Particular emphasis was given for manipulation and using of stem/progenitor cells, biomaterials, and methods to provide molecular, chemical, and mechanical cues to cells to influence their identity and fate in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these works are profoundly impacting and progressing toward deciphering the mechanisms and developing novel treatments for left ventricular dysfunction of failing hearts. Here, we present some important perspectives that emerged from this meeting.","[Berry, Joel L.; Zhu, Wuqiang; Krishnamurthy, Prasanna; Qin, Gangjian; Rogers, Jack M.; Zhang, Jianyi] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biomed Engn, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Chen, Yabing; Rajasekaran, Namakkal Soorapan] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Prabhu, Sumanth D.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Div Cardiovasc Dis, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Prabhu, Sumanth D.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Med, Comprehens Cardiovasc Ctr, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Tang, Yao Liang] Augusta Univ, Med Coll Georgia, Vasc Biol Ctr, Augusta, GA USA; [Ge, Ying; Kamp, Timothy J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Cell & Regenerat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Cooke, John P.] Houston Methodist Res Inst, Dept Cardiovasc Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Garry, Daniel J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Lillehei Heart Inst, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Yang, Huang-Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Koch, Walter J.] Temple Univ, Lewis Katz Sch Med, Ctr Translat Med, Dept Pharmacol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Li, Song] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Domae, Keitaro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Cheng, Ke] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Mol Biomed Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ye, Lei] Natl Heart Ctr Singapore, Natl Heart Res Inst Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Hu, Shijun] Soochow Univ, Med Coll, Inst Cardiovasc Sci, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Ogle, Brenda M.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Abel, E.

Herein, three additives, composed of matching bisurea groups and antifouling oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) functionalities, are judiciously designed. The first additive is composed of one bisurea and one OEG, the second additive of one bisurea and two OEGs, and the third additive of two bisurea and one OEG. On solution-cast films, non-cell adhesive properties are dependent on the amount of incorporated OEG irrespective of the bisurea design; however, on 3D electrospun scaffolds only the additive that consists of two bisurea moieties connected via an OEG functionality ensures proper non-cell adhesive properties. Interestingly, robust non-cell adhesive properties are maintained, both with repeated cell seeding and after partial enzymatic degradation of the scaffold. These results highlight the importance of additive design in supramolecular functionalization and show that translation from simple 2D solution-cast films to 3D electrospun scaffolds is not trivial with respect to additive presentation and functionality.","[Ippel, Bastiaan D.; Dankers, Patricia Y.

Therapeutics, herein defined as cells, biomaterials, biomolecules, and their combinations, can be delivered in a minimally invasive way to regenerate different tissues in the body, such as bone, cartilage, pancreas, cardiac, skeletal muscle, liver, skin, and neural tissues. Sophisticated methods of tracking, sensing, and stimulation of therapeutics in vivo using nano-biomaterials and soft bioelectronic devices provide great opportunities to further develop minimally invasive and regenerative therapeutics (MIRET). In general, minimally invasive delivery methods offer high yield with low risk of complications and reduced costs compared to conventional delivery methods. Here, minimally invasive approaches for delivering regenerative therapeutics into the body are reviewed. The use of MIRET to treat different tissues and organs is described. Although some clinical trials have been performed using MIRET, it is hoped that such therapeutics find wider applications to treat patients.

Ions and growth factors, although different in their biological nature, induce a common and coordinated chemotactic effect. Conditioned media has been used successfully in bone regeneration by promoting endogenous cell recruitment. Likewise, calcium alone act as a paracrine chemotactic signal, inducing the host's undifferentiated progenitor cell infiltration into the implanted biomaterials. The aim of the present study was to compare the chemotactic effect of calcium and conditioned media in primary calvarial cells. Methods The chemotactic cell response was evaluated in vitro using an agarose spot and a wound healing assay. In addition, we used a calvarial bone explant model ex-vivo. The healing potential was also tested through an in vivo model, a critical-size calvarial bone defect in mice. For the in vivo experiment, cell-free calcium-containing or conditioned media-containing scaffolds were implanted, and MSC's seeded scaffolds were used as positive control. After seven weeks post-implantation, samples were retrieved, and bone regeneration was evaluated by mu CT and histological analysis. Osteogenic gene expression was evaluated by qPCR. Results We found that chemotactic cell migration in response to either calcium or conditioned media was equivalent in vitro and ex vivo. Accordingly, mu CT analysis showed that bone regeneration induced by the MSC's seeded scaffolds was similar to that obtained with cell-free calcium or conditioned media-containing scaffolds. Pre-treatment with SB202190, a highly selective p38 inhibitor, abrogated the chemotactic effect induced by conditioned media. In contrast, p38 activity was not essential for the calcium-induced chemotaxis. Moreover, BAPTA-AM treatment, a cytosolic calcium chelator, decreased the chemotactic effect and the expression of key osteogenic genes induced by calcium or conditioned media. Conclusion We show that calcium ions alone not only mimic the conditioned media chemotactic effect, but also induce an osteogenic effect similar to that produced by transplanted MSC's in vivo. Furthermore, the chemotactic effect induced by conditioned media is calcium and p38 dependent. The rise in cytosolic calcium might integrate the different signaling pathways triggered by conditioned media and extracellular Ca2+. This calcium-driven in situ bone regeneration is a promising and convenient alternative to promote endogenous cell recruitment into the injured bone site. This pre-clinical cell-free and growth factor-free approach might avoid the disadvantages of the ex vivo cell manipulation.","[Aquino-Martinez, Ruben; Ventura, Francesc] Univ Barcelona, IDIBELL, Dept Ciencies Fisiol, Barcelona, Spain; [Aquino-Martinez, Ruben; Monroe, David G.] Mayo Clin, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, Coll Med, Rochester, MN USA","Ventura, F (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, IDIBELL, Dept Ciencies Fisiol, Barcelona, Spain.",fventura@ub.edu,,"Ventura, Francesc/0000-0001-9673-9405","Ministry of Education, Spanish Government [BFU 2014-56313, BFU201782421-P]; N.I.H.

To achieve this target, a novel speckle interference imaging method is proposed by introducing phosphate buffer saline medium, in which the samples were completely placed into a phosphate buffer saline solution medium to stable the water molecules. The stability of interferometry imaging is analyzed by using the concepts of co-occurrence matrix and moment of inertia. A series of experiments to measure load-driven deformation and strain in the bone-implant interface was carried out, and the experiments results were analyzed and discussed. It shows that the proposed method is feasible and effective for the no-contact strain measurements of biomaterials in a physiological condition.

Polyurethanes were obtained from polyols derived from castor oil, and isophorone diisocyanate, with the incorporation of polycaprolactone-diol (15% w/w) and chitosan (3% w/w). The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the type of polyol and the incorporation of polycaprolactone-diol and chitosan on the mechanical and biological properties of the polyurethanes to identify the optimal ones for applications such as wound dressings or tissue engineering. Polyurethanes were characterized by stress-strain, contact angle by sessile drop method, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, water uptake and in vitro degradation by enzymatic processes. In vitro biological properties were evaluated by a 24 h cytotoxicity test using the colorimetric assay MTT and the LIVE/DEAD kit with cell line L-929 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). In vitro evaluation of the possible inflammatory effect of polyurethane-based materials was evaluated by means of the expression of anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines expressed in a cellular model such as THP-1 cells by means of the MILLIPLEX (R) MAP kit. The modification of polyols derived from castor oil increases the mechanical properties of interest for a wide range of applications. The polyurethanes evaluated did not generate a cytotoxic effect on the evaluated cell line. The assessed polyurethanes are suggested as possible candidate biomaterials for wound dressings due to their improved mechanical properties and biocompatibility.","[Uscategui, Yomaira L.] Univ La Sabana, Doctoral Program Biosci, Chia 140013, Colombia; [Uscategui, Yomaira L.; Valero, Manuel F.] Univ La Sabana, Fac Engn, Energy Mat & Environm Grp, Chia 140013, Colombia; [Diaz, Luis E.] Univ La Sabana, Fac Engn, Bioprospecting Res Grp, Chia 140013, Colombia; [Gomez-Tejedor, Jose A.; Valles-Lluch, Ana; Vilarino-Feltrer, Guillermo; Serrano, Maria A.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Biomat & Tissue Engn, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Gomez-Tejedor, Jose A.] Biomed Res Networking Ctr Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Valencia 46022, Spain","Valero, MF (reprint author), Univ La Sabana, Fac Engn, Energy Mat & Environm Grp, Chia 140013, Colombia.",yomairausma@unisabana.edu.co; luis.diaz1@unisabana.edu.co; jogomez@fis.upv.es; avalles@ter.upv.es; guivifel@upv.es; mserranj@fis.upv.es; manuelvv@unisabana.edu.co,,,"UNIVERSIDAD DE LA SABANA [ING-202-2018]; COLCIENCIAS [617-2-2014]; VI National R&D&I Plan 2008-2011, Iniciativa Ingenio 2010, Consolider Program; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) (FEDER) [DPI2015-65401-C3-2-R]; European Regional Development Fund","This research was funded by the UNIVERSIDAD DE LA SABANA, grant number ING-202-2018 and by COLCIENCIAS under scholarship grant 617-2-2014.

For this purpose, a multi-purpose friction/wear tester and a mechanical indenter with a diamond probe were used. The dental ceramics showed the lowest amount of wear depth (64 +/- 3.2 mu m) at 15 min cycle. There was an insignificant increase (p > 0.05) in the wear of ceramic in 15 min time interval, however the difference was significant (p < 0.05) while comparing at 30 min interval reaching to (99 +/- 4.4 mu m) at 150 min. Wear resulted in increase in the surface hardness of materials; ceramics (from 6.06 +/- 1.11 GPa to 6.65 +/- 1.12 GPa) and resin composites (from 1.44 +/- 0.31 GPa to 1.66 +/- 0.34 GPa) and significantly increase for alloys. For example, the hardness of CoCr was increased from 5.38 +/- 0.72 GPa to 7.18 +/- 0.75 GPa after wear. Dental ceramic remains the most wear resistant among tested materials. Among direct restorative materials, amalgam alloy has better wear resistance. Wear of dental alloys resulted in greater surface hardening compared to the direct restorative materials.","[Zafar, Muhammad Sohail] Taibah Univ, Dept Restorat Dent, Coll Dent, Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail] Riphah Int Univ, Islamic Int Dent Coll, Dept Dent Mat, Islamabad, Pakistan","Zafar, MS (reprint author), Taibah Univ, Dept Restorat Dent, Coll Dent, Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia.; Zafar, MS (reprint author), Riphah Int Univ, Islamic Int Dent Coll, Dept Dent Mat, Islamabad, Pakistan.",drsohail_78@hotmail.com,,,,,,29,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1066-7857,1753-5557,,MATER TECHNOL,Mater.

The generation of wear debris from any part of a prosthesis is unavoidable. This article will emphasize, with a careful morphological analysis, the interactions of different wear particles and biological host responses in periprosthetic tissue retrieved during revision arthroplasties due to aseptic loosening. Tissue samples for histological analysis were obtained during revision surgeries in the Valdoltra Orthopaedic hospital. Wear particles in the periprosthetic tissue were analysed according to their size, shape, colour and properties, observed by conventional light microscopy and under polarized light. Wear particles from polymers such as polyethylene and polymethylmetacrylate, metals and ceramics induce an extensive biological cascade of adverse cellular responses, in which macrophages are the main cellular type involved in the hostile inflammatory process. Histological analysis of the tissue obtained during implant revision surgery is considered important for wear-particle identification, and for the classification of biological reactions to wear particles. In view of the continuous development of new biomaterials, a standardised histological examination of periprosthetic tissue provides a useful tool for determining the cause of implant failure and for identifying wear particles by light-microscopy examination. It also provides a basis for the advanced analysis of implant wear, molecular gene expression and cytokine production.","[Coer, Andrej] Valdoltra Orthopaed Hosp, Jadranska 33, Jadranska 6280, Slovenia; [Coer, Andrej] Fac Hlth Sci, Polje 42, Izola 6130, Slovenia","Cor, A (reprint author), Valdoltra Orthopaed Hosp, Jadranska 33, Jadranska 6280, Slovenia.",andrej.coer@ob-valdoltra.si,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,INST ZA KOVINSKE MATERIALE I IN TEHNOLOGIE,LJUBJANA,"LEPI POT 11, LJUBJANA, 10000, SLOVENIA",1580-2949,1580-3414,,MATER TEHNOL,Mater.

In this study, three materials of the Ti-Nb and Ti-Nb-Fe systems were produced by powder metallurgy techniques starting from TiH2 (TH) powder. Several sintering cycles were employed to evaluate the H-2 elimination and the effect of sintering temperature on densification and fraction of beta-Ti phase. Also, the influence of alloying element size using two kinds of Fe powder was evaluated. The highest loss of H-2 was achieved by decreasing heating rate at the temperature range of hydride decomposition. SEM images and XRD results show mainly a beta-Ti phase for TH-40Nb and TH-5Fe-25Nb samples. The TH-12Nb sample shows (alpha + beta) microstructure. Fe addition with smaller particle size seems to improve the diffusion of Nb into Ti which promotes a higher beta-phase fraction and sample homogeneity.","[Chirico, C.; Tsipas, S.; Gordo, E.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencia & Ingn Mat & Ingn Quim, IAAB, Avda Univ 30, Leganes 28911, Spain; [Toptan, F.] Univ Mihno, CMEMS UMinho Ctr MicroElectroMech Syst, Azurem, Portugal","Chirico, C (reprint author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencia & Ingn Mat & Ingn Quim, IAAB, Avda Univ 30, Leganes 28911, Spain.",cchirico@ing.uc3m.es,,,"Regional Government of Madrid [S2013/MIT2862]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [PCIN-2016-123, RYC-2014-15014]","The authors would like to thank the funding provided for this research by the Regional Government of Madrid (programme MULTIMAT-CHALLENGE-CM, ref.

Herein, a starch-based biodegradable scaffold was fabricated by the freeze-drying method and cross-linked using a different concentration of 3-glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTMS). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) micrographs indicated an interconnected porous microstructure in which the porosity decreased as a function of starch and GPTMS content. Increasing the mechanical stability and decreasing absorption capacity and biodegradation ratio affected by the higher concentration of cross-linker and the changes in structure as a function of cross-linker enhancement. Moreover, the mineralization of hybrid structures in simulated body fluid was proved by FE-SEM image and X-ray diffraction analysis. Results indicated the more GPTMS in scaffolds led to more hydroxyapatite formation. The ability of the growth and proliferation of bone marrow mesenchyme stem cells on the constructs confirmed the ability of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications.

However, there are limited studies specifically comparing biofilm formation between commonly used metallic orthopaedic implant materials and different bacterial strains. This in vitro study is to evaluate the ability of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to adhere to and to form biofilms on the surface of five orthopaedic biomaterials, viz., cobalt and chromium, highly cross-linked polyethylene, stainless steel, trabecular metal, and titanium alloy. Materials and Methods: Bacterial adherence and bacterial biofilm-formation assays were performed by culturing S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. epidermidis ATCC 35984, E. coli ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 for 48 h on five different biomaterials. Quantitative bacterial adherence and biofilm formation were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope. Results: The highest level of adherence was observed on highly cross-linked polyethylene, followed by titanium, stainless steel, and trabecular metal, with the lowest occurring on the cobalt-chromium alloy. Among the bacterial strains tested, the ability for high adherence was observed with S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae followed by P. aeruginosa and E. coli, whereas S. aureus showed the least adherence. Conclusion: Cobalt-chromium was observed to have the lowest proclivity towards bacterial adherence compared to the other biomaterials tested. However, bacterial adhesion occurred with all the materials. Hence, it is necessary to further evaluate newer biomaterials that are resistant to bacterial adherence.","[Malhotra, Rajesh; Garg, Bhavuk; Shankar, Vivek] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed, New Delhi, India; [Dhawan, Benu] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, New Delhi 110029, India; [Nag, Tapas Chandra] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Anat, New Delhi, India","Dhawan, B (reprint author), All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, New Delhi 110029, India.",dhawanb@gmail.com,,,Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR); Zimmer Inc.,Financial support for this study was provided by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

A promising therapeutic approach is the use of osteoinductive materials, i.e. materials able to drive mesenchymal stem cells into the osteogenic lineage. Even though the mechanism of this so-called intrinsic osteoinduction or material-induced heterotopic ossification has been studied for decades, the process behind it remains unknown, thus preventing any design of highly potent osteoinductive materials. We propose and demonstrate for the first time that intrinsic osteoinduction is the result of calcium and/or phosphate depletion, thus explaining why not only the material (surface) composition but also the material volume and architecture (e.g. porosity, pore size) play a decisive role in this process.","[Bohner, Marc] RMS Fdn, Bischmattstr 12, CH-2544 Bettlach, Switzerland; [Miron, Richard J.] Univ Bern, Dept Periodontol, Bern, Switzerland","Bohner, M (reprint author), RMS Fdn, Bischmattstr 12, CH-2544 Bettlach, Switzerland.",marc.bohner@rms-foundation.ch,,,,,,162,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-7021,1873-4103,,MATER TODAY,Mater.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major pathogens in BAI. Current experimental BAI mammalian animal models such as mouse models are costly and time-consuming, and therefore not suitable for high throughput analysis. Thus, novel animal models as complementary systems for investigating BAI in vivo are desired. In the present study, we aimed to develop a zebrafish embryo model for in vivo visualization and intravital analysis of bacterial infection in the presence of biomaterials based on fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the provoked macrophage response was studied. To this end, we used fluorescent protein-expressing S. aureus and transgenic zebrafish embryos expressing fluorescent proteins in their macrophages and developed a procedure to inject bacteria alone or together with microspheres into the muscle tissue of embryos. To monitor bacterial infection progression in live embryos over time, we devised a simple but reliable method of microscopic scoring of fluorescent bacteria. The results from microscopic scoring showed that all embryos with more than 20 colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria yielded a positive fluorescent signal of bacteria. To study the potential effects of biomaterials on infection, we determined the CFU numbers of S. aureus with and without 10 mu m polystyrene microspheres (PS10) as model biomaterials in the embryos. Moreover, we used the ObjectJ project file ""Zebrafish-Immunotest"" operating in ImageJ to quantify the fluorescence intensity of S. aureus infection with and without PS10 over time. Results from both methods showed higher numbers of S. aureus in infected embryos with microspheres than in embryos without microspheres, indicating an increased infection susceptibility in the presence of the biomaterial. Thus, the present study shows the potential of the zebrafish embryo model to study BAI with the methods developed here.","[Zhang, Xiaolin; de Boer, Leonie; Stockhammer, Oliver W.; Zaat, Sebastian A.

In this study, four types of samples including pepsin soluble collagen sponge (PCS), acid soluble collagen sponge (ACS), bovine collagen electrospun I (BCE I) and bovine collagen electrospun II (BCE II) were used as wound dressing materials. We showed that the PCS, ACS, BCE I and BCE II treated rats increased the percentage of wound contraction, reduced the inflammatory infiltration, and accelerated the epithelization and healing. PCS, ACS, BCE I, and BCE II significantly enhanced the total protein and hydroxyproline level in rats. ACS could induce more fibroblasts proliferation and differentiation than PCS, however, both PCS and ACS had a lower effect than BCE I and BCE II. PCS, ACS, BCE I, and BCE II could regulate deposition of collagen, which led to excellent alignment in the wound healing process. There were similar effects on inducing the level of cytokines including EGF, FGF, and vascular endothelial marker CD31 among these four groups.

By-products of the fishing industry are rich sources of collagen, which can be used as an alternative to collagen traditionally harvested from land mammals. However, commercial applications of fish-based collagen are limited by the low efficiency, low productivity, and low sustainability of the extraction process. This study applied a new technique (electrodialysis) for the extraction of Takifugu flavidus skin collagen. We found electrodialysis to have better economic and environmental outcomes than traditional dialysis as it significantly reduced the purification time and wastewater (95%) while maintaining high extraction yield (67.3 +/- 1.3 g/100 g dry weight, p < 0.05). SDS-PAGE, amino acid composition analysis, and spectrophotometric characterization indicated that electrodialysis treatment retained the physicochemical properties of T. flavidus collagen. Heavy metals and tetrodotoxin analyses indicated the safety of T. flavidus collagen. Notably, the collagen had similar thermal stability to calf skin collagen, with the maximum transition temperature and denaturation temperature of 41.8 +/- 0.35 and 28.4 +/- 2.5 degrees C, respectively. All evidence suggests that electrodialysis is a promising technique for extracting collagen in the fishing industry and that T. flavidus skin collagen could serve as an alternative source of collagen to meet the increasing demand from consumers.","[Chen, Junde; Yi, Ruizao; Bai, Kaikai; Wang, Guangyu; Tan, Ran; Sun, Shanshan; Xu, Nuohua] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 3, Marine Biol Resource Comprehens Utilizat Engn Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Li, Min] North Carolina State Univ, Plants Human Hlth Inst, Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA","Chen, JD (reprint author), State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 3, Marine Biol Resource Comprehens Utilizat Engn Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.; Li, M (reprint author), North Carolina State Univ, Plants Human Hlth Inst, Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA.",jdchen@tio.org.cn; mli33@ncsu.edu; yiruizao@163.com; kkbai@tio.org.cn; 17859733637@163.com; tanran@tio.org.cn; shshsun123@163.com; xunuohua@163.com,,"Li, Min/0000-0002-9651-1301","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41676129, 41106149]; Scientific Research Foundation of the Third Institute of Oceanography, SOA [2016007]","This work was gratefully supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41676129 & 41106149), and the Scientific Research Foundation of the Third Institute of Oceanography, SOA (2016007).",,51,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1660-3397,,,MAR DRUGS,Mar.

The present study aims to design and produce drug-eluting core-shell fibrous scaffolds for wound healing and skin tissue engineering. Aloe vera extracts were encapsulated inside polymer fibers containing chitosan, polycaprolactone, and keratin using the co-axial electrospinning technique. Electron microscopic studies show that continuous and uniform fibers with an average diameter of 209 +/- 47 nm were successfully fabricated. The fibers have a core-shell structure with a shell thickness of about 90 nm, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. By employing Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, the characteristic peaks of Aloe vera were detected, which indicate successful incorporation of this natural herb into the polymeric fibers.

The complex physiological barriers of the eye contribute to the difficulty in developing novel therapies by limiting our ability to deliver therapeutics in a sustained and controlled manner; especially when attempting to deliver drugs to the posterior eye or trying to regenerate the diseased retina. Cell-based therapies offer a significant potential advancement in these situations. In particular, encapsulating, or immunoisolating, cells within implantable, semi-permeable membranes has emerged as a clinically viable means of delivering therapeutic molecules to the eye for indefinite periods of time. The optimization of encapsulation device designs is occurring together with refinements in biomaterials, genetic engineering, and stem-cell production, yielding, for the first time, the possibility of widespread therapeutic use of this technology. Here, we highlight the status of the most advanced and widely explored iteration of cell encapsulation with an eye toward translating the potential of this technological approach to the medical reality.","[Orive, Gorka; Santos-Vizcaino, Edorta; Luis Pedraz, Jose; Maria Hernandez, Rosa] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Sch Pharm, NanoBioCel Grp,Lab Pharmaceut, Paseo Univ 7, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Orive, Gorka; Santos-Vizcaino, Edorta; Luis Pedraz, Jose; Maria Hernandez, Rosa] Biomed Res Networking Ctr Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Vitoria, Spain; [Orive, Gorka] Univ Basque Country, Univ Inst Regenerat Med & Oral Implantol UIRMI, Fdn Eduardo Anitua, Vitoria, Spain; [Orive, Gorka] Singapore Eye Res Inst, 20 Coll Rd,Discovery Tower, Singapore, Singapore; [Vela Ramirez, Julia E.; Peppas, Nicholas A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Biomed Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Vela Ramirez, Julia E.; Peppas, Nicholas A.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Biomat Drug Delivery & Regenerat Med, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dolatshahi-Pirouz, Alireza] Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Nanomed & Theranost, Dept Micro & Nanotechnol, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Henry Samueli Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, C MIT, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif NanoSyst Inst CNSI, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Peppas, Nicholas A.] Univ Texas Austin, McKetta Dept Chem Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Peppas, Nicholas A.] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Div Pharmaceut, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Emerich, Dwaine F.] Gloriana Therapeut Inc, 225 Chapman St, Providence, RI USA","Orive, G (reprint author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Sch Pharm, NanoBioCel Grp,Lab Pharmaceut, Paseo Univ 7, Vitoria 01006, Spain.; Emerich, DF (reprint author), NsGene Inc, 225 Chapman St, Providence, RI 02905 USA.",gorka.orive@ehu.eus; DFE@GlorianaTx.com,,"Khademhosseini, Ali/0000-0002-2692-1524; SANTOS VIZCAINO, EDORTA/0000-0001-7064-4563; Dolatshahi-Pirouz, Alireza/0000-0001-6326-0836","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [SAF2016-76150-R]; Basque Country Government [PRGF 3.0 ELKARTEK KK-2017/00063, IT907-16]","The authors wish to thank projects SAF2016-76150-R from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and PRGF 3.0 ELKARTEK KK-2017/00063 from the Basque Country Government and intellectual and technical assistance from the ICTS ""NANBIOSIS"", more specifically by the Drug Formulation Unit (U10) of the GIBER in Bioengineering, Biomaterials & Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN) at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU).

By the current advances in the spinal surgery, an understanding of the precise biological mechanism of each bone graft substitute is mandatory for upholding the induction of solid spinal fusion. Objective: The aim of the present review is to critically discuss various surgical implications and level of evidence of most commonly employed bone graft substitutes for spinal fusion. Method: Data was collected via electronic search using ""PubMed"", ""SciFinder"", ""ScienceDirect"", ""Google Scholar"", ""Web of Science"" and a library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and e-books. Results: Despite having exceptional inherent osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive features, clinical acceptability of autografts (patient's own bone) is limited due to several perioperative and postoperative complications i.e., donor-site morbidities and limited graft supply. Alternatively, allografts (bone harvested from cadaver) have shown great promise in achieving acceptable bone fusion rate while alleviating the donor-site morbidities associated with implantation of autografts. As an adjuvant to allograft, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has shown remarkable efficacy of bone fusion, when employed as graft extender or graft enhancer. Recent advances in recombinant technologies have made it possible to implant growth and differentiation factors (bone morphogenetic proteins) for spinal fusion. Conclusion: Selection of a particular bone grafting biotherapy can be rationalized based on the level of spine fusion, clinical experience and preference of orthopaedic surgeon, and prevalence of donor-site morbidities.","[Li, Guanbao; Li, Pinquan; Chen, Qiuan] Yulin City Orthopaed Hosp Tradit Chinese Med & We, Dept Minimally Invas Spine Surg, 597,Jiaoyu Rd, Yulin 537000, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Thu, Hnin Ei] Lincoln Univ Coll, Dept Pharmacol & Dent Therapeut, Fac Dent, Jalan Stadium,SS 7-15,Kelana Jaya, Petaling Jaya 47301, Selangor, Malaysia; [Hussain, Zahid] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Dept Pharmaceut, Fac Pharm, Puncak Alam Campus, Bandar Puncak Alam 42300, Selangor, Malaysia","Li, GB (reprint author), Yulin City Orthopaed Hosp Tradit Chinese Med & We, Dept Minimally Invas Spine Surg, 597,Jiaoyu Rd, Yulin 537000, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",liguanbao888@126.com; zahidh85@yahoo.com,,,Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) [600-IRMI/DANA 5/3/LESTARI (0007/2016)],"Authors would like to acknowledge ""Institute of Research Management & Innovation (IRMI)"".

Biochar is first prepared by dry distillation of the seed coats, and then is transformed into porous carbon by KOH activation. The regulation of activation temperatures and ratios of activator is studied. The optimized condition is activation temperature of 750 degrees C, and the ratio of biochar to activator is 1:3. HRTEM, X-ray diffraction and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods were used to characterize the samples. The porous carbon prepared under the optimum condition has a specific surface area of 2148 m(2) g(-1) with a large amount of micropores of about 0.5 nm-2 nm closely and orderly distributed, together with a certain number of mesporous (similar to 12% of the total specific surface area), such a unique structure provides both a large storage space for electrons and a channel for them to passage quickly. Due to this unique architecture, the specific capacitance of the porous carbon is as high as 421 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with a moderate rate capability (259 F/g at 10 A/g), and good cycle stability (90.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g), suggesting it one of the ideal materials for the development of supercapacitors. Symmetrical supercapacitor based on this material has also been assembled and tested to further verify the actual capacitance properties. The specific capacitance of the symmetrical supercapacitor is 276 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and 50 F/g was achieved when the current density was raised up to 10 A/g. Under the current density of 10 A/g, the capacitance only decreased slightly after the circulation of 5000 cycles, and the retention rate reached 86%, illustrates the practical application potential of this material.","[Zhang, Yan-Lei; Li, Shi-Ying; Tang, Zhi-Shu; Song, Zhong-xing; Sun, Jing] Shaanxi Univ Chinese Med, Shaanxi Collaborat Innovat Ctr Ind Tradit Chinese, Xianyang 712083, Peoples R China","Zhang, YL (reprint author), Shaanxi Univ Chinese Med, Shaanxi Collaborat Innovat Ctr Ind Tradit Chinese, Xianyang 712083, Peoples R China.",nwuzyl@163.com,,,Shaanxi Provincial Key Industries Innovation Chain Project [2018ZDCXL-SF-01-06]; Shaanxi Provincial Innovation Talent Promotion Program-Science and Technology Innovation Team Project [2018 TD-005],We thank the finical support from Shaanxi Provincial Key Industries Innovation Chain Project (2018ZDCXL-SF-01-06) and the Shaanxi Provincial Innovation Talent Promotion Program-Science and Technology Innovation Team Project (2018 TD-005).

Intensive research on osteoimmunomodulation has shown that the surfaces of implants should possess favorable osteoimmunomodulation to facilitate osteogenesis. Methods: A novel, green and efficient phase-transited lysozyme (PTL) technique was used to prime titanium discs with a positive charge. In addition, sodium hyaluronate (HA) and self-assembled type I collagen containing aspirin (ASA) nanoparticles were decorated on PTL-primed Ti discs via electrostatic interaction. Results: The behaviors of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on the Ti disc surfaces containing ASA were analyzed in different conditioned media (CM) generated by macrophages. Additionally, the secretion of inflammation-related cytokines of macrophages on the surfaces of different Ti discs was investigated in in vitro experiments, which showed that the Ti surface containing ASA not only supported the migration, proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs but also reduced the inflammatory response of macrophages compared with Ti discs without surface modification. After implantation in vivo, the ASA-modified implant can significantly contribute to bone formation around the implant, which mirrors the evaluation in vitro. Conclusion: This study highlights the significant effects of appropriate surface characteristics on the regulation of osteogenesis and osteoimmunomodulation around an implant. Implant modification with ASA potentially provides superior strategies for the surface modification of biomaterials.","[Zhang, Wenxin; Lu, Xin; Shen, Minjuan; Song, Yunjia; Liu, Huanhuan; Deng, Jingjing; Zhong, Xue; Zhang, Xu] Tianjin Med Univ, Sch Dent, Stomatol Hosp, 12 Observ Rd, Tianjin 300070, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Zuoying] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Lab Biomed Mat, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, X (reprint author), Tianjin Med Univ, Sch Dent, Stomatol Hosp, 12 Observ Rd, Tianjin 300070, Peoples R China.",zhangxu@tmu.edu.cn,,,Scientific Research Fund of Tianjin Medical University [2016KYZQ07],This study was supported by a grant from Scientific Research Fund of Tianjin Medical University (No 2016KYZQ07).

When engineered tissues are scaled up to therapeutically relevant dimensions, their demand of oxygen and nutrients can no longer be met by diffusion. Thus, there is a need for perfusable vascular structures. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) act as transcriptional oxygen sensors and regulate a multitude of genes involved in adaptive processes to hypoxia, including angiogenesis. Thus, targeting HIFs is a promising strategy to induce vascularization of engineered tissues.Areas covered: Here we review current vascularization strategies and summarize the present knowledge regarding activation of HIF signaling by ions, iron chelating agents, -Ketoglutarate (KG) analogues, and the lipid-lowering drug simvastatin to induce angiogenesis. Specifically, we focus on the incorporation of HIF-activating agents into biomaterials and scaffolds for controlled release.Expert opinion: Vascularization of tissue constructs through activation of upstream regulators of angiogenesis offers advantages but also suffers from drawbacks. HIFs can induce a complete angiogenic program; however, this program appears to be too slow to vascularize larger constructs before cell death occurs. It is therefore crucial that HIF-activation is combined with cell protective strategies and prevascularization techniques to obtain fully vascularized, vital tissues of therapeutically relevant dimensions.","[Esser, Tilman U.; Roshanbinfar, Kaveh; Engel, Felix B.] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Inst Pathol, Dept Nephropathol, Expt Renal & Cardiovasc Res, Erlangen, Germany","Engel, FB (reprint author), Univ Klinikum Erlangen, Dept Nephropathol, Schwabachanlage 12 TRC, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",felix.engel@uk-erlangen.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [326998133 - TRR 225, EN453/11-1]","Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Projektnummer 326998133 - TRR 225 (subproject C01 to FB Engel) and an individual grant (EN453/11-1 to FB Engel).",,147,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1471-2598,1744-7682,,EXPERT OPIN BIOL TH,Expert Opin.

The porous scaffolds were prepared from the silk fibroin solutions 4%, 5%, 6%, 7% and 8.4% weight per volume (w/v) by freeze drying which produced scaffolds with the minimal changes in the pore size (96-160 mu m) but with a approximate to 8-fold range of modulus (16 -131 kPa) in the wet condition. After isolation and characterization, stem cells of the apical papilla (SCAP) were seeded on the scaffolds and the osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by alizerin red staining, alkaline phosphatase test, real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated modulus-dependent osteogenic differentiation of the apical papilla stem cells from 4% w/v (16 kPa) to 7% w/v (83 kPa) and then a sudden decrease of differentiation was observed in the 8.4% w/v (131 kPa). The highest differentiation was happened in the 7 % w/v (83 kPa). The stem cells can respond to elasticity ranged from 0.1 to 100 kPa and then differentiate into different lineages in terms of the amount of elastic modulus. This is probably the reason why bone differentiation potential of the SCAP decreases in the modulus over 100 kPa.","[Shariatzadeh, Seyed Mohammad Ali; Mehranjani, Malek Soleimani] Arak Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Arak, Iran; [Amirikia, Mehdi; Jorsaraei, Seyed Gholam Ali] Babol Univ Med Sci, Hlth Res Inst, Fatemeh Zahra Infertil & Reprod Hlth Res Ctr, Bobol, Iran","Shariatzadeh, SMA (reprint author), Arak Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Arak, Iran.",s-shariatzadeh@araku.ac.ir,,,,,,49,0,0,1,1,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",1045-1056,1095-8320,,BIOLOGICALS,Biologicals,JAN,2019,57,,,,,,1.0,8,,10.1016/j.biologicals.2018.10.005,,,,8,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HJ9IZ,WOS:000457513400001,30391340.0,,,,2019-02-25

It was found that the AO surface displayed moderately higher surface roughness and obviously increased wettability, compared to the original Ti surface. In vitro cellular activity tests demonstrated that osteoblast cells cultured on the AO surface exhibited a much well-spread cytoskeleton organization with more stretched actin filaments, compared to those cultured on the Ti surface. The adherent cell number was also higher on the AO surface than the pure Ti substrate. In addition, we explore the molecular basis of mechanism by analyzing gene expression levels of adhesion and osteogenesis-related genes in MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on different surfaces using quantitative real-time PCR. Increased mRNA levels of vinculin, collagen type I, osteopontin and osteocalcin were found on the AO surface, compared with the control group. Furthermore, in vivo animal experiment using a rat model revealed that anodized implant surface promotes osseointegration and demonstrated higher bone bonding strength compared to the pure Ti substrate. Our study revealed the superior cell adhesion property, increased adherent and osteogenesis-related gene expressions and enhanced osseointegration by anodized surface, thus implying its enlarged application in future.","[Li, Ying; You, Yapeng; Song, Yunjia; Ma, Aobo; Chen, Bo; Han, Wen; Li, Changyi] Tianjin Med Univ, Stomatol Hosp, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Li, Baoe] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Li, Y (reprint author), Tianjin Med Univ, Dept Prosthodont, Stomatol Hosp, Tianjin 300070, Peoples R China.",yingli@tmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81500886, 31470920, 81870809]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City of China [16JCYBJC28700]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China [E2017202032]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81500886, 31470920, 81870809); the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City of China (16JCYBJC28700); and Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China (E2017202032).",,39,0,0,0,0,JOURNAL HARD TISSUE BIOLOGY,MINATO KU,"NIHON GAKUKUTSU KYORYOKU ZAIDAN, 3- 24- 20, NISHIAZABU, MINATO KU, TOKYO 106-0031, JAPAN",1341-7649,,,J HARD TISSUE BIOL,J.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of macrophages. We investigated the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (1L-4) from mouse macrophages (RAW264.7) activated by GM-CSF. RAW264.7 cells were cultured on titanium (Ti) discs. Secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-4 was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 24 h and 48 h. Cell morphologies were observed using SEM, and cell viability was accessed by an MTT assay. GM-CSF caused rough and irregular surface morphology on the macrophages and resulted in a significant difference in cell viability after 48 h (p<0.05). TNF- a secretion significantly decreased after 48 h without GM-CSF compared with that at 24 (r0.05). GM-CSF significantly increased the secretion of TNF-alpha after 24 It and 48 h (p<0.05). IL-4 secretion was significantly different with or without GM-CSF stimulation at 24 h and 48 h (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in 1L-4 secretion 24 h and 48 h after GM-CSF stimulation (p<0.05). These results suggest that macrophage stimulated GM-CSF may promote secretion of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines on Ti.","[Suzuki, Takuma; Gomi, Kazuhiro] Tsurumi Univ, Sch Dent Med, Dept Periodontol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Hayakawa, Tohru] Tsurumi Univ, Sch Dent Med, Dept Dent Engn, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Suzuki, T (reprint author), Tsurumi Univ, Sch Dent Med, Dept Periodontol, Tsurumi Ku, 2-1-3 Tsurumi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2308501, Japan.",suzuki-takuma@tsurumi-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K20546],This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (16K20546) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.,,32,0,0,0,0,JOURNAL HARD TISSUE BIOLOGY,MINATO KU,"NIHON GAKUKUTSU KYORYOKU ZAIDAN, 3- 24- 20, NISHIAZABU, MINATO KU, TOKYO 106-0031, JAPAN",1341-7649,,,J HARD TISSUE BIOL,J.

Firstly, brominated poly(butylene succinate) (BPBS) was prepared by addition of bromine to carbon carbon double bonds on the backbone of poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene fumarate) (PBSF). Then, the quaternization of BPBS with series of N,N-dimethyl alkylamines afforded poly(butylene succinate) containing quaternary ammonium cations (QPBS) with various ion contents and alkyl chain lengths. The structures of BPBS and QPBS were systematically characterized by NMR, ATR-FTIR, GPC and XPS. The hydrophilicity and the antibacterial activity have been studied by water contact angle (WCA), inhibition zone method, optical density method and scanning electron microscope (SEM). WCA test indicates that the hydrophilicity of polyester is greatly improved after the introduction of quaternary ammonium cations. The antibacterial study reveals that cationic copolyesters exhibited excellent antibacterial performance for both S. maws and E. coil when the alkyl chain length was greater than 8, as compared with the ion content and alkyl chain length is a more important factor for the antibacterial performance. Considering the biodegradation, good antibacterial activities and simple process, this kind of material may have great potential to be applied as biomaterials.","[Yan, Jia; Hu, Kun; Li, Luhai; Wu, Shaohua] Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Inst Printing & Packaging Engn, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jia; Zheng, Liuchun; Li, Chuncheng; Xiao, Yaonan; Wu, Shaohua; Liu, Jiajian; Zhang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci ICCAS, Inst Chem, Key Lab Engn Plast, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Hu, Kun] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Engn, Fuzhou 350116, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Li; Wang, Hengliang] Beijing Inst Biotechnol, State Key Lab Pathogen & Biosecur, Beijing 100071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan] Fuzhou Med Assoc, Hosp 1, Fuzhou 350009, Fujian, Peoples R China","Zheng, LC; Hu, K; Li, CC (reprint author), Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Inst Printing & Packaging Engn, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China.",hubeizlc@iccas.ac.cn; kunhu@139.com; lichch@iccas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation [21574137, 21104087, 51373186]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFB1100800]; Science and Technology Major Project Foundation of Fujian Province [2015YZ0003]; University Scientific Research Project of 3D Printing Mineralized Collagen-based Child Mandible [20190116002/037]","Financial support from National Natural Science Foundation (Grant Nos. 21574137, 21104087, 51373186), National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFB1100800), Science and Technology Major Project Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2015YZ0003) and University Scientific Research Project of 3D Printing Mineralized Collagen-based Child Mandible (Grant No. 20190116002/037) are gratefully acknowledged.",,50,0,0,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0014-3057,1873-1945,,EUR POLYM J,Eur.

Nevertheless, the direct, precise and nondestructive observation of the ordering process, which is especially critical for evaluating the quality of consecutive manufacturing, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce Mueller matrix ellipso-metry (MME) as a nondestructive method to quantitatively investigate the nanocomposite ordering process upon holography. This nondestructive investigation directly offers the exact width of, refractive index and nano particle fraction in each bright (constructive) and dark (destructive) interference area, which is impossible to be implemented using other existing techniques. Interestingly, the width of dark regions in the formed holographic gratings is observed to decrease while the width of bright regions increases with an augmentation of holographic recording time, distinct from previous width-equal assumption. Meanwhile, an apparent diffusion coefficient of 2 x 10(-15) m(2) s(-1) for nanoparticles is determined on the basis of time dependent grating parameter variation, which is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the initial value theoretically predicted by the Stokes-Einstein diffusion equation. The distinct diffusion coefficient is attributed to the rapid increase of viscosity driven by polymerization during holography. No depolarization is observed in these holographic polymer nanocomposites, indicating uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer matrices. The proposed protocol herein is envisioned to pave the way for precisely and nondestructively understanding the formation of ordered structure in electronics, photonics, photovoltaics, biomaterials and other disciplines.","[Jiang, Hao; Gu, Honggang; Chen, Xiuguo; Liu, Shiyuan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Peng, Haiyan; Chen, Guannan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Mat Chem Energy Convers & Storage, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liao, Yonggui; Xie, Xiaolin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Proc & Die & Mold Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Liu, SY (reprint author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Peng, HY (reprint author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Mat Chem Energy Convers & Storage, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Liao, YG (reprint author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Proc & Die & Mold Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",hypeng@hust.edu.cn; ygliao@hust.edu.cn; shyliu@hust.edu.cn,,"Jiang, Hao/0000-0003-0561-5058","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51525502, 51433002, 51575214, 51503045]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China [2018CFA057]","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51525502, 51433002, 51575214 and 51503045) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China (2018CFA057).",,33,0,0,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0014-3057,1873-1945,,EUR POLYM J,Eur.

In-line extrusion of biodegradable polyester elastomers and their composites would open new possibilities for high-precision manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing), solvent-free additive dispersion, and adhesion development for future clinical needs. An effective method to extrude elastomeric, conductive composites is demonstrated for the first time with polyoctanediol citrate/sebacate (POCS) as the bioelastomer. The POCS pre-polymer in its liquid form was blended with untreated multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and partially cured to produce the feedstock for twin-screw hot-melt extrusion. MWCNTs were mechanically sheered within the POCS matrix at a processing temperature of 120 degrees C, which thermocured from a viscoelastic liquid into an extrudable crosslinked composite rubber. Furthermore, the composite was thermally and electrically conductive with swelling and hydrolytic degradation kinetic properties dependent on MWCNT concentration. Extruded composite strings are classified as conductive polymers, with lowest resistivity of 3.5 k Omega cm measured for POCS-MWCNT-5% in comparison to POCS-MWCNT-1% at 22.7 k Omega cm. Extruded strings (similar to 2 man in diameter) exhibit a tensile modulus of 5-7.5 MPa with an extensibility of 40-80%.

This is especially valid for the nanotribological characteristics of poly (2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOXA) brushes, assembled on titanium oxide surfaces by grafting-to technique. At low surface coverage, cyclic PEOXA (C-PEOXA) grafts flatten down towards the grafting surface and provide high friction when sheared against an identical countersurface. In contrast, densely grafted C-PEOXA assemblies stretch vertically forming a molecularly smooth surface that hinders interpenetration with the opposing brush, and dramatically reduces friction, greatly surpassing the lubricious properties typically attained by applying linear grafts. Differently from their nanotribological properties, C-PEOXA brushes always show improved resistance towards the adsorption of proteins if compared to their linear counterparts, irrespective of their grafting density. The enhancement in biopassivity achieved by applying cyclic PEOXAs is ascribed to their intrinsic tendency to hinder protein penetration within a brush layer.","[Divandari, Mohammad; Morgese, Giulia; Ramakrishna, Shivaprakash N.; Benetti, Edmondo M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, Lab Surface Sci & Technol, Polymer Surfaces Grp, Zurich, Switzerland","Ramakrishna, SN; Benetti, EM (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, Lab Surface Sci & Technol, Polymer Surfaces Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",shivaprakash.ramakrishna@mat.ethz.ch; edmondo.benetti@mat.ethz.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [PZ00P2 - 790 148156],"We thank Prof. Nicholas D.

Materials and methods: First, three different nHAp/GNR (1, 2, and 3 wt% of GNR) were produced and characterized. For in vivo analyses, 36 Wistar rats (var. albinus, weighing 250-300 g, Comissao de Etica no Uso de Animais [CEUA] n.002/17) were used. Prior to implantation, osteoporosis was induced by oophorectomy in female rats. After 45 days, a tibial fracture was inflicted using a 3.0-mm Quest trephine drill. Then, the animals were separated into six sample groups at two different time periods of 21 and 45 days. The lesions were filled with 3 mg of one of the above samples using a curette. After 21 or 45 days of implantation, the animals were euthanized for analysis. Histological, biochemical, and radiographic analyses (DIGORA method) were performed. The data were evaluated through ANOVA, Tukey test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with statistical significance at P<0.05. Results: Both nHAp and GNR exhibited osteoconductive activity. However, the nHAp/GNR exhibited regenerative activity proportional to their concentration, following the order of 3%>2%>1% wt. Conclusion: Therefore, it can be inferred that all analyzed nanoparticles promoted bone regeneration in osteoporotic rats independent of analyzed time.","[Oliveira, Francilio Carvalho; Carvalho, Jancineide Oliveira; Viana, Bartolomeu Cruz; Lobo, Anderson Oliveira] Brasil Univ, Inst Sci & Technol, BR-08230030 Itaquera, SP, Brazil; [Oliveira, Francilio Carvalho; Carvalho, Jancineide Oliveira; Goncalves, licia de Sousa; Pereira Freitas, Sergio Antonio] Univ Ctr Hlth Humanities & Technol Piaui, UNINOVAFAPI, Teresina, Piaui, Brazil; [Soares Gusmao, Suziete Batista; de Meira Gusmao, Gustavo Oliveira; Lobo, Anderson Oliveira] UFPI Fed Univ Piaui, Technol Ctr, LIMAV Interdisciplinary Lab Adv Mat, Mat Sci & Engn Grad Program, BR-64049550 Teresina, Piaui, Brazil; [Soares Mendes, Liana Martha] Univ Fed Piaui, Dept Specialized Med, BR-64017775 Teresina, Piaui, Brazil; [de Meira Gusmao, Gustavo Oliveira] Univ Estadual Piaui, Dept Phys, BR-64002150 Teresina, Piaui, Brazil; [Viana, Bartolomeu Cruz] Univ Fed Piaui, Dept Phys, BR-64049550 Teresina, Brazil; [Marciano, Fernanda Roberta] Northeastern Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Nanomed Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Marciano, Fernanda Roberta; Lobo, Anderson Oliveira] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lobo, AO (reprint author), UFPI Fed Univ Piaui, LIMAV Interdisciplinary Lab Adv Mat, Mat Sci & Engn Grad Program, BR-64049550 Teresina, PI, Brazil.",lobo@ufpi.edu.br,,"Viana, Bartolomeu/0000-0002-5207-4269; Lobo, Anderson/0000-0002-2544-0438","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [303752/2017-3, 304133/2017-5]; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [88881.120138/2016-01, 88881.120221/2016-01]; Universidade Brasil","AOL and FRM thank the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq grants numbers AOL#303752/2017-3 and FRM#304133/2017-5), Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES, grant numbers AOL#88881.120138/2016-01 and FRM#88881.120221/2016-01), and Universidade Brasil for the scholarships.",,38,0,0,0,0,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1178-2013,,,INT J NANOMED,Int.

Here we manufactured 1.5 mm poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) grafts modified by distinct linear or cyclic RGD peptides immobilized by short or long amine linker arms. Modified vascular prostheses were tested in vitro to assess their mechanical properties, hemocompatibility, thrombogenicity and endothelialisation. We also implanted these grafts into rat abdominal aortas with the following histological examination at 1 and 3 months to evaluate their primary patency, cellular composition and detect possible calcification. Our results demonstrated that all modes of RGD modification reduce ultimate tensile strength of the grafts. Modification of prostheses does not cause haemolysis upon the contact with modified grafts, yet all the RGD-treated grafts display a tendency to promote platelet aggregation in comparison with unmodified counterparts. In vivo findings identify that cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys peptide in combination with trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine linker group substantially improve graft biocompatibility. To conclude, here we for the first time compared synthetic small-diameter vascular prostheses with different modes of RGD modification.

A specific crosslinking/copolymerization chemistry was used to construct hydrogels with a controlled network organization. The hydrogels were prepared using 3,6-anhydro--l-galacto--d-galactan (galactose hydrogel) together with resveratrol (trans-3,5,4-trihydroxystilbene) and calcium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The resveratrol was introduced in three different concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM. Nanosized calcium hydroxyapatite was synthesized by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal technique, annealed at 500 degrees C for 3 h, and introduced at a concentration 10% (m/v). The morphology and structural properties of Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2) and its composite were determined by using XRPD (X-ray powder diffraction) techniques, as well as the absorption and IR (infrared) spectroscopy. The average nanoparticle size was 35 nm. The water affinity, morphology, organic compound release profile, and cytocompatibility of the obtained materials were studied in detail. The designed hydrogels were shown to be materials of biological relevance and of great pharmacological potential as carriers for bioactive compound delivery. Their cytocompatibility was tested using a model of human multipotent stromal cells isolated from adipose tissue (hASCs). The biomaterials increased the proliferative activity and viability of hASCs, as well as reduced markers of oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, it has been thought that the designed materials meet the requirements of the tissue engineering triad, and may find application in regenerative medicine, especially for personalized therapies.","[Marycz, Krzysztof; Smieszek, Agnieszka; Trynda, Justyna] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Biol & Anim Sci, Dept Expt Biol, Ul Norwida 27B, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [Marycz, Krzysztof] Justus Liebig Univ, Equine Clin Equine Surg, Fac Vet Med, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Sobierajska, Paulina; Targonska, Sara; Grosman, Lukasz; Wiglusz, Rafal J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Low Temp & Struct Res, Okolna 2, PL-50422 Wroclaw, Poland; [Wiglusz, Rafal J.] Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Adv Mat & Smart Struct, Okolna 2, PL-50950 Wroclaw, Poland","Marycz, K (reprint author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Biol & Anim Sci, Dept Expt Biol, Ul Norwida 27B, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland.; Marycz, K (reprint author), Justus Liebig Univ, Equine Clin Equine Surg, Fac Vet Med, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",krzysztof.marycz@upwr.edu.pl; agnieszka.smieszek@upwr.edu.pl; justyna.trynda@upwr.edu.pl; p.sobierajska@intibs.pl; s.targonska@intibs.pl; l.grosman@hasco-lek.pl; r.wiglusz@intibs.pl,,,"National Science Centre in Poland [2017/26/M/NZ5/01184, UMO-2015/19/B/ST5/01330]; National Science Center Poland [UMO-2018/28/T/ST5/00326]","This project is financed in the framework of grants entitled ""Preparation and characterization of biocomposites based on nanoapatites for theranostics"" (Grant No. UMO-2015/19/B/ST5/01330) as well as ""New, two-stage scaffolds based on calcium nanoapatite (nHAP) incorporated with iron nanotoxides (Fe<INF>2</INF>O<INF>3</INF>/Fe<INF>3</INF>O<INF>4</INF>) with the function of controlled release of miRNA in a static magnetic field for the regeneration of bone fractures in osteoporotic patients"" (Grant No. UMO 2017/26/M/NZ5/01184) financed by The National Science Centre in Poland.

To this end, maltose- and lactose-substituted vinyl ethers (MalVE and LacVE, respectively) and maltose-substituted maleimide (MalMI) were newly synthesized. RAFT copolymerization of MalVE and ethyl maleimide (EtMI) (monomer feed ratio: MalVE:EtMI = 1:1) afforded periodic glycopolymers (poly(MalVE-co-EtMI)) consisting of major parts of alternating structure (-(MalVE-EtMI)(n)-) and a small part of consecutive sequences of EtMI (-EtMI-EtMI-). Occurrence of the latter sequences was caused by the homopolymerizability of maleimide under the present polymerization condition, and the formation of the consecutive sequences of EtMI was successfully suppressed by varying the monomer feed ratio. RAFT copolymerization of LacVE and EtMI was also found to proceed and similarly yielded periodic glycopolymers (poly(LacVE-co-EtMI)). Moreover, RAFT copolymerization of LacVE and MalMI (monomer feed ratio: LacVE:MalMI = 1:1) was performed to give copolymers (poly(LacVE-co-MalMI)) having composition ratio of LacVE/MalMI approximate to 36/64. The resultant periodic glycopolymers poly(MalVE-co-EtMI) and poly(LacVE-co-EtMI) were subjected to lectin binding assay using concanavalin A and peanut agglutinin, exhibiting the glycocluster effect.

This article describes biological and physiochemical aspects concerning a new polymeric middle ear implant (Otoimplant) enriched with silver nanoparticles. This kind of prosthesis is a promising implant for the reconstruction of ossicles in ossiculoplasty. We found that incorporation of silver nanoparticles into a polymeric matrix resulted in bactericidal efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both resistant to antibiotics and basic strains. Our prostheses do not show cytotoxic effect and are a suitable biomaterial platform for effective culture of Saos2 and NHOst osteoblastic cells. The in vitro incubation of the samples in distilled water revealed that surface parameters, such as roughness, may slightly increase as a result of unveiling nanoparticles. However, the prolonged immersion does not change mechanical parameters.

The gold standard for surgical bone repair is autografting, which enjoys excellent clinical outcomes; however, it possesses significant drawbacks including donor site morbidity and limited availability. Although collagen sponges delivered with bone morphogenetic protein, type 2 (BMP2) are a common alternative or supplement, they do not efficiently retain BMP2, necessitating extremely high doses to elicit bone formation. Hence, reports of BMP2 complications are rising, including cancer promotion and ectopic bone formation, the latter inducing complications such as breathing difficulties and neurologic impairments. Thus, efforts to exert spatial control over bone formation are increasing. Several tissue engineering approaches have demonstrated the potential for targeted and controlled bone formation. These approaches include biomaterial scaffolds derived from synthetic sources, e.g., calcium phosphates or polymers; natural sources, e.g., bone or seashell; and immobilized biofactors, e.g., BMP2. Although BMP2 is the only protein clinically approved for use in a surgical device, there are several proteins, small molecules, and growth factors that show promise in tissue engineering applications. This review profiles the tissue engineering advances in achieving control over the location and onset of bone formation (spatiotemporal control) toward avoiding the complications associated with BMP2.","[White, Kristopher A.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, 98 Brett Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Olabisi, Ronke M.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 599 Taylor Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Olabisi, RM (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 599 Taylor Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",ronke.olabisi@rutgers.edu,,"Olabisi, Ronke/0000-0003-3738-5250",,,,172,0,0,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2192-2640,2192-2659,,ADV HEALTHC MATER,Adv.

Material and Methods: Several heavy metals/oligoelements were compared by Inductive Coupled Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in hair samples from 130 patients (n = 54 patients with long-term titanium dental implants and amalgams (A + I group), 51 patients with long-term dental amalgam alone (A group), as well as controls (n = 25: without dental materials) of similar age. All patients (except controls) had had titanium dental implants and/or dental amalgams for at least 10 years (average: 17). We evaluated whether A + I patients could present higher systemic malondialdehyde levels (MDA) as compared to the A group. Results: The A + I group have lower molybdenum levels (A + I) and reduced Mo/Co and Mo/Fe2+ ratios, which could predispose them to oxidative stress by raising MDA levels as compared to the A group alone; our findings suggest that higher Co levels could enhance oxidative stress in the A + I group. However, there were no differences on metals from titanium alloy (Ti-6Al), Cr from crowns or Hg2+, Sn, Zn2+, Cu2+ levels between the A + I and A groups. Conclusion: patients with long-term dental titanium and amalgams have systemic oxidative stress due to rising MDA levels and lower Mo/Co and Mo/Fe2+ ratios than those with amalgams alone.","[Eugenia Cabana-Munoz, Maria; Parmigiani-Izquierdo, Jose Maria; Joaquin Merino, Jose] Ctr CIROM, Ctr Implantol & Rehabilitac Oral Multidisciplinar, Murcia 30001, Spain; [Camacho Alonso, Fabio] Univ Murcia, Fac Med, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Camacho Alonso, Fabio] Univ Murcia, Hosp Gen Univ Morales Meseguer, E-30100 Murcia 30100, Spain","Merino, JJ (reprint author), Ctr CIROM, Ctr Implantol & Rehabilitac Oral Multidisciplinar, Murcia 30001, Spain.",mecjj@clinicacirom.com; jmparmi@clinicacirom.com; fcamacho@um.es; josem2005@yahoo.es,,"Camacho-Alonso, Fabio/0000-0002-3739-1792","CIROM (Centro de Implantologia y Rehabilitacion Oral Multidisciplinaria, Murcia, Spain)","CIROM (Centro de Implantologia y Rehabilitacion Oral Multidisciplinaria, Murcia, Spain).",,41,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2077-0383,,,J CLIN MED,J.

However, stresses due to both the freezing and the drying steps of the lyophilization process can be harmful to protein stability, and appropriate excipients must be added to minimize detrimental effects. In this work, molecular dynamics was used to provide insight into the mechanisms of protein stabilization by different osmolytes, using lactate dehydrogenase as model protein. Our simulations indicate that good cryoprotectants are not always equally good as lyoprotectants, suggesting that synergistic effects may arise when different excipients are combined. This observation is in accordance with the experimental results. In fact, the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase after freeze-drying was investigated for various formulations, and the trend predicted by molecular dynamics was confirmed. More specifically, we found that the most effective stabilization of the protein structure is achieved when a good cryoprotectant is coupled with an efficient lyoprotectant. Ultimately, we propose a new approach to the design of formulations for protein-based therapeutics to be lyophilized, which combines simulations and experiments.

The bioreduction takes place in cell cultures of C. reinhardtii at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, thus eliminating the need for specialized equipment, harmful reducing agents or the generation of toxic byproducts. In addition to the visual changes in the cell culture, the production of AgNPs was confirmed by the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band in the range of 415-425 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometry and further evolution of the SPR peaks were studied by comparing the peak intensity at maximum absorbance over time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) determined that the NPs were Ag-0. Micrographs from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that 97 +/- 2% AgNPs were <10 nm in diameter. Ag+ to AgNP conversion was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The AgNPs were stable over time in the cell culture media, acetone, NaCl and reagent alcohol solutions.

Therefore, micro and nano scales play a crucial role in directing cell behaviors on biomaterials surface. In recent years, a series of biomaterials surface with micro and/or nano scales, such as micro-patterns, nanotubes and nanoparticles, have been developed to control the target cell behavior, and further enhance the surface biocompatibility.

The field has been very active over the last decades, but the complex conformational behaviour of peptides still poses challenges to the characterisation and rational design of defined structures. In this context, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of linear water-soluble monomeric peptides able to form the two simplest structural motifs: alpha-helices and beta-hairpins. For both structures, we describe the geometry features, and the main contributions to stability: intrinsic propensities, position dependence of specific residues, particular capping motifs and side chain interactions. They should be considered to design alpha-helical or beta-hairpin peptides. Solvent influence on peptide stability and selected in silico design approaches are also discussed. Moreover, we provide guidelines for structural characterisation of alpha-helical and beta-hairpin-forming peptides by NMR and circular dichroism. We also highlight recently reported designed peptides and current strategies developed to improve their stability, bioactivity and bioavailability. The information gathered herein may aid peptide design and characterisation of stable alpha-helical and beta-hairpin motifs in the search of biological constructs or improved peptide therapeutics.","[Morales, Paula; Jimenez, M.

In order to improve the mechanical properties, we added tungsten amounts of 3.88 to 12.20 wt.% and analyzed the results obtained. The successive melting of the samples was done using a vacuum arc furnace in a copper crucible cooled with water. Following micro-structural investigations, we found this alloy possessed a homogeneous structure and showed beta-phase predominance.

For instance, they do not consist of repeating monomer units but rather present a highly crosslinked structure resembling the chemistry of the precursor used for deposition. Due to the complex nature of the deposition process, plasma polymers have historically been produced with little control over the chemistry of the plasma phase which is still poorly understood. Yet, plasma polymer research is thriving, in par with the commercialisation of innumerable products using this technology, in fields ranging from biomedical to green energy industries. Here, we briefly summarise the principles at the basis of plasma deposition and highlight recent progress made in understanding the unique chemistry and reactivity of these films. We then demonstrate how carefully designed plasma polymer films can serve the purpose of fundamental research and biomedical applications.

Optical analysis of as-built samples revealed microstructure built of martensite needles and columnar grains, growing epitaxially towards the built direction. External and internal pores, un-melted or semi-melted powder particles and inclusions in the examined samples were also observed. The strength and Young's modulus of the DMLS samples before heat treatment was higher than for cast and forged samples; however, the elongation at break for vertical and horizontal orientation was lower than required for biomedical implants. After heat treatment, the hardness of the samples decreased, which is associated with the disappearance of boundary effect and martensite decomposition to lamellar mixture of a and (3, and the anisotropic behaviour of the material also disappears. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength(YS) also decreased, while elongation increased. Tensile properties were sensitive to the build orientation, which indicates that DMLS generates anisotropy of material as a result of layered production and elongated (3 prior grains. It was noticed that inappropriate selection of parameters did not allow properties corresponding to the standards to be obtained due to the high porosity and defects of the microstructure caused by insufficient energy density.","[Mierzejewska, Zaneta Anna; Sidun, Jaroslaw] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Mech Engn, Ul Wiejska 45c, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland; [Hudak, Radovan] Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Biomed Engn & Measurements, Ul Letna 1-9, Kosice 04200, Slovakia","Mierzejewska, ZA (reprint author), Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Mech Engn, Ul Wiejska 45c, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",a.mierzejewska@pb.edu.pl; radovan.hudak@tuke.sk; j.sidun@pb.edu.pl,,"Sidun, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-9616-7299; Mierzejewska, Zaneta/0000-0002-8363-9090","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Republic of Poland [MB/WM/12/2016, S/WM/1/2017]","This work was supported by funds for science of Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Republic of Poland, project no.

Despite the advantages of gelatin, poor mechanical properties, sensitivity to enzymatic degradation, high viscosity, and reduced solubility in concentrated aqueous media have limited its applications and encouraged the development of gelatin-based composite hydrogels. The drawbacks of gelatin may be surmounted by synergistically combining it with a wide range of polysaccharides. The addition of polysaccharides to gelatin is advantageous in mimicking the ECM, which largely contains proteoglycans or glycoproteins. Moreover, gelatin-polysaccharide biomaterials benefit from mechanical resilience, high stability, low thermal expansion, improved hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, and wound healing potential. Here, we discuss how combining gelatin and polysaccharides provides a promising approach for developing superior therapeutic biomaterials. We review gelatin-polysaccharides scaffolds and their applications in cell culture and tissue engineering, providing an outlook for the future of this family of biomaterials as advanced natural therapeutics.","[Afewerki, Samson; Sheikhi, Amir; Kannan, Soundarapandian; Khademhosseini, Ali] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Biomat Innovat Res Ctr,Div Biomed Engn, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Afewerki, Samson; Sheikhi, Amir; Kannan, Soundarapandian; Khademhosseini, Ali] MIT, Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sheikhi, Amir; Ahadian, Samad; Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, C MIT, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sheikhi, Amir; Ahadian, Samad; Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif NanoSyst Inst CNSI, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sheikhi, Amir; Ahadian, Samad; Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kannan, Soundarapandian] Periyar Univ, Dept Zool, Nanomed Div, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Radiol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Konkuk Univ, Coll Anim Biosci & Technol, Dept Bioind Technol, Seoul, South Korea","Khademhosseini, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, C MIT, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",khademh@ucla.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [AR057837, AR066193, EB021857, HL137193, CA214411, EB023052, HL140618, GM126831, HL140951, AR073135, AR069564]; University Grants Commission; Sweden-America Foundation (The family Mix Entrepreneur foundation); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)","National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Numbers: AR057837, AR066193, EB021857, HL137193, CA214411, EB023052, HL140618, GM126831, HL140951, AR073135, AR069564; University Grants Commission; Sweden-America Foundation (The family Mix Entrepreneur foundation); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)",,296,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2380-6761,,,BIOENG TRANSL MED,Bioeng.

This innovative and facile way of fibers production regulates the interfacial properties to enhance cells adhesion and filopodia formation on fibrous tissue scaffolds for possible bone regeneration. Tuning surface chemistry of polycaprolactone (PCL) by altering voltage polarity during electrospinning allows to double the surface potential on fibers up to 145 mV, which is directly measured using Kelvin probe force microscopy. The obtained surface potential on PCL fibers is directly correlated with surface chemistry analyzed at the grazing angle by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, showing lower oxygen content at PCL fiber surfaces, produced with negative voltage polarity, PCL (-). These fibers create well-engineered scaffolds that are able to increase significantly cell proliferation that is visualized with fluorescence microscopy, and filopodia formation on positively charged fibers, investigated with high-resolution scanning electron microscopy.

Thus, it is a challenge to develop biomaterials that promote bone regeneration as potential materials for bone repair. This work is devoted to the fabrication of bioceramics composed of silica and titanium oxide with various concentrations of titanium oxide for developing bone repair materials for dentistry and tissue engineering. The silica-based bioceramics were synthesized using the sol-gel method, and titanium oxide was added from the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate. The surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition was measured using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and the crystal structure was identified by using an X-ray diffraction diffractometer. The pH value and ion concentrations released in simulated body fluids after immersion with bioceramic samples were measured using a pH meter and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. In the cell toxicity test, the human osteosarcoma cells (MG63) were used and quantitatively assessed using an MTT assay. The results showed that the proposed bioceramics can be controlled by tuning the Si/Ti ratio to modify the dissolution rate of samples and enhance the formation of apatite. Compared to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) groups, the cell number of the BG_Ti75 group can be increased to 120%. Furthermore, BG_Ti75 can promote MG63 cell growth with statistical significance and keep the pH value and the released calcium ion concentrations of the soaking environment stable. The proposed bioceramics show potential for bone-regenerating capability.","[Chen, I-Hao; Lian, Meng-Jia; Fang, Wei; Huang, Bo-Rui; Liu, Tzu-Hao; Chen, Jhih-An; Lee, Tzer-Min] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Sch Dent, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Huang, Bo-Rui] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Huang, Chih-Ling] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Ctr Fundamental Sci, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Lee, Tzer-Min] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Oral Med, Coll Med, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Huang, CL (reprint author), Kaohsiung Med Univ, Ctr Fundamental Sci, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.",a0929000761@gmail.com; sy2es93103@gmail.com; sky918572@gmail.com; justinjoely@gmail.com; diegoliu92139@gmail.com; bleach377231@gmail.com; chihling@kmu.edu.tw; tmlee@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan [MOST-107-2221-E-037-003]; Kaohsiung Medical University Research Foundation [KMU-Q107023],This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan (grant number MOST-107-2221-E-037-003) and Kaohsiung Medical University Research Foundation (grant number KMU-Q107023).,,24,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-3417,,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

These biomaterials offer large surface areas for cell or biomaterial attachment, proliferation, biosensing and drug delivery applications. Among 3D scaffolds, the ones based on conjugated polymers (CPs) and natural nonconductive polymers arranged in a 3D architecture provide tridimensionality to cellular culture along with a high surface area for cell adherence and proliferation as well electrical conductivity for stimulation or sensing. However, the scaffolds must also obey other characteristics: homogeneous porosity, with pore sizes large enough to allow cell penetration and nutrient flow; elasticity and wettability similar to the tissue of implantation; and a suitable composition to enhance cell matrix interactions. In this Review, we summarize the fabrication methods, characterization techniques and main applications of conductive 3D scaffolds based on conductive polymers. The main barrier in the development of these platforms has been the fabrication and subsequent maintenance of the third dimension due to challenges in the manipulation of conductive polymers. In the last decades, different approaches to overcome these barriers have been developed for the production of conductive 3D scaffolds, demonstrating a huge potential for biomedical purposes. Finally, we present an overview of the emerging strategies developed to manufacture 3D conductive scaffolds, the techniques used to fully characterize them, and the biomedical fields where they have been applied.","[Alegret, Nuria; Dominguez-Alfaro, Antonio; Mecerreyes, David] POLYMAT Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Ave Tolosa 72, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Alegret, Nuria] Univ Colorado Denver, Div Cardiol, Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Anschutz Med Campus,12700 E 19th Ave,Bldg P15, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Dominguez-Alfaro, Antonio] CIC BiomaGUNE, Carbon Nanobiotechnol Grp, Paseo Miramon 182, Donostia San Sebastian 2014, Spain; [Mecerreyes, David] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerasque, Bilbao 48013, Spain","Alegret, N; Mecerreyes, D (reprint author), POLYMAT Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Ave Tolosa 72, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain.; Alegret, N (reprint author), Univ Colorado Denver, Div Cardiol, Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Anschutz Med Campus,12700 E 19th Ave,Bldg P15, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.; Mecerreyes, D (reprint author), Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerasque, Bilbao 48013, Spain.",nuria.alegret@ehu.es; david.mecerreyes@ehu.es,,"Mecerreyes, David/0000-0002-0788-7156","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [753293]; European Research Council, Starting Grant Innovative Polymers for Energy Storage (iPes) [306250]","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 753293, acronym NanoBEAT, and European Research Council by Starting Grant Innovative Polymers for Energy Storage (iPes) 306250.",,90,1,1,13,13,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1525-7797,1526-4602,,BIOMACROMOLECULES,Biomacromolecules,JAN,2019,20,1,,,,,73.0,89,,10.1021/acs.biomac.8b01382,,,,17,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Organic; Polymer Science",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science,HI3KV,WOS:000456349600005,30543402.0,,,,2019-02-25

Each monomer from the small library was prepared via a single step functionalization reaction of the phenolic groups of magnolol. Thermoset materials were realized through solvent-free, thiol-ene reactions, and the resulting cross-linked materials were each comprised of thioether and ester linkages, with one retaining the hydrophilic phenols from magnolol, another having the phenols protected as an acetonide, and two others incorporating the phenols into additional cross-linking sites via hydrolytically labile carbonates or stable ether linkages. With this diversity of chemical compositions and structures, the thermosets displayed a range of thermomechanical properties including glass transition temperatures, T-g, 29-52 degrees C, onset of thermal degradation, T-d, from about 290-360 degrees C, and ultimate strength up to 50 MPa. These tunable materials were studied in their degradation and biological properties with the aim of exploiting the antioxidant properties of the natural product. Hydrolytic degradation occurred under basic conditions (pH = 11) in all thermosets, but with kinetics that were dependent upon their chemical structures and mechanical properties: 20% mass loss was observed at 5, 7, 27, and 40 weeks for the thermosets produced from magnolol directly, acetonide-protected magnolol, bis(allyl carbonate)-functionalized magnolol, and bis(allyl ether)-functionalized magnolol, respectively. Isolated degradation products and model compounds displayed antioxidant properties similar to magnolol, as determined by both UV-vis and in vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. As these magnolol-based thermosets were found to also allow for extended cell culture, these materials may serve as promising degradable biomaterials.","[Wacker, Kevin T.; Lim, Soon-Mi; Khan, Sarosh; Felder, Simcha E.; Wooley, Karen L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, College Stn, TX 77842 USA; [Wacker, Kevin T.; Lim, Soon-Mi; Khan, Sarosh; Felder, Simcha E.; Wooley, Karen L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem Engn, College Stn, TX 77842 USA; [Wacker, Kevin T.; Lim, Soon-Mi; Khan, Sarosh; Felder, Simcha E.; Wooley, Karen L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77842 USA; [Wacker, Kevin T.; Lim, Soon-Mi; Khan, Sarosh; Felder, Simcha E.; Wooley, Karen L.] Texas A&M Univ, Lab Synthet Biol Interact, College Stn, TX 77842 USA; [Weems, Andrew C.; Dove, Andrew P.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Wooley, KL (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, College Stn, TX 77842 USA.; Wooley, KL (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem Engn, College Stn, TX 77842 USA.; Wooley, KL (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77842 USA.; Wooley, KL (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Lab Synthet Biol Interact, College Stn, TX 77842 USA.",wooley@chem.tamu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CHE-1610311]; Welch Foundation [A-0001]; ERC [681559],We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation (CHE-1610311) and the Welch Foundation through the W.

The biomedical potential of the prepared polymers was further fortified by an in vitro cytotoxicity study, where all polymers appeared to be noncytotoxic.

Over the last few decades, it has been increasingly important to have a deeper insight into the mechanisms of FBR is needed to develop biomaterials for better integration with living systems. In the light of recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, particularly in the field of biosensors and biodegradable tissue engineering scaffolds, the classical concepts related to the FBR have acquired new dimensions. The aim of this review is to provide a holistic view of the FBR, while critically analyzing the challenges, which need to be addressed in the future to overcome this innate response. In particular, this review discusses the relevant experimental methodology to assess the host response.

However, synthesis of the nanocomposites still remains a major challenge that often involves two-step process in which silver nanoparticles are synthesized ex situ. Additionally, polymers used in the nanocomposites are commonly not antimicrobial and biodegradable thus often lack bioactivity and biocompatibility. Herein we report highly active dual-function polymer-silver nanocomposites consisting of an inherently antimicrobial and biodegradable polymer in one-pot. A simple method of in situ reduction of a silver salt was employed to synthesize the silver nanoparticles (5-15 nm) from silver para-toluenesulfonate in which the intrinsically biodegradable and antimicrobial polymer N,N-dimethyl-N-hexadecyl ammonium chitin tosylate acted as reducing as well as stabilizing agent. The nanocomposite with the water-insoluble and organo-soluble polymer was simply painted onto surfaces via facile noncovalent immobilization. Notably, composite-coated surfaces inactivated both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria including pathogenic fungi at a much faster rate than polymer alone. The composites released active silver ions over an extended period of time and displayed remarkably long-lasting activity. In addition, surfaces coated with composites effectively inhibited both bacterial and fungal biofilm formation. Further, upon coating on catheter, the nanocomposites reduced methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) burden both on catheter (>99.99% reduction) and in tissues surrounding the catheter (>99.999% reduction) in a mice model.

Further, bioreactors and functional biomaterials have been designed based on this principle to modulate cellular behavior under in vitro conditions. Herein, we have designed a magnetic actuator device (MAD) to understand the fundamental responses of two different phenomena: the effect of actuation on cardiac muscle cells and drug delivery under the influence of pulsed magnetic field. Silk fibroin (SF)-based magnetically responsive matrix, developed by incorporating magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) within silk nanofibers was actuated with MAD. The silk matrix was seeded with cells and drugs independently to study effect of physical actuation by MAD on cellular behavior and drug release properties. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells were used for studying the former while model drug was used to observe the latter. Pulsed magnetic stimulation promoted proliferation of cells, at a significantly higher rate in comparison to those under static conditions, p <= 0.01. For instance, a significantly higher expression of Connexin 43 gene was observed in both H9c2 and primary rat cardiomyocytes under magnetic stimulation compared to nonstimulation conditions after day 14, p <= 0.01. A differential drug release profile corresponding to respective actuation frequency was observed while studying drug release properties. Overall, the device can be applied as a non-invasive technique to stimulate cardiac cells grown under laboratory conditions for developing functional artificial construct coupled with additional regulated drug release properties. The study thus demonstrates versatile applications of MAD in biomedical and tissue engineering.","[Chouhan, Dimple; Mehrotra, Shreya; Majumder, Omkar; Mandal, Biman B.] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Biomat & Tissue Engn Lab, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India","Mandal, BB (reprint author), Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Biomat & Tissue Engn Lab, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India.",biman.mandal@iitg.ernet.in,,,"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) [BT/PR25081/NER/95/1000/2017, BT/548/NE/U-Excel/2014]; Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","B.B.M. greatly acknowledges Department of Biotechnology (DBT, Grant BT/PR25081/NER/95/1000/2017, BT/548/NE/U-Excel/2014) and Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India for generous funding.

These bioprinting methods construct tissue replacements by positioning cells encapsulated in bioinks into specific locations in the resulting constructs. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) serve as an important tool when engineering neural tissues. These cells can be expanded indefinitely and differentiated into the cell types found in the central nervous systems, including neurons. One common method for differentiating hiPSCs into neural tissue requires the formation of aggregates inside of defined diameter microwells cultured in chemically defined media. However, 3D bioprinting of such hiPSC-derived aggregates has not been previously reported in the literature, as it requires the development of specialized bioinks for supporting cell survival and differentiation into mature neural phenotypes. Here we detail methods including preparing base material components of the bioink, producing the bioink, and the steps involved in printing 3D neural tissues derived from hiPSC-derived neural aggregates using Aspect Biosystems' novel RX1 printer and their lab-on-a printer (LOP) technology.","[Abelseth, Emily; Abelseth, Laila] Univ Victoria, Biomed Engn Program, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [De la Vega, Laura; Willerth, Stephanie M.] Univ Victoria, Dept Mech Engn, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Willerth, Stephanie M.] Univ Victoria, Div Med Sci, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Beyer, Simon T.; Wadsworth, Samuel J.] Aspect Biosyst, 1781 W 75th Ave, Victoria, BC V6P 6P2, Canada","Willerth, SM (reprint author), Univ Victoria, Dept Mech Engn, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.; Willerth, SM (reprint author), Univ Victoria, Div Med Sci, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",willerth@uvic.ca,,,Stem Cell Network; British Columbia Innovation Council Ignite grant program; Canada Research Chairs program; NSERC Discovery Grant program,"This work was funded by the Stem Cell Network (S.M.W. and Aspect Biosystems), British Columbia Innovation Council Ignite grant program (S.M.W. and Aspect Biosystems), the Canada Research Chairs program (S.M.W), and the NSERC Discovery Grant program (S.M.W.)",,34,0,0,6,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2373-9878,,,ACS BIOMATER SCI ENG,ACS Biomater.

Three-dimensional (3D) scaffold biomaterials simultaneously emulating skeletal hierarchy and eliciting sustainable osteogenetic and antibacterial functionalities represent a potent solution holding increasing fascination. Here we describe a simple combinatorial strategy for constructing such scaffolds. Fully porous titanium was first tailor-made by metallic powder 3D printing and subjected to in situ hydrothermal growth of a micro/nanostructured titanate layer, to which nanosilver encapsulated, physically cross-linked silk fibrin multilayer films were anchored through polydopamine-assisted, silk-on-silk self assembly. The hydrophilicity, protein adsorption, and surface bioactivity of the scaffolds were investigated. Employing clinically relevant pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, we tested that the silver immobilized scaffolds not only reduced adherence of bacteria on the surface, they also actively killed those planktonic, and these performances were largely maintained over an extended period of 6 weeks. Additionally, our engineered scaffolds were amenable to 14 days' continuous, intense bacterial attacks showing little sign of biofilm colonization, and they were interestingly capable of eradicating bacteria in already formed biofilms. High cargo loading, durable topical Ag release, and overwhelming oxidative stress were shown to contribute to this sustainable antibacterial system. Irrespective of certain degree of cellular stress at early stages, our scaffolds elicited generally enhanced cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase enzyme production, and matrix calcification of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1. These multifunctionalities, coupled with the design freedom, shape flexibility, and cost-effectiveness offered by 3D printing, make our scaffold biomaterials a promising option for customized restoration of complicated infective bone defects.","[Jia, Zhaojun; Guo, Hui; Zheng, Yufeng] Peking Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Jia, Zhaojun; Zhou, Wenhao; Yan, Jianglong; Xiong, Pan; Cheng, Yan; Zheng, Yufeng] Peking Univ, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Ctr Biomed Mat & Tissue Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Jia, Zhaojun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Pokfulam, 21 Sassoon Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Zheng, YF (reprint author), Peking Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Cheng, Y; Zheng, YF (reprint author), Peking Univ, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Ctr Biomed Mat & Tissue Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",chengyan@pku.edu.cn; yfzheng@pku.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51431002, 51871004]; NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme [5161101031]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1102402]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 51431002 and 51871004), NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme (Grant 5161101031) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2016YFC1102402).",,58,0,0,3,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2373-9878,,,ACS BIOMATER SCI ENG,ACS Biomater.

The aim of the present work was the development of in situ gelling systems, based on poloxamer 407 (P407) or sodium alginate (Alg), loaded with platelet lysate (PL) to enhance cardiomyocyte survival after ischemia. Chondroitin sulfate (CS), a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan able to interact with different positively charged bioactive molecules, such as growth factors, was also investigated with both the systems. The gelation properties of both systems (viscosity, viscoelasticity, consistency by means of penetrometry, and injectability) were characterized in a physiological environment. In vitro evaluation of biocompatibility using fetal cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts) demonstrated that the PL loaded alginate/chondroitin sulfate system retained the highest number of viable cells with equal distribution of the populations of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Furthermore, the ability of the systems to improve cardiomyocyte survival after ischemia was also assessed. PL allowed for the highest degree of survival of cardiomyocytes after oxidative damage (simulating ischemic conditions due to MI) and both the Alg + CS PL and, to a greater extent, the PL alone demonstrated a considerable increase in survival of cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, an in situ gelling alginate chondroitin sulfate system, loaded with platelet lysate, was able to improve the survival of cardiomyocytes after oxidative damage resulting in a promising system to improve cardiac cell viability after ischemia.","[Saporito, Francesca; Rossi, Silvia; Bonferoni, Maria Cristina; Sandri, Giuseppina; Ferrarit, Franca] Univ Pavia, Dept Drug Sci, Viale Taramelli 12, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Baugh, Lauren M.; Black, Lauren] Tufts Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 4 Colby St, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Perotti, Cesare] Fdn IRCCS Policlin S Matteo, Immunohaematol & Transfus Serv, Apheresis & Cell Therapy Unit, Viale Golgi 19, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Sandri, G (reprint author), Univ Pavia, Dept Drug Sci, Viale Taramelli 12, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.; Black, L (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 4 Colby St, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",giuseppina.sandri@unipv.it; lauren.black@tufts.edu,,"Sandri, Giuseppina/0000-0001-6766-9321",ABOCA Societa Agricola S.p.A.; Pavia-Boston project (University of Pavia); American Heart Association [16GRNT27760100],F.S. wishes to thank ABOCA Societa Agricola S.p.A. for her PhD grant and the Pavia-Boston project (University of Pavia) for her mobility grant.

Due to their limitations, reconstructive urologists are waiting for a novel material, which would be suitable for urinary tract wall replacement. Human amniotic membrane (AM) is a naturally derived biomaterial with a capacity to support reepithelization and inhibit scar formation. AM has a potential to become a considerable asset for reconstructive urology, i.e., reconstruction of ureters, urinary bladder, and urethrae. Areas covered: This review aims to discuss the potential application of human AM in reconstructive urology. The environment for urinary tract healing is particularly unfavorable due to the presence of urine. Due to its fetal origin, the bioactivity of AM is orientated to induce intrinsic regeneration mechanisms and inhibit scarring. This review introduces the concept of applying human AM in reconstructive urology procedures to improve their outcomes and future tissue engineering based strategies. Expert opinion: Many fields of medicine that have accomplished translational research have proven the usefulness of AM in clinical practice. There is an urgent need for studies to be conducted on large animal models that might convincingly demonstrate the underestimated potential of AM to urologists around the world.","[Adamowicz, Jan; Tyloch, Dominik; Pokrywczynska, Marta; Drewa, Tomasz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Regenerat Med, Coll Med, Chair Urol, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Van Breda, Shane] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Biomed, Basel, Switzerland","Adamowicz, J (reprint author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Univ Hosp, Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 9, PL-85094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",adamowicz.jz@gmail.com,,,,,,130,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1471-2598,1744-7682,,EXPERT OPIN BIOL TH,Expert Opin.

Various treatments have been proposed to mitigate calcification of glutaraldehyde-fixed bioprosthetic valves but none have succeeded in inhibiting or mitigating efficiently the calcification process of the implantable biological tissues. Since the discovery of calcitonin (CT) and its therapeutic role in treating hypercalcemic patients, CT has never been tried as an anticalcification treatment for biomaterials. It is postulated, that tissue calcification may be efficiently minimized by forming adducts with aldehyde groups thus eliminating the places of the biological tissues onto the calcium cations could be deposited. Material and methods: Fresh porcine aortic leaflets were cut radially in three parts. Three groups of tissue were created. Group I (glutaraldehyde only), Group II (glutaraldehyde with 1% CT) and Group III (glutaraldehyde with 10% CT). All tissues were then implanted subdermally in three sets of 8 (Group I) and 9 (Group II and Group III) male Wistar rats of 12 days old. 21 days later the rats were euthanized by inhalation of CO2. The tissues were retrieved and after rinsing with distilled water 3 times, were lyophilized at -40 degrees C at high vacuum pressure of approximately 100 mmHg for 16 h. The calcium content was then measured with flat atomic absorption technique. Results: The preimplantation values of Ca concentration as expressed in mg Ca/g of tissue were 1.79 +/- 0.14 in Group I, 4.78 +/- 0.0079 in Group II and 2.88 +/- 0.17 in Group III (p = ns). 21 days later the values of Ca concentration were 126.95 +/- 12.97 for Group 1, 24.69 +/- 2.71 for Group 11 (p < 0.05) and 27.16 +/- 2.95 for Group III (p < 0.05). There was not significance difference between Groups II and III, even if Group II showed a less accumulation of Ca concentration (x5.16) than Group III (x9.43). Conclusion: An anticalcification treatment based on calcitonin as an additive to buffered glutaraldehyde, mitigates the calcification process of the implantable biological tissues, as compared to glutaraldehyde treatment only.

To realise the multiple functions of orthopaedic implants, hybrid system that contains several different materials or parts have also been designed for application, such as prosthesis for total hip arthroplasty. Fixation of osteoporotic fracture is challenging as the current metal implants made of stainless steel or titanium that are rather rigid and bioinert, which are not favourable for enhancing fracture healing and subsequent remodelling. Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are reported to possess good biocompatibility, biodegradability and osteopromotive effects during its in vivo degradation and now tested as a new generation of degradable metallic biomaterials. Several recent clinical studies reported the Mg-based screws for bone fixation, although the history of testing Mg as fixation implant was documented more than 100 years ago. Truthfully, Mg has its limitations as fixation implant, especially when applied at load-bearing sites because of rather rapid degradation. Currently developed Mg-based implants have only been designed for application at less or noneloading-bearing skeletal site(s). Therefore, after years research and development, the authors propose an innovative hybrid fixation system with parts composed of Mg and titanium or stainless steel to maximise the biological benefits of Mg; titanium or stainless steel in this hybrid system can provide enough mechanical support for fractures at load-bearing site(s) while Mg promotes the fracture healing through novel mechanisms during its degradation, especially in patients with osteoporosis and other metabolic disorders that are unfavourable conditions for fracture healing. This hybrid fixation strategy is designed to effectively enhance the osteoporotic fracture healing and may potentially also reduce the refracture rate. The translational potential of this article: This article systemically reviewed the combination utility of different metallic implants in orthopaedic applications. It will do great contribution to the further development of internal orthopaedic implants for fracture fixation.

Clinical interventions to treat tooth decay range from simple coronal fillings to invasive root canal treatment. Pulp capping is the only available clinical option to maintain the pulp vitality in deep lesions, but irreversible pulp inflammation and reinfection are frequent outcomes for this treatment. When affected pulp involvement is beyond repair, the dentist has to perform endodontic therapy leaving the tooth non-vital and brittle. On-going research strategies have failed to overcome the limitations of existing pulp capping materials so that healthy and progressive regeneration of the injured tissues is attained. Preserving pulp vitality is crucial for tooth homeostasis and durability, and thus, there is a critical need for clinical interventions that enable regeneration of the dentin-pulp complex to rescue millions of teeth annually. The identification and development of appropriate biomaterials for dentin-pulp scaffolds are necessary to optimize clinical approaches to regenerate these hybrid dental tissues. Likewise, a deep understanding of the interactions between the micro-environment, growth factors, and progenitor cells will provide design basis for the most fitting scaffolds for this purpose. In this review, we first introduce the long-lasting clinical dental problem of rescuing diseased tooth vitality, the limitations of current clinical therapies and interventions to restore the damaged tissues, and the need for new strategies to fully revitalize the tooth. Then, we comprehensively report on the characteristics of the main materials of naturally-derived and synthetically-engineered polymers, ceramics, and composite scaffolds as well as their use in dentin-pulp complex regeneration strategies. Finally, we present a series of innovative smart polymeric biomaterials with potential to overcome dentin-pulp complex regeneration challenges.","[Moussa, Dina G.; Aparicio, Conrado] Univ Minnesota, Sch Dent, Minnesota Dent Res Ctr Biomat & Biomech, Dept Restorat Sci, 16-250A Moos Tower,515 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Moussa, Dina G.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Conservat Dent, Fac Dent, Mansoura, Egypt","Aparicio, C (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Dent, Minnesota Dent Res Ctr Biomat & Biomech, Dept Restorat Sci, 16-250A Moos Tower,515 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",apari003@umn.edu,,"Aparicio, Conrado/0000-0003-2969-6067","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [R90-DE023058, RO1-DE026117]","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Grant/Award Numbers: R90-DE023058 and RO1-DE026117",,130,0,0,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1932-6254,1932-7005,,J TISSUE ENG REGEN M,J.

The single crystal conformations of two different types of two-helix motifs consisting of achiral alpha-peptide C-10-helix (3(10)) and chiral alpha,gamma-hybrid peptide C-12-helix revealed that the helices adopted antiparallel orientations across the planar NDI with 2-fold symmetry. The crystal conformations of two-helix motifs were further explored to design electrical conducting peptide foldamer by introducing electron rich pyrene (p-type) as a side-chain in the alpha,gamma-hybrid helix. The two-helix motif with charge transferable pyrene (p-type)-NDI (n-type) combination showed better electrical conductivity compared to the two-helix motif without pyrene side-chain. Moreover, the crystal conformations also provided molecular insight into the peptide orientation of NDI-peptide conjugates.

The set cements were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Radiopacity and setting time were analyzed according to ANSI/ADA 57 and ASTM C266-08. Volume change was evaluated using volumetric micro-CT analysis. The pH and calcium ion release were assessed after 3 and 24h and 28days. Dental discoloration in contact with the cements was assessed after 24h and 28 and 90days of contact with bovine and human dentine. Tissue reaction to subcutaneous implantation in rats was examined after 30 and 60days.ResultsAlF(3) altered the microstructure of MTA. The addition of 5% AlF3 did not significantly alter the radiopacity, setting time, and volume change (p>0.05). pH and calcium ion release significantly increased with addition of AlF3 (p>0.05). All the tested proportions of AlF3 prevented the dental darkening verified for MTA Angelus in bovine and human teeth. AlF3 did not interfere in inflammatory response of MTA in all periods of analysis; otherwise, lower amounts showed less intense inflammatory infiltrate.Clinical relevanceAlF(3) prevents destabilization of bismuth oxide and consequent tooth darkening, frequently verified in clinical practice when using white MTA.ConclusionsThe use of 5% of AlF3 in combination to MTA resulted in a cement that did not result in dental discoloration and did not affect significantly physical, chemical, and biological properties.","[Marciano, Marina Angelica] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dent Sch Piracicaba, Dept Restorat Dent, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Camilleri, Josette] Univ Birmingham, Sch Dent, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Lucateli, Ribamar Lazanha] Univ Sao Paulo, Dent Sch Ribeirao Preto, Dept Surg & Periodontol, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Costa, Reginaldo Mendonca; Hungaro Duarte, Marco Antonio] Univ Sao Paulo, Dent Sch Bauru, Dept Dent Endodont & Dent Mat, Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Matsumoto, Mariza Akemi] State Univ Sao Paulo UNESP, Dent Sch Aracatuba, Dept Morphol, Aracatuba, SP, Brazil","Marciano, MA (reprint author), Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dent Sch Piracicaba, Dept Restorat Dent, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",marinama@unicamp.br,,,"State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP 2014/01003-6, 2017/05096-7]","This work was supported by the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2014/01003-6, 2017/05096-7).",,27,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1432-6981,1436-3771,,CLIN ORAL INVEST,Clin.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not BDGF improves the efficacy of a modified carbonated calcium phosphate biomaterial in sinus floor augmentation.Material and methodsTen patients underwent 20 sinus floor augmentation procedures using nanostructured carbonated hydroxyapatite (cHA) microspheres alone or associated with BDGF in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The in vitro release of growth factors was assessed by an elution assay. Bone grafts were randomly implanted in the right and left maxillary sinuses of each participant, associated either with a 0.9% saline solution or BDGF. Bone gain was evaluated through cone beam tomography after 180days.ResultsNine women and one man composed the sample. The blood-derived concentrates were able to release high levels of growth factors and cytokines. A significant clinical advantage was observed in the use of the BDGF after fibrin polymerization around the biomaterial microspheres, optimizing the surgical procedures, thereby reducing the time and displacement, and improving the adaptation of the biomaterial in the maxillary sinus. No synergistic effect was observed in bone formation when cHA was associated with BDGF (p>0.05).ConclusionEquivalent new bone formation was observed for cHA in the presence or absence of the BDGF concentrate in bilateral sinus floor elevation after 6months. Blood-derived growth factors did not improve bone repair when associated with calcium phosphate in sinus lift procedures.","[de Almeida Barros Mourao, Carlos Fernando; Lourenco, Emanuelle Stellet; Barros Nascimento, Jhonathan Raphael; Mello Machado, Rafael Coutinho] Fluminense Fed Univ, Grad Program Dent, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [de Almeida Barros Mourao, Carlos Fernando; Alves, Gutemberg Gomes] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Inst Biol, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Rossi, Alexandre Malta] Brazilian Ctr Phys Studies, Biomat Lab, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Correa Leite, Paulo Emilio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biophys Carlos Chagas Filho, Lab Ultrastruct & Cellular Biol Hertha Meyer, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Granjeiro, Jose Mauro] Nacl Inst Metrol Qual & Technol, Duque De Caxias, RJ, Brazil; [Granjeiro, Jose Mauro] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dent Sch, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Calasans-Maia, Monica Diuana] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dent Sch, Oral Surg Dept, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil","Calasans-Maia, MD (reprint author), Fluminense Fed Univ, Dent Sch, Oral Surg Dept, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",mouraocf@gmail.com; monicacalasansmaia@gmail.com,"Leite, Paulo Emilio/N-3443-2013","Leite, Paulo Emilio/0000-0002-1783-1228; Mourao, Carlos Fernando/0000-0001-5775-0222",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/110.303/2014]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); INCT-REGENERA/CNPQ/FAPERJ,"This study if financially supported by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), process no.

After 7, 14, and 30days post-surgery, a fragment of each specimen was fixed in -80 degrees C liquid nitrogen for zymographic evaluation, while the remaining was fixed in 10% formalin for histological birefringence analysis.ResultsThe results of this study demonstrated that matrix organization in experimental groups was significantly improved compared to C considering collagenous organization. Zymographic analysis revealed pro-MMP-2, pro-MMP-9, and active (a)-MMP-2 in all groups, showing gradual decrease of total gelatinolytic activity during the periods. At day 7, BG presented more prominent gelatinolytic activity for pro-MMP-2 and 9 and a-MMP-2, when compared to the other groups. In addition, at day 7, a 53% activation ratio (active form/[active form + latent form]) was evident in C group, 33% in BS group, and 31% in BG group.ConclusionIn general, BS allowed the production of a BMX similar to BG, with organized collagen deposition and MMP-2 and MMP-9 disponibility, permitting satisfactory bone remodeling at the late period.Clinical relevanceThe evaluation of new bone substitute, with favorable biological properties, opens the possibility for its use as a viable and efficient alternative to autologous bone graft.","[Biguetti, Claudia Cristina; Saraiva, Patricia Pinto] Univ Sagrado Coracao, Res & Postgrad Prorectory, Rua Irma Arminda 10-50, BR-17011160 Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Biguetti, Claudia Cristina] Univ Sao Paulo, FOB USP, Bauru Sch Dent, Oral Biol Doctorals Program, Alameda Octavio Pinheiro Brizola 9-75, BR-17012901 Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Cavalla, Franco] Univ Chile, Sch Dent, Dept Conservat Dent, Sergio Livingstone 943, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Tim, Carla Roberta] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, UFSCAR, Biotechnol Doctorals Program, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235,SP-310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Orcini, Wilson] USC, Res & Postgrad Prorectory, Mol Biol Lab, Rua Irma Arminda 10-50, BR-17011160 Jardim, Brazil; [Holgado, Leandro De Andrade] USC, Dept Hlth Sci, Discipline Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Rua Irma Arminda 10-50, BR-17011160 Jardim Brasil Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Muniz Renno, Ana Claudia] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Biosci, Campus Baixada Santista UNIFESP, BR-11060001 Santos, SP, Brazil; [Matsumoto, Mariza Akemi] Sao Paulo State Univ, FOA UNESP, Dept Basic Sci, Discipline Histol & Embriol, Rua Paul Harris 1100,Casa 03, BR-18016110 Jardim Nova Iorque Araca, SP, Brazil","Biguetti, CC (reprint author), Univ Sagrado Coracao, Res & Postgrad Prorectory, Rua Irma Arminda 10-50, BR-17011160 Bauru, SP, Brazil.; Biguetti, CC (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, FOB USP, Bauru Sch Dent, Oral Biol Doctorals Program, Alameda Octavio Pinheiro Brizola 9-75, BR-17012901 Bauru, SP, Brazil.",Claudiabiguetti@Hotmail.Com,,,"Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP/SP) [2008/11485-8, 2009/17294-1]","This work was supported by Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP/SP), grant numbers 2008/11485-8; 2009/17294-1.",,38,0,0,2,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1432-6981,1436-3771,,CLIN ORAL INVEST,Clin.

This study used three distinct incremental build-up techniques, which included one shade (body), two shades (enamel and dentin), and three shades (enamel, transparent, and dentin).MethodsTwenty human, un-erupted, recently extracted third molars (shade B1) were used to obtain 40 tooth slabs. The samples were randomized and equally distributed into four experimental groups. The Positive Control Group included dental tissues with enamel, dento-enamel junction DEJ, and dentin; the Technique 1 group (T1) included one shade tissues, B1B; the Technique 2 group (T2) included two-shades tissues, A2Dentin and B1Enamel; and the Technique 3 group (T3) included three shade tissues, A2Dentin, Transparent, and B1Enamel. Cavity preparation was standardized, and, using the spectrophotometer, each specimen was irradiated by three LASERs. A voltmeter recorded the light-output signal, and from this raw data, the following optical constants (A, T, K, g) were calculated.ResultsANOVA, followed by a post hoc Tukey's test (p<0.05), revealed that absorption and transmittance in dental tissues were significantly different when comparing the three build-up technique groups. However, when examining attenuation coefficient, there was no significant difference in dental tissues for T2 and T3 as analyzed by blue and red lasers. There was also no significant difference among the three lasers for T2 and T3. There was also no significant effect of the types of experiments on the value of scattering anisotropy factor g for blue laser among the four experimental groups.ConclusionWithin the limitations of this study, none of the build-up techniques were able to reproduce the dental tissues optical properties, and T2 and T3 resulted in a similar pattern of light propagation.Clinical significanceThe clinical success of restorative procedures depends on selecting materials and techniques that emulate the natural tooth and provide long-term stability in color and optical properties.","[Elgendy, Hanan; Maia, Rodrigo Rocha; Denehy, Gerald] Univ Iowa, Coll Dent, Dept Operat Dent, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Skiff, Fredrick] Univ Iowa, Dept Phys & Astron, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Qian, Fang] Univ Iowa, Coll Dent, Div Biostat & Res Design, Iowa Inst Oral Hlth Res, Iowa City, IA USA; [Qian, Fang] Univ Iowa, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent & Community Dent, Iowa City, IA USA","Elgendy, H (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Coll Dent, Dept Operat Dent, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",,,,Project Pool from ADEA (American Dental Education Association),The work was supported by the Project Pool from ADEA (American Dental Education Association).,,26,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1432-6981,1436-3771,,CLIN ORAL INVEST,Clin.

Multifactorial targeted therapy is a promising strategy for SCI. Methods: The anti-inflammatory peptide KAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA (KAFAK) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-modified hyaluronan-methylcellulose (HAMC) hydrogel was designed for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal protein delivery. The physical and biological characteristics of HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel were measured in vitro. SCI model was performed in rats and HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel was injected into the injured site of spinal cord. The neuronal regeneration effect was evaluated by inflammatory cytokine levels, behavioral test and histological analysis at 8 weeks post operation. Results: HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel showed minimally swelling property and sustained release of the KAFAK and BDNF. HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel significantly improved the proliferation of PC12 cells in vitro without cytotoxicity. Significant recovery in both neurological function and nerve tissue morphology in SCI rats were observed in HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF group. HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF group showed significant reduction in proinflammatory cytokines expression and cystic cavitation, decreased glial scar formation, and improved neuronal survival in the rat SCI model compared to HAMC group and SCI group. Conclusion: The HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel promotes functional recovery of rats with spinal cord injury by regulating inflammatory cytokine levels and improving axonal regeneration.","[He, Zhijiang; Huang, Kui] Logist Univ, Chinese Peoples Armed Police Force PAP, Tianjin 300309, Peoples R China; [Zang, Hongxin] Chinese Peoples Armed Police Force PAP, Dept Nursing, Characterist Med Ctr, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lei] Chinese Peoples Armed Police Force PAP, Characterist Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China; [Yi, Tailong; Zhang, Sai; Cheng, Shixiang] Chinese Peoples Armed Police Force PAP, Inst TBI & Neurosci, Tianjin Key Lab Neurotrauma Repair, Characterist Med Ctr, 220 ChengLin Rd, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China","Zhang, S; Cheng, SX (reprint author), Chinese Peoples Armed Police Force PAP, Inst TBI & Neurosci, Tianjin Key Lab Neurotrauma Repair, Characterist Med Ctr, 220 ChengLin Rd, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China.",zhangsai718@vip.126.com; shixiangcheng@vip.126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation Major Program of China [81891003]; Science & Technology Program of Tianjin, China [15ZXLCSY00040, 16ZXHLSY00120]; Tianjin Municipal Natural Science Foundation [17JCYBJC25700];  [AWS15J001]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Major Program of China (81891003), the Science & Technology Program of Tianjin, China (15ZXLCSY00040, 16ZXHLSY00120), the Technology Research Projects (AWS15J001), and the Tianjin Municipal Natural Science Foundation (17JCYBJC25700).",,47,0,0,1,1,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1178-2013,,,INT J NANOMED,Int.

The development of biomaterials aims at providing support for the regeneration process. One strategy integrates peptides that mimic functional domains of extracellular matrix (ECM) or cell adhesion molecules with synthetic polymers designed to present growth-supporting cues to the neuronal microenvironment. Thus, small peptide sequences originating from molecules of the ECM may serve as promising bio-additives, acting as artificial matricryptins to gear cellular processes. The glycoprotein tenascin-C (Tnc) is a major constituent of the ECM of the developing brain and persists in the neurogenic regions of the adult CNS. It is a multimodular glycoprotein that comprises distinct domains with neurite growth promoting and axon growth repulsing properties. In the present study, the novel peptide motif VSWRAPTA that is encoded in the neurite growth promoting 6th fibronectin type III repeat close to the alternative splice site of Tnc was tested for its effects on neuron differentiation. When this newly synthesized biomimetic peptide was added to cultures of embryonic cortical neurons it significantly promoted the outgrowth of neurites. The neuron differentiation supporting effect was thereby associated with the trans-cellular activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. Cortical neurons supplemented with the Tnc peptide displayed a dose-dependent increase in neurite outgrowth that saturated at a peptide concentration of 50g/ml (56.4mMol/l). The analysis of neuron morphology revealed that neurite branching rather than fiber length was stimulated by the Tnc peptide. Therefore, we predict that the analyzed peptide motif of the 6th constitutively expressed FNIII domain of the Tnc molecule might be a major contributor for neurite outgrowth and guiding events in the native CNS microenvironment. In conclusion, the Tnc-derived VSWRAPTA peptide may represent a promising tool to spike regeneration supportive microenvironments.","[Jarocki, Marvin; Faissner, Andreas] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Cell Morphol & Mol Neurobiol, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Sallouh, Omar; Weberskirch, Ralf] TU Dortmund, Fac Chem & Chem Biol, Otto Hahn Str 6, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Faissner, A (reprint author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Cell Morphol & Mol Neurobiol, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",andreas.faissner@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,,"Faissner, Andreas/0000-0002-2211-8259","Mercur [PR-2011-0010]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [Fa 159/16-1, Fa 159/22-1]","The authors are grateful for grant support (Mercur PR-2011-0010 to RW and AF; German Research Foundation (DFG), Fa 159/16-1 and Fa 159/22-1 to AF).",,65,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0893-7648,1559-1182,,MOL NEUROBIOL,Mol.

Importantly the transition pH (pH=0.4) of the system can be predetermined in the range of 8.2-5.8 (assembled to disassembled) and 8.2-4.2 (disassembled to assembled), which ideally covers the pH of normal tissue, tumor tissue milieu and organelles.

Patient, implant, and surgical characteristics were collected, including implant survival, clinical manifestations, cause of arthroplasty revision or implant failure, and peri- and intra-operative complications. The primary endpoint was implant survivorship. Hip revision arthroplasty was decided considering clinical signs and symptoms, abnormal imaging (XR, MR, TC, echotomography, scintigraphy), and blood metal ion level. An ad hoc electronic form was used to collect demographic, epidemiological, and clinical variables. In-between group comparisons of quantitative variables were performed with the Student t test and the Mann-Whitney for parametric and non-parametric variables, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to assess the relationship between clinical and radiographic characteristics and stem and cup revision. Radiographic measurements of implant positioning validity and reliability were assessed using Krippendorff's alpha reliability coefficient. The statistical software STATA version 15 (StatsCorp, TX) was used to perform statistical computations.ResultsIn this MoM THA series, the most incident cause of implant failure was ARMD in 11 out of 14 (78.6%) patients. All clinical failure manifestations, revision surgery highlights, and intra-operative findings are reported.ConclusionsThe local adverse reactions include lesions of different clinical relevance from small asymptomatic soft tissue lesions to dramatic osteolysis, necrosis, effusion, and growing masses which can cause secondary pathological effects. Symptoms of systemic toxicity are rarely described but may have been largely unreported in literature. Despite the extensive literature on the topic, the patient's management is still uncertain and challenging. Every metallic implant (e.g., screws, plates, spinal instrumentations) has a potential local or systemic adverse effect. Organizing a national registry of arthroplasty should be mandatory, in order to collect data about the patients, the surgery, the implanted device (with a careful post-marketing tracking), and the follow-up for all the procedures performed at a national level. The data collected in the registry will allow to analyze the implant survival and to better recognize the undesirable and sometimes unexpected effects of different biomaterials on the whole body.","[Pisanu, Francesco; Doria, Carlo; Andreozzi, Matteo; Bartoli, Marco; Saderi, Laura; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Leali, Paolo Tranquilli] Univ Sassari, Sassari, Italy","Pisanu, F (reprint author), Univ Sassari, Sassari, Italy.",pisanuf@gmail.com,,,,,,50,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0341-2695,1432-5195,,INT ORTHOP,Int.

A biodegradable scaffold material might simplify the procedure. Purpose. The purpose of this in vivo study was to evaluate osteogenesis ability of a biodegradable CAD-CAM-fabricated polylactic acid (PLA) scaffold enriched with calcium phosphate salts including hydroxyapatite (HA) and beta tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) used to reconstruct mandibular defects in a dog model. Material and method. Surgical defects were made bilaterally in the mandible of male beagle dogs. Computerized tomography images were obtained for determination of the 3-dimensional shape of the defects after 3 months of healing. Porous PLA scaffolds were fabricated by milling custom-made CAD-CAM blocks into the desired shape. After milling, half of the scaffolds were prepared by filling the pores of the scaffolds by a mixture of HA and beta-TCP. Scaffolds were inserted in the mandibular defects bilaterally. After a healing time of 8 weeks, the bone-scaffold interface was analyzed histomorphometrically to detect the amount of new bone formation. Stained histological sections were examined using a computer software and depth of new bone formation was assessed (n=14, alpha=.05). Result. Histomorphometric analysis revealed that enriched scaffolds with calcium phosphates had significantly (t=4.4, P<.001) higher amounts of new bone formation (1.3 +/- 0.33 mm) compared with the controls (0.7 +/- 0.39 mm). Average new bone growth in enriched scaffolds was 1.3 mm while almost half this value was observed in uncoated scaffolds, 0.7 mm. Conclusion Within the limitations of this animal study, HA and beta-TCP enhanced osteogenesis ability of CAD-CAM-fabricated PLA scaffolds.","[Helal, Mohamed H.] Tanta Univ, Fac Dent, Oral Med Diag Radiol & Periodontol, Alexandria, Egypt; [Hendawy, Hebatullah D.; Gaber, Rowan A.; Helal, Nourhan R.] Alexandria Univ, Fac Dent, Biomat Lab, Alexandria, Egypt; [Aboushelib, Moustafa N.] Alexandria Univ, Fac Dent, Biomat, Alexandria, Egypt","Aboushelib, MN (reprint author), Alexandria Univ, Fac Dent, Biomat Dept, Champollion St, Alexandria, Egypt.",moustafaaboushelib@gmail.com,,"aboushelib, moustafa/0000-0003-1934-9440",,,,33,0,0,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0022-3913,1097-6841,,J PROSTHET DENT,J.

Three formulations of ion-substituted HAp powders were prepared via a wet-chemical precipitation method. Analysis and characterization by several techniques proved that the obtained powders were of apatitic nature. Although stoichiometry was slightly weaker, multiple ion-substitutions lead to stable structures. When sintering, calcined powders at 500 degrees C for 1h were uniaxially isostatically cold compacted into pellets.

The study was conducted in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution at 37 degrees C over 8 weeks. Reinforcement with nHA particles increased the elastic modulus and the yield stress, due perhaps to restricted C-C bond rotations and polymer sliding, although that increase was not proportional with the added percentages of nanoparticles. The elastic modulus and the yield stress of the films decreased faster than those of the scaffolds. As from the seventh week some samples could not be tested due to the fragility of the specimens. The scaffolds had a higher enthalpy of fusion than the films, suggesting that crystalline domains formed more easily in the scaffolds than in the films. The films degraded more quickly than the scaffolds, because the acid products resulting from the degradation process were evacuated from the films with greater difficulty than from the scaffolds in which the autocatalytic effect was of greater importance.

Plants produce a huge array of metabolites, with an immense diversity at both the population and individual levels. Dissection of the genetic bases for metabolic diversity has attracted increasing research attention. The concept of genome-wide association study (GWAS) was extended to studies on the diversity of plant metabolome that benefitted from the development of mass-spectrometry-based analytical systems and genome sequencing technologies. Metabolic genome-wide association study (mGWAS) is one of the most powerful tools for global identification of genetic determinants for diversity of plant metabolism. Recently, mGWAS has been performed for various species with continuous improvements, providing deeper insights into the genetic bases of metabolic diversity. In this review, we discuss fully the achievements to date and remaining challenges that are associated with both mGWAS and mGWAS-based multi-dimensional analysis. We begin with a summary of GWAS and its development based on statistical methods and populations. As variation in targeted traits is essential for GWAS, we review metabolic diversity and its rise at both the population and individual levels. Subsequently, the application of mGWAS for plants and its corresponding achievements are fully discussed. We address the current knowledge on mGWAS-based multi-dimensional analysis and emerging insights into the diversity of metabolism.","[Fang, Chuanying; Luo, Jie] Hainan Univ, Inst Trop Agr & Forestry, Hainan Key Lab Sustainable Utilisat Trop Bioresou, Haikou 470228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jie] Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jie] Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res Wuhan, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China","Luo, J (reprint author), Hainan Univ, Inst Trop Agr & Forestry, Hainan Key Lab Sustainable Utilisat Trop Bioresou, Haikou 470228, Hainan, Peoples R China.; Luo, J (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Luo, J (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res Wuhan, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jie.luo@hainu.edu.cn,,"Fang, Chuanying/0000-0003-3588-8743","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [31625021]; State Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31530052]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2016YFD0100500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31800250]; Hainan University Startup Fund (KYQD) [1866, 1824]","The research conducted in our laboratories was supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (no. 31625021), the State Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31530052), the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2016YFD0100500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31800250), and the Hainan University Startup Fund (KYQD(ZR)1866 to J.L., KYQD(ZR) 1824 to C.F.).",,141,1,1,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-7412,1365-313X,,PLANT J,Plant J.,JAN,2019,97,1,,,SI,,91.0,100,,10.1111/tpj.14097,,,,10,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,HH1UY,WOS:000455506600007,30231195.0,,,,2019-02-25

However, the mechanical properties and osteogenic activities of many current calcium phosphate materials are not ideal, which limit their biological applications. Therefore, it is an effective alternative strategy to study the modification of calcium phosphate biomaterials to address these limitations. In this research, in order to enhance the biological performance of tricalcium phosphate (-TCP), metal species (Fe and Zn) modified -TCP materials through the co-precipitation method were successfully developed. The physical, chemical and biological properties of the binary composites were carefully studied for the first time. The bioactivities of the Fe-TCP and Zn-TCP were evaluated by simulating body fluid (SBF) immersion experiments, blood compatibility, and cytotoxicity tests.

Results CorMatrix showed gradual and consistent patch resorption and subsiding inflammatory and fibrosis process. Full scaffold degradation and replacement by mild fibrosis and subcutaneous tissue were seen by 1 year. Xenopericardial patches remained intact, and the initially severe inflammatory and fibrotic reactions reduced gradually to moderate fibrosis and chronic inflammation. Gore-Tex showed foreign body reaction. Conclusions Patches were biotolerated by pigs. Xenopericardial patches elicited encapsulating fibrosis and no remodeling. CorMatrix resorbs completely and degrades consistently without leaving residues.

Titanium nanotubes are considered promising heart valve stent materials owing to their effects on modulation of macrophage behavior. However, the effects of nanotube-regulated macrophages on endothelial cells, which are essential for stent endothe-lialization, are unknown. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the inflammatory responses of endothelial cells to titanium nanotubes prepared at different voltages. Methods and results: In this study we used three different voltages (20, 40, and 60 V) to produce titania nanotubes with three different diameters by anodic oxidation. The state of macrophages on the samples was assessed, and the supernatants were collected as conditioned media (CM) to stimulate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), with pure titanium as a control group. The results indicated that titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes induced macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 state and increased the expression of arginase-1, mannose receptor, and interleukin 10. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that M2 macrophage polarization controlled by the TiO2 nanotube surface activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways through release of vascular endothelial growth factor to influence endothelialization. Conclusion: Our findings expanded our understanding of the complex influence of nanotubes in implants and the macrophage inflammatory response. Furthermore, CM generated from culture on the TiO2 nanotube surface may represent an integrated research model for studying the interactions of two different cell types and may be a promising approach for accelerating stent endothelialization through immunoregulation.","[Xu, Wei-Chang; Dong, Xiao; Liu, Ji-Chun; Xu, Jian-Jun; Tang, Yan-Hua; Lu, Chao; Yang, Wei; Yang, Jue-Sheng; Gong, Yi; Zhou, Jian-Liang] Nanchang Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Affiliated Hosp 2, 1 Minde Rd, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jing-Li] Nanchang Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Affiliated Hosp 2, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yi, Ying-Ping] Nanchang Univ, Dept Sci & Educ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Zhou, JL (reprint author), Nanchang Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Affiliated Hosp 2, 1 Minde Rd, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",zhoujianliang2010@163.com,,,"National High-tech Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China [2014AA020539]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81770388, 81860079, 81660070]; Outstanding Young Talent Program of Jiangxi Province [20162BCB23059]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20151BAB205007, 20161BBI90015, 20171ACB21061]; Research Project of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education [150274]","This work was funded by the National High-tech Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China (grant no 2014AA020539), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 81770388, 81860079, and 81660070), the Outstanding Young Talent Program of Jiangxi Province (grant no 20162BCB23059), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (grant nos 20151BAB205007, 20161BBI90015, and 20171ACB21061), and the Research Project of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education (grant no 150274).",,67,0,0,0,0,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1178-2013,,,INT J NANOMED,Int.

The trend in biomaterials research has shifted from biocompatible ""immune-evasive"" biomaterials to ""immune-interactive"" materials that modulate the inflammatory response supporting implant integration as well as improving healing and tissue regeneration. Inflammasomes are large intracellular multiprotein complexes that are key players in host defence during innate immune responses and assemble after recognition of pathogens or danger signals. The process of biomaterial implantation causes injury to tissues that will consequently release danger signals that could be sensed by the inflammasome. There are increasing evidences that the inflammasome has a role in several inflammatory processes, from pathogen clearance to chronic inflammation or tissue repair. Thus, modulation of the inflammasome activity appears as an important target in the development of effective approaches in regenerative medicine. In this review, we discuss the main points of the current understanding on the host response to implanted biomaterials and how the paradigm of ""immune-evasive"" biomaterials has shifted over the last years; the significance of the inflammasome in the inflammatory response to biomaterials; and the growing idea that the immune system is of key importance in an effective tissue repair and regeneration.

The roles of microglia are diverse and essential to the capacity of the nervous system to recover from injury, however sustained inflammation can limit recovery and drive chronic disease processes such as neurodegenerative disorders. When assessing implantable therapeutic devices in the central nervous system, an improved lifetime of the implant is considered achievable through the attenuation of microglial inflammation. Consequently, there is a tremendous underexplored potential in biomaterial and engineered design to modulate neuroinflammation for therapeutic benefit. Several strategies for improving device compatibility reviewed here include: biocompatible coatings, improved designs in finer and flexible shapes to reduce tissue shear-related scarring, and loading of anti-inflammatory drugs. Studies about microglial cell cultures in 3D hydrogels and nanoscaffolds to assess various injuries and disorders are also discussed. A variety of other microglia-targeting treatments are also reviewed, including nanoparticulate systems, cellular backpacks, and gold plinths, with the intention of delivering anti-inflammatory drugs by targeting the phagocytic nature of microglia.

Pure titanium and its alloys are the most commonly used materials for permanent implants in contact with bone. However, implant-related infections remain among the leading reasons for failure. The most critical pathogenic event in the development of infection on biomaterials is biofilm formation, which starts immediately after bacterial adhesion. In the last decade, numerous studies reported the ability of titanium surface modifications and coatings to minimize bacterial adhesion, inhibit biofilm formation and provide effective bacterial killing to protect implanted biomaterials. In the present review, the different strategies to prevent infection onto titanium surfaces are reported: surface modification and coatings by antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, inorganic antibacterial metal elements and antibacterial polymers.

The effects of topological design and processing parameters on the fatigue behaviour of such meta-biomaterials have been studied before. Most studies show that the fatigue life of additively manufactured lattice structures is limited. Post-processing techniques could play a major role in improving the fatigue of these promising biomaterials. This study aims to provide an in-depth investigation into the effects of heat treatments, hot isostatic pressing (HIP), sand blasting, and chemical etching on the microstructure, surface morphology, strength and fatigue resistance of selective laser melted titanium meta-biomaterials. It was found that the combination of microstructural design and surface engineering, induced by HIP and sand blasting respectively, allows to increase the endurance limit of these lattice meta-biomaterials by a factor of two. HIP treatment substantially decreased the internal porosity and transformed the microstructure to a more ductile mixture of alpha + beta phases. Sand blasting allowed to eliminate surface imperfections and induced favourable compressive stress in the surface layer of the struts. Statement of Significance Additively manufactured metallic meta-biomaterials are progressively being used as bone replacement orthopedic implants. While there is a great amount of research related to topological designs and their effect on mechanical (e.g. stiffness), physical (e.g. mass transport), and biological (e.g. osseointegration) properties, fatigue lifetime of such structures remains limited. This study provides fundamental investigation into the combined effect of microstructural design and surface engineering of titanium metabiomaterial, enabled through various post treatment methods ranging from heat treatments to physical and chemical surface modifications. The findings show that fatigue life is significantly improved by applying developed herein novel method, which effortlessly can be used on other bone-mimicking metallic meta-biomaterials.

To address this challenge, our team is developing modular biomaterials termed ""bead foams"", comprised of porous beads synthesized exclusively of extracellular matrix (ECM) and assembled into a cohesive three-dimensional (3-D) network. In the current study, bead foams were fabricated from human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) or commercially-sourced bovine tendon collagen (COL) to explore the effects of ECM composition on human wound edge dermal fibroblasts (weDF) sourced from chronic wound tissues. The DAT and COL bead foams were shown to be structurally similar, but compositionally distinct, containing different levels of glycosaminoglycan content and collagen types IV, V, and VI. In vitro testing under conditions simulating stresses within the chronic wound microenvironment indicated that weDF survival and angiogenic marker expression were significantly enhanced in the DAT bead foams as compared to the COL bead foams. These findings were corroborated through in vivo assessment in a subcutaneous athymic mouse model. Taken together, the results demonstrate that weDF survival and paracrine function can be modulated by the matrix source applied in the design of ECM-derived scaffolds and that the DAT bead foams hold promise as cell-instructive biological wound dressings. Statement of Significance Biological wound dressings derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be designed to promote the establishment of a more permissive microenvironment for healing in the treatment of chronic wounds. In the current work, we developed modular biomaterials comprised of fused networks of porous ECM derived beads fabricated from human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) or commercially-available bovine collagen. The bioscaffolds were designed to be structurally similar to provide a platform for investigating the effects of ECM composition on human dermal fibroblasts isolated from chronic wounds. Testing in in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that cell survival and pro-angiogenic function were enhanced in the adipose-derived bioscaffolds, which contained higher levels of glycosaminoglycans and collagen types IV, V, and VI. Our findings support that the complex matrix composition within DAT can induce a more pro-regenerative cellular response for applications in wound healing. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

In particular, self-assembling histidine-rich proteins benefit from functional plasticity that allows the generation of protein-only nanoparticles for cell targeted drug delivery. However, the rational development of constructs with improved functions is limited by a poor control of the oligomerization process. By exploring cross-interactions between histidine-tagged building blocks, we have identified a critical architectonic role of divalent cations.

Because macrophages play a crucial role in peripheral nerve regeneration and can be phenotypically modulated by topographical cues, we hypothesized that aligned nanofibers might induce the development of macrophage phenotypes that facilitate the regeneration of peripheral nerves. Here, macrophages were seeded on aligned and random poly(L-lactic acid-co-epsilon-caprolactone) nanofibers and their morphology and phenotypes were compared. Aligned nanofibers drastically stimulated macrophage elongation along the nanofibers, and, more importantly, induced the development of a pro-healing macrophage phenotype (M2 type), whereas random nanofibers induced a proinflammatory phenotype (M1 type). Notably, the macrophages polarized by aligned nanofibers potently promoted the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells in vitro. Thus, we constructed nerve-guidance conduits by using aligned and random nanofibers and evaluated their effects on macrophage polarization and nerve regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Our in vivo results showed that the ratio of pro-healing macrophages was again higher in the aligned-nanofiber group, and further that Schwann cell infiltration and axon numbers were 2.0- and 2.84-fold higher in the aligned group than in the random group, respectively. This study demonstrates that nanofiber arrangement differentially regulates macrophage activation and that nerve-guidance conduits constructed from aligned nanofibers markedly facilitate peripheral nerve regeneration at least partly by promoting the pro-healing phenotype in macrophages.

Here, we aim to tackle this issue through the use of cobalt doped silicate microspheres that can sustainably release dual ions (silicate and cobalt) at therapeutically relevant doses. The cobalt was doped up to 2.5 wt% within a sol-gel silicate glass network, and microspheres with the size of similar to 300 mu m were generated by an emulsification method. The cobalt and silicate ions released were shown to synergistically upregulate key angiogenic genes, such as HIF1-alpha, VEGF and the receptor KDR. Moreover, the incorporation of ions promoted the polarization, migration, homing and sprouting angiogenesis of endothelial cells. Neo-vascular formation was significantly higher in the dual-ion delivered microspheres, as evidenced in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model. When cultured with bacterial species, the cobalt-doped microspheres effectively inhibited bacteria growth in both indirect or direct contacts. Of note, the bacteria/endothelial cell coculture model proved the efficacy of dual-ion releasing microcarriers for maintaining the endothelial survivability against bacterial contamination and their cell-cell junction.

Calcium phosphate scaffolds are interesting given their compositional similarity with bone mineral. The majority of studies focus on bone growth in the macropores (>100 mu m) of implanted calcium phosphate scaffolds where bone structures such as osteons and trabeculae can form. However, a growing body of research shows that micropores (<50 mu m) play an important role not only in improving bone growth in the macropores, but also in providing additional space for bone growth. Bone growth in the micropores of calcium phosphate scaffolds offers major mechanical advantages as it improves the mechanical properties of the otherwise brittle materials, further stabilizes the implant, improves load transfer, and generally enhances osteointegration. In this paper, we review evidence in the literature of bone growth into micropores, emphasizing on identification techniques and conditions under which bone components are observed in the micropores. We also review theories on mineralization and propose mechanisms, mediated by cells or not, by which mineralization may occur in the confined micropore space of calcium phosphate scaffolds. Understanding and validating these mechanisms will allow to better control and enhance mineralization in micropores to improve the design and efficiency of bone implants. Statement of Significance The design of synthetic bone scaffolds remains a major focus for engineering solutions to repair damaged and diseased bone. Most studies focus on the design of and growth in macropores (>100 mu m), however research increasingly shows the importance of microporosity (<50 mu m). Micropores provide an additional space for bone growth, which provides multiple mechanical advantages to the scaffold/bone composite. Here, we review evidence of bone growth into micropores in calcium phosphate scaffolds and conditions under which growth occurs in micropores, and we propose mechanisms that enable or facilitate growth in these pores. Understanding these mechanisms will allow researchers to exploit them and improve the design and efficiency of bone implants. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a flexible PSP system based on graphene and biodegradable copolyester poly(CL-co-TOSUO) (PCT), which is synthesized by ring-opening copolymerization of epsilon-caprolactone (CL) and 1,4,8-trioxaspiro-[4,6]-9-undecanone (TOSUO). In this PSP system, graphene acts as conductive layer to connect the electrical signals, while the highly-stretchable linear copolyester with structural transfer temperature (melting temperature of crystals) at 37 degrees C provides an active substrate to sense moderate mechanical and temperature stimuli.

To date, there is no conclusive experimental evidence for how and if this process impacts microbial fitness in the environment. Here, we show how a model organism for manganese oxidation is growth inhibited by nitrite, and that this inhibition is mitigated in the presence of manganese. We show that such manganese-mediated mitigation of nitrite inhibition is dependent on the culture inoculum size, and that manganese oxide (MnOx) forms granular precipitates in the culture, rather than sheaths around individual cells. We provide evidence that MnOx protection involves both its ability to catalyze nitrite oxidation into (nontoxic) nitrate under physiological conditions and its potential role in influencing processes involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, these results demonstrate improved microbial fitness through MnOx deposition in an ecological setting, i.e., mitigation of nitrite toxicity, and point to a key role of MnOx in handling stresses arising from ROS. IMPORTANCE We present here a direct fitness benefit (i.e., growth advantage) for manganese oxide biomineralization activity in Roseobacter sp. strain AzwK-3b, a model organism used to study this process. We find that strain AzwK-3b in a laboratory culture experiment is growth inhibited by nitrite in manganese-free cultures, while the inhibition is considerably relieved by manganese supplementation and manganese oxide (MnOx) formation. We show that biogenic MnOx interacts directly with nitrite and possibly with reactive oxygen species and find that its beneficial effects are established through formation of dispersed MnOx granules in a manner dependent on the population size. These experiments raise the possibility that manganese biomineralization could confer protection against nitrite toxicity to a population of cells. They open up new avenues of interrogating this process in other species and provide possible routes to their biotechnological applications, including in metal recovery, biomaterials production, and synthetic community engineering.","[Zerfass, Christian; Christie-Oleza, Joseph A.; Soyer, Orkun S.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Zerfass, Christian; Christie-Oleza, Joseph A.; Soyer, Orkun S.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr WISB, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Soyer, OS (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England.; Soyer, OS (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr WISB, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",O.Soyer@warwick.ac.uk,,,University of Warwick; Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/K003240/2]; Natural Environment Sciences Research Council (NESRC) [NE/K009044/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [BB/M017982/1],"This work is funded by The University of Warwick and by the Biotechnological and Biological, Natural Environment, and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Councils (BBSRC, NESRC, and EPSRC) under grants BB/K003240/2 (to O.S.S.), NE/K009044/1 (to J.A.C.-O.), and BB/M017982/1 (to the Warwick Integrative Synthetic Biology Centre [WISB]).

Nanohybrid hydrogels are prepared in dilute acetic acid medium using two different types of two-dimensional-layered nanoparticles. Scaffolds are prepared through lyophilization of hydrogels. Highly porous, open, and 3D interconnected morphologies are observed in the nanohybrid scaffolds, as opposed to the thick wall, smaller pore dimension in pure chitosan. The interaction between the nanoparticles and chitosan chains are elucidated using different spectroscopic techniques, which in turn are responsible for the uniform distribution of the nanoparticle in the chitosan matrix. Nanohybrids are found to be highly mechanically stable in both states (hydrogel and scaffold), as compared to pure chitosan because of the good reinforcing ability of 2D nanoparticles. Sustained drug release has been achieved in nanohybrid in vitro, as compared to the pure chitosan hydrogel/scaffold, mainly due to greater interactions between the components and the better barrier effect of 2D nanoparticles. Cytotoxicity of the nanohybrids is verified using NIH 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells for their possible use as controlled drug delivery vehicles. Nanohybrids are found to be nontoxic in nature and more biocompatible as compared to pure chitosan, as observed through cell viability and cell imaging studies. Interestingly, cell growth occurs within the pores of the nanohybrid scaffold, vis-a-vis the surface proliferation noticed in the pure chitosan scaffold. Better biocompatibility, hydrophilic nature, and sustained delivery with location specific cell growth make this nanohybrid hydrogel unique for biomedical uses. The bone regeneration rate is found to be significantly higher for the nanohybrid scaffold as compared to blank/pure chitosan without any side effect, suggesting nanohybrid systems are superior biomaterials.","[Mahanta, Arun Kumar; Senapati, Sudipta; Maiti, Pralay] Banaras Hindu Univ, Indian Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Technol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Pahwal, Pankaj; Krishnamurthy, Sairam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Indian Inst Technol, Neurotherapeut Lab, Dept Pharmaceut Engn & Technol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Hemalatha, Siva] Banaras Hindu Univ, Indian Inst Technol, Dept Pharmaceut, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India","Maiti, P (reprint author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Indian Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Technol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",pmaiti.mst@itbhu.ac.in,,"Maiti, Pralay/0000-0002-6879-3591; Senapati, Sudipta/0000-0002-0867-5980","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi; Science and Engineering Research Board [R&D/SERB/LT/SMST/16/17/06]; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi [02(0074)/12/EMR-II]","A.K.M. acknowledges the receipt of funding from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, in the form of a fellowship.

This study investigated the mechanism of melanocyte spheroid formation by using membranes composed of two hydrophilic polymer-based biomaterials, namely chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Our findings revealed that different spheroid-forming processes occurred on the two biomaterials. Methods: Human melanocytes were provided by the cell bank of the Department of Dermatology, National Taiwan University Hospital. The cell viability was determined through the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Sigma) colorimetric assay. The cell living rate was determined using the trypan blue exclusion test. The amount of fibronectin adsorbed was quantified through Western blot analysis. Statistical significance was calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan's test, and p values <0.05 or <0.01 was considered significant. Results: In the study, the melanocytes attached to, migrated on, and aggregated on the chitosan surface and then formed spheroids. By contrast, on the PVA surface, the melanocytes directly aggregated to form three-dimensional spheres in suspension. The proliferative ability and survival rate of the melanocytes were considerably higher on the chitosan membranes than on the PVA membranes. Conclusion: We concluded that only cell-cell interactions dominated in melanocytes seeded on the PVA membrane, whereas cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions occurred on the chitosan membranes and further enhanced cellular functions. The chitosan-induced spheroids could probably overcome the diffusion and assimilation of trophic factors. Copyright (C) 2018, Formosan Medical Association.

Our results, obtained within the COSMO framework, are based on total energy calculations, and are interpreted in terms of electronegativity differences between the relevant system components.

It describes designing appropriate unit cells (UCs) and mode-shapes to accurately predict mechanical behaviors of soft lattices in the finite-strain range. Lattices are based on three different types of repeating UCs in triangular, square and hexagonal shapes. Generic planar UCs consisting of beam-like structures are simulated to determine overall constitutive behaviors. In this respect, periodic boundary conditions are introduced in the finite-strain regime. Deformations of the unit cells and lattice are described on the basis of non-linear Green strains. Finite element (FE) solutions coupled with the Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equations are developed and solved using an iterative Newton-Raphson method and a multi-scale strategy. Then, the computational tool is applied to analyze lattice structures fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Samples are tested in tension and compression modes in different directions revealing strong non-linear, directional and load-dependent responses. A detailed analysis of small-scale behavior of unit cells is presented. Large-scale and multi-scale FE models are also implemented to simulate experimental results with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Due to the absence of similar results in the literature, this paper would contribute to understanding of hyper-elastic behaviors of lattices at small-scale and be instrumental in the large-scale design and analysis of soft lattice structures.","[Damanpack, A.

To date, PFETs have been employed for the development of flexible displays, radio-frequency identification tags, flexible non-volatile memories, among others. Moreover, due to the above advantages, PFETs can be applied to disposable on-site analytical devices. In that regard, we have developed extended-gate type PFETs with molecular recognition biomaterials for protein sensing in aqueous media. The fabricated PFETs were used to successfully detect glycoproteins (immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and chromogranin A) without any complicated labeling processes. Since our proposed immunoassay, which is performed on the basis of extended-gate type PFETs, is rapid and easy-to-use, PFET will be an attractive platform for on-site monitoring devices in healthcare applications in the near future.","[Minamiki, Tsukuru; Sasaki, Yui; Su, Shiwei; Minami, Tsuyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan","Minami, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",tminami@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Towa Foundation for Food Science and Research; Kanamori Foundation; Tateishi Science and Technology Foundation; Society for Research on Umami Taste; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [16J08092, 17H04882, 17K14489, 18J21190]; Descente and Ishimoto Memorial Foundation for the Promotion of Sports Science","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Towa Foundation for Food Science and Research, the Kanamori Foundation, the Descente and Ishimoto Memorial Foundation for the Promotion of Sports Science, Tateishi Science and Technology Foundation, Society for Research on Umami Taste, and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Nos. 16J08092, 17H04882, 17K14489, and 18J21190).

However, in order to support the development of functional tissue engineering methods, the subfailure biomechanics of the individual cartilage types that comprise joints must be determined. Current methods for analyzing tissues are based on imaging and are therefore unable to profile the strain dependence of mechanical behaviors within different cartilage types. Recently, an analysis technique based on Optical Fiber Polarimetric Elastography (OFPE) has overcome these challenges. OFPE has been used to characterize the different mechanical behaviors of a range of unprocessed biomaterials and tissues. In the present work, this technique is used to characterize the biomechanics of both articular cartilage and meniscal fibrocartilage within a porcine knee. OFPE testing of the tissue is conducted over a range of physiological loading and unloading values. These results demonstrate the distinctive mechanics of each cartilage type. Due to their different locations within the knee, each cartilage type exhibits distinctly unique biomechanical behavior. Based on the results of OFPE, we correlate the specific buckling, delamination, and bridging events to maxima and minima along the loading and unloading curves. This provides unprecedented detail with regard to the subfailure biomechanics. This information is integral to the design of the next generation of tissue-engineered constructs. Therefore, OFPE will be used across multiple disciplines to rapidly determine the mechanical behavior of tissue-engineered constructs to support functional tissue engineering efforts.","[Hudnut, Alexa W.; Armani, Andrea M.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biomed Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Trasolini, Nicholas A.; Hatch, George F.

During the last ten years, significant progress has been achieved in the development of various organ manufacturing technologies. According to the degree of automation, organ manufacturing technologies can be divided into three main groups: (1) fully automated; (2) semi-automated; (3) handworked (or handmade); each has the advantages and disadvantages for bioartificial organ manufacturing. One of the most promising bioartificial organ manufacturing technologies is to use combined multi-nozzle three-dimensional printing techniques to automatically assemble personal cells along with other biomaterials to build exclusive organ substitutes for defective/failed human organs.

Methods: Between April 2016 and March 2018, five patients required anterior maxillary alveolar ridge augmentation using fixation with u-HA/PLLA screws for an onlay block bone graft harvested from the mandibular ramus at our institute. Bone biopsies were obtained from the dental implantation site following bone healing for histomorphometric and immunohistochemical (IHC) measurements. Results: Many stromal cells were positive for Osterix, RUNX2, and SOX9 but were negative for CD68. On cell counting, based on IHC staining for Osterix, RUNX2, SOX9 and CD68 from peripheral u-HA/PLLA screw or bone areas, both areas consistently showed no significant difference in terms of Osterix, RUNX2, and SOX9. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed direct bone connection to the biomaterials, and no inflammatory cells infiltrated the areas surrounding the bone or artificial material. Area between the bone and u-HA/PLLA screw was seamless with no boundary. Round small cells and immature fibroblasts were noted. The new bone showed the presence of bone lamellae, normal osteocytes, and osteoblasts. Conclusion: The u-HA/PLLA materials showed excellent biodegradability and bioactive osteoconductivity. In addition, this material induced no apparent inflammatory or foreign body reactions following implantation, and it directly bonded to the human bone. Therefore, this u-HA/PLLA material seems ideal and most suitable for use as a substitute for osteosynthesis.","[Sukegawa, Shintaro; Kanno, Takahiro; Furuki, Yoshihiko] Kagawa Prefectural Cent Hosp, Div Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, 1-2-1 Asahi Cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7608557, Japan; [Kawai, Hotaka; Nakano, Keisuke; Takabatake, Kiyofumi; Nagatsuka, Hitoshi] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Med Dent & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Oral Pathol & Med, Okayama, Japan; [Kanno, Takahiro] Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Matsue, Shimane, Japan","Sukegawa, S (reprint author), Kagawa Prefectural Cent Hosp, Div Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, 1-2-1 Asahi Cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7608557, Japan.",gouwan19@gmail.com,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [26462783, 16K20577]","This study was jointly funded by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 26462783, 16K20577.",,29,0,0,0,0,IVYSPRING INT PUBL,LAKE HAVEN,"PO BOX 4546, LAKE HAVEN, NSW 2263, AUSTRALIA",1449-1907,,,INT J MED SCI,Int.

The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize evidence from existing human and animal studies assessing the application of 3D printing on bone repair and regeneration in the craniofacial region. Data & sources: A rigorous search of all relevant clinical trials and case series was performed, based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search was conducted in all available electronic databases and sources, supplemented by a manual search, in December 2017. Study selection: 43 articles (6 human and 37 animal studies) fulfilled the criteria. The human studies included totally 81 patients with craniofacial bone defects. Titanium or hydroxylapatite scaffolds were most commonly implanted. The follow-up period ranged between 6 and 24 months. Bone repair was reported successful in nearly every case, with minimal complications. Also, animal intervention studies used biomaterials and cells in various combination, offering insights into the techniques, through histological, biochemical, histomorphometric and microcomputed tomographic findings. The results in both humans and animals, though promising, are yet to be verified for clinical impact. Conclusions: Future research should be focused on well-designed clinical trials to confirm the short- and long-term efficacy of 3D printing strategies for craniofacial bone repair. Clinical significance: Emerging 3D printing technology opens a new era for tissue engineering. Humans and animals on application of 3D printing for craniofacial bone repair showed promising results which will lead clinicians to investigate more thoroughly alternative therapeutic methods for craniofacial bone defects.","[Maroulakos, Michael; Ren, Yijin] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Orthodont, Groningen, Netherlands; [Kamperos, George] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Athens, Greece; [Tayebi, Lobat] Marquette Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Res, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Halazonetis, Demetrios] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Orthodont, Athens, Greece","Ren, YJ (reprint author), 117 Ionias Rd, Alimos 17456, Greece.",y.ren@umcg.nl,,,,,,102,0,0,22,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0300-5712,1879-176X,,J DENT,J.

Nanowires created from polymers, silver, zinc, copper, nickel, and aluminum have been used as reinforcing agents in conducting polymers and non-conducting thermoplastic/thermoset matrices such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, polyurethane, acrylic polymers, polystyrene, epoxy and rubbers. This review presents the combined influence of polymer matrix and nanowires on the nanocomposite characteristics. This review shows how the nanowire, the nanofiller content, the matrix type and processing conditions affect the final nanocomposite properties. The ensuing multifunctional polymer/nanowire nanocomposites have high strength, conductivity, thermal stability, and other useful photovoltaic, piezo, and sensing properties. The remarkable nanocomposite characteristics have been ascribed to the ordered nanowire structure and the development of a strong interface between the matrix/nanofiller. This review also refers to cutting edge application areas of polymer/nanowire nanocomposites such as solar cells, light emitting diodes, supercapacitors, sensors, batteries, electromagnetic shielding materials, biomaterials, and other highly technical fields. Modifying nanowires and incorporating them in a suitable polymer matrix can be adopted as a powerful future tool to create useful technical applications.","[Kausar, Ayesha] NUST, Sch Nat Sci, H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan","Kausar, A (reprint author), NUST, Sch Nat Sci, H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan.",asheesgreat@yahoo.com,,,,,,141,0,0,20,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",8756-0879,1530-8014,,J PLAST FILM SHEET,J.

Amyloids, which were historically associated with diseases, have recently been recognized as a biological structure that performs vital physiological functions in host organisms, highlighting their potential as life-inspired assemblies. Amyloids are highly organized proteinaceous assemblies characterized by a cross-beta-sheet quaternary conformation. The mechanical, physical, and biological properties of amyloids suggest that these nanostructures hold great potential as soft materials, nanoparticles, and biomatrices. This potential is associated with many characteristics, including the spontaneous self-assembly of many polypeptide sequences, high mechanical resistance, biocompatibility, biodegradability as well as thermal, chemical, and enzymatic stability. Moreover, peptide-based amyloid assemblies can efficiently be obtained by standard solid phase peptide synthesis and orthogonally functionalized with a wide range of biomolecules, such as large proteins and DNA. In this review, after briefly introducing the amyloid structure and the mechanisms of self-assembly, we describe approaches to identify and design short self-assembling amyloidogenic peptides.

Our previous work has shown the possibility of producing a byssus protein hydrolyzate with good film-forming ability, providing a promising new avenue for the preparation of biomaterials. Materials prepared from regenerated fibrous proteins often need additional treatments to reach the performance required for targeted applications. Here, we studied the effect of covalent crosslinking, using a carbodiimide or glutaraldehyde, on the mechanical properties and enzymatic resistance of byssus-based materials. The results show that the mechanical properties of the films can be tuned, and that a higher crosslinking degree leads to increases in modulus and strength accompanied by a loss of extensibility. Structural analysis performed by infrared spectroscopy revealed that crosslinking induces an unexpected transition from aggregated strands to hydrated collagen/ PPII-related helical structures. The materials were nevertheless more resistant to collagenase degradation as a result of higher crosslinking density.

Among the several microalgae investigated for biomaterials production, Euglena spp. are particularly attractive due to their easiness to grow in cultures and the ability to produce numerous bioactive compounds through extremely complex metabolic pathways. The genus Euglena comprises more than 300 species of unicellular, predominantly freshwater flagellates of worldwide distribution. The plastids in Euglena cells have been recognized as a site of the production of proteins, fatty acids, and many other value-added metabolites. Euglena is one of the few microorganisms that simultaneously produces antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, L-ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol, along with wax esters, phytotoxins and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), that are useful in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and nutraceuticals. Nevertheless, the biotechnological potency of Euglena for industrial production has been exploited limitedly. This review summarizes the major value-added compounds obtained from the protist genus Euglena and their potential and prospects for commercial production.","[Kottuparambil, Sreejith; Agusti, Susana] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Thankamony, Roshni Lilly] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Phys Sci & Engn, Adv Membranes & Porous Mat Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Kottuparambil, S (reprint author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.",sreejith.kottuparambil@kaust.edu.sa,,"Kottuparambil, Sreejith/0000-0002-2480-7568",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST),We are indebted to King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) for the financial support.,,94,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-9264,,,ALGAL RES,Algal Res.,JAN,2019,37,,,,,,154.0,159,,10.1016/j.algal.2018.11.024,,,,6,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,HG1OS,WOS:000454728200018,,,,,2019-02-25

Despite significant progress in obtaining biomaterials from praying mantis, antiherpetic activity of T. angustipennis eggs is not well defined. In this study, we characterized the crude extracts from T. angustipennis eggs using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methods. Inhibition of cell proliferation by mantis egg extracts and isolated components was investigated on lymphocytes in a MTT assay. Furthermore, the effects of egg extracts against the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain KOS (HSV-1 KOS) were evaluated in a mouse model. The HPLC and GC/MS results showed that the extracts are mainly composed of stearic acid monoterpenes, octadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, and propionic acid. Investigation on the immunomodulatory effects of the extracted components following infection of mice with HSV-1 KOS virus showed an increase in serum interferon-gamma level (26.01 +/- 5.21 vs. 18.67 +/- 3.23pg/mL, respectively) and interleukin-10 level (106.64 +/- 4.13 vs. 48.04 +/- 3.12pg/mL, respectively) in test and control groups (for both p<0.05). It indicates that the mantis egg components have shifted the cytokines induction to the anti-inflammatory arm and probably truncated inflammation caused by HSV-1 KOS virus. Our findings can be considered as an early attempt to reveal the comprehensive biological properties of T. angustipennis eggs as new anti-inflammatory components in future pharmaceutical investigations.","[Zand, Ali Mohammad; Saadati, Mojtaba; Zargan, Jamil] IHU, Basic Sci Fac, Dept Biol, Tehran, Iran","Zand, AM (reprint author), IHU, Basic Sci Fac, Dept Biol, Tehran, Iran.",kpazand@ihu.ac.ir,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0006-3088,1336-9563,,BIOLOGIA,Biologia,JAN,2019,74,1,,,,,45.0,51,,10.2478/s11756-018-0111-9,,,,7,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,HG2FW,WOS:000454779700005,,,,,2019-02-25

Effects of the BT reinforcement and storage time on the morphology, water content, and mechanical properties of the related TPS nanocomposites are investigated on compression molded specimens. Morphology change is followed by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements. The presence of BT increases the rate of transformation from A- to V-type crystalline form. It is also found that BT particles hinders the recrystallization (retrogradation) of TPS. BT becomes intercalated in TPS, which is supported by the water used as additional plasticizer for the compounding of maize starch. According to gravimetric measurements, TPS samples lose part of their water content during retrogradation/aging. Both the incorporation of BT and the time of aging result in increased strength and stiffness, however at the cost of elongation at break. This is associated with enhanced strength and stiffness, which is ascribed to a change (from more to less hydrated) in the interphase. According to scanning electron and atomic force microscopy analysis, the reinforcing BT particles are homogenously dispersed on nano and micron scale within the TPS matrix.","[Lendvai, Laszlo; Karger-Kocsis, Jozsef] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Polymer Engn, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Lendvai, Laszlo] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, Egyet Ter 1, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary; [Sajo, Istvan] Univ Pecs, Szentagothai Res Ctr, Ifjusag Utja 20, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Karger-Kocsis, Jozsef] MTA BME Res Grp Composite Sci & Technol, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary","Lendvai, L (reprint author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Polymer Engn, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.; Lendvai, L (reprint author), Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, Egyet Ter 1, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary.",lendvai@pt.bme.hu,,,Hungarian Research Fund (OTKA) [K 109409],The work reported here was supported by the Hungarian Research Fund (OTKA) through the project K 109409.,,31,0,0,2,2,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0038-9056,1521-379X,,STARCH-STARKE,Starch-Starke,JAN,2019,71,1-2,,,,,,,1800123,10.1002/star.201800123,,,,8,Food Science & Technology,Food Science & Technology,HG1IZ,WOS:000454708500028,,,,,2019-02-25

Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 25 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and 25 healthy individuals were assayed for cluster of differentiation14(+) (CD14(+)) expression and monocytes were induced to differentiate into osteoclasts for 21 days in-vitro in the presence of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL). We assessed the number of osteoclasts by tartrate-acid resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positivity. The mechanism of apoptosis was studied with reference to expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL, nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B), caspase 3/9 and DNA fragmentation. Results We observed a relative increase in the proportion of circulating osteoclasts in test group than control group (healthy individuals). In addition, osteoclast precursors in untreated cells (CP) were more osteoclastogenic as compared to cells treated with PRF/BCP and hence, there was a significant increase in the number of osteoclasts in CP. In PRF/BCP treated cells, we found a direct inhibition of transcription factor NF-kappa B with an increased caspase 3/9 levels and caspase 3 activity. Additionally, the protein expression and transcriptional profile of Bax was upregulated and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels were down-regulated on treatment with PRF/BCP. Conclusion Our results revealed that the PRF/BCP displayed an inhibitory role in osteoclasts formation and its molecular mechanism of action was related to the apoptosis induction through intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.","[Kumar, Anil; Mahendra, Jaideep] Meenakshi Ammal Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Periodont, Alapakkam Main Rd, Madras 600095, Tamil Nadu, India; [Samuel, Shila; Loganathan, Tholcopiyan; Vashum, Yaongamphi; Krishnamoorthy, Thiagarajan] Univ Madras, Dept Biochem, VRR Inst Biomed Sci, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Govindraj, Jayamathi] Meenakshi Ammal Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Biochem, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mahendra, Little] Annamalai Univ, Dept Periodont, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India","Mahendra, J (reprint author), Meenakshi Ammal Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Periodont, Alapakkam Main Rd, Madras 600095, Tamil Nadu, India.",jaideep_m_23@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,48,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-3492,1943-3670,,J PERIODONTOL,J.

Despite decades of development and their status as the restorative material of choice for dentists, resin composite restoratives and adhesives exhibit a number of short-comings that limit their long-term survival in the oral cavity. Herein we review past and current work to understand these challenges and approaches to improve dental materials and extend restoration service life. Methods. Peer-reviewed work from a number of researchers as well as our own are summarized and analyzed. We also include yet-unpublished work of our own. Challenges to dental materials, methods to assess new materials, and recent material improvements and research directions are presented. Results. Mechanical stress, host- and bacterial-biodegradation, and secondary caries formation all contribute to restoration failure. In particular, several host- and bacterial-derived enzymes degrade the resin and collagen components of the hybrid layer, expanding the marginal gap and increasing access to bacteria and saliva. Furthermore, the virulence of cariogenic bacteria is up-regulated by resin biodegradation by-products, creating a positive feedback loop that increases biodegradation. These factors work synergistically to degrade the restoration margin, leading to secondary caries and restoration failure. Significant progress has been made to produce hydrolytically stable resins to resist biodegradation, as well as antimicrobial materials to reduce bacterial load around the restoration. Ideally, these two approaches should be combined in a holistic approach to restoration preservation. Significance. The oral cavity is a complex environment that poses an array of challenges to long-term material success; materials testing conditions should be comprehensive and closely mimic pathogenic oral conditions.

Tooth enamel has unsurpassed hardness and stiffness among mammalian tissue structures. Such stiff materials are usually brittle, yet mature enamel can survive for a life- time. Understanding the nanoscale origin of enamel durability is important for developing advanced load-bearing biomaterials. Here, nanoscale exceptional contact elasticity of the human tooth enamel, based on nanoindentation tests, is reported. Methods. Spherical indenter tips with radii of 243 and 1041 nm were used to determine stress-strain curves of enamel. Force-displacement curves were recorded using quasi-static loading strain rates of 0.031, 0.041, and 0.061 s(-1). The storage moduli from a superimposed signal amplitude (dynamic strain at 220 Hz) embedded during primary quasi-static loading and from quasi-static elastic theory were simultaneously measured. Modulus mapping was considered to be an extremely low quasi-static loading strain rate indentation test. Results. The elastic limits were 7-9 GPa and 5-6 GPa for the small and large indenters, respectively. The elastic-plastic transition point and elastic modulus value increased with substantially increased quasi-static loading strain rate. The results suggested that the increase of the elastic limit during high-loading strain was associated with exceptional con- tact elasticity at the nanoscale of the enamel structure and the consequent extension of the contact area (i.e., a temporary pile-up response, dependent on the enamel nanocrystals and protein glue). Significance. Structural modification at this scale effectively prevents the initiation of cracking from localized strain, thus reinforcing the bulk structure. These results may provide valuable insight for conceptualizing bio-inspired nanocomposites. (C) 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cellular responses including cell death are induced by in vitro exposure to the un-polymerized dental monomer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). Activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway has been suggested to mediate the cellular responses. Activation of this pathway may occur either indirectly through generation of increased oxidative stress or through direct binding to cysteine thiols due to the electrophilic properties of HEMA. The objective of this study was to elucidate the potential mechanism of Nrf2/ARE pathway activation after HEMA exposure. Methods. Global gene expression was investigated after exposure of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B to 2 mM HEMA for 4h. After exposure to 0.5, 1 or 2 mM HEMA for up to 24h, western analysis was performed for selected proteins. Finally, the levels of the same proteins were determined after treatment with either the antioxidants Vitamin C, Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) or BSO (L-buthioninesulfoximine), an inhibitor of GSH formation. Results. Several of the 25 genes with the highest increase in gene transcription are related to oxidative stress responses. Increased levels of 5 corresponding proteins (HO-1, GCLC, GCLM, NQO1 and SQSTM1) were observed. Antioxidant treatment as well as inhibition of GSH did not affect upregulation of these proteins. Thus, increased ROS or reduced GSH levels appear to be of limited importance in the observed HEMA-induced changes. Significance. Knowledge of the cellular responses to HEMA is important to evaluate the safety of HEMA-containing biomaterials. The results support that HEMA activates the Nrf2-ARE transcriptional pathway directly through its electrophilic properties. (C) 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Roughened dental implants promote mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) osteoblastic differentiation, and hydrophilic modifications induce anti-inflammatory macrophages activation. While the effect of different surface modifications on osseointegration of commercial dental implants have been compared in vivo and clinically, the initial cellular response to these modifications often overlooked. We aimed to characterize the macrophage inflammatory response and MSC osteogenesis across different commercially available implants in vitro. Methods. Six commercially available rough implants [OsseoSpeed (TM) (Astra-Tech (TM), Implant A); Osseotite (R) (Biomet 3i (TM), Implant B); TiUnite (TM) (Nobel-Biocare (R), Implant C); Ti-SLA (R), (Implant D), Roxolid (R) (RXD-SLA, Implant E), RXD-SLActive (R) (Implant F) (Straumann (R))] were examined. Macrophages and MSCs were seeded directly on implants and cultured in custom vials. mRNA and protein levels of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL17A, CXCL10, TNFa) and anti- (IL4, IL10, TGFB1) inflammatory markers were measured after 24 and 48 h in macrophages. Osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs was assessed after seven days by alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin, and angiogenic, osteogenic, and inflammatory markers by ELISA and qPCR (n = 6/variable, ANOVA, post hoc Tukey HSD with alpha = 0.05). Results. Hydrophilic implant F induced the highest level of osteogenic factor released from MSCs and anti-inflammatory factors from macrophages with the lowest level of pro-inflammatory factors. Alternatively, implants A and C supported lower levels of osteogenesis and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. Significance. In this study, we successfully evaluated differences in cell response to commercially available clinical implants using an in vitro model.

Recently, investigations into the transitions that occur during cellular specification, differentiation, maturation, and disease responses have provided insights into understanding the mechanisms that underlie these altered states of reactivity and function. Here we summarize current concepts in how astrocyte state transitions, termed astroplasticity, are regulated, as well as how this affects neural circuit function through extracellular signaling. We postulate that a promising future approach toward enhancing functional repair after injury and disease would be to steer astrocytes away from an inhibitory response and toward one that is beneficial to neuroplasticity and neuroregeneration. Toward this goal, we discuss emerging biotechnological advancements, with a focus on human pluripotent stem cell bioengineering, which has high potential for effective manipulation and control of astroplasticity. Highlights include innovations in cellular transdifferentiation techniques, nanomedicine, organoid and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid microcircuit development, and the use of biomaterials to influence the extracellular environment. Current barriers and future applications are also summarized in order to augment the design of future preclinical trials aimed toward astrocyte-targeted neuroregeneration with a concept termed astrocellular therapeutics.

At present, the pressure of compaction of this material in the recipient bone is manual, dependent on the clinician, although there is some scientific evidence on the effects of different compressive forces on angiogenesis and prognosis of the regeneration of the grafted areas. The aim of the present study is to design, calibrate and verify in vitro a compaction instrument for clinical use, which allows a controlled and precise compaction pressure of the particulate graft biomaterial and standardize the procedure. The designed instrument is a precision compactor of adequate size for proper intra and extraoral clinical manageability and manufactured in a sterilizable material by autoclaving. The range of compression that allows (0 -1,82 Newton), is within the forces that are commonly applied in surgery and that have been determined by a specific test on 8 oral surgeons. Instrument calibration has been performed by an independent accredited company. The testing of the instrument was carried out by an in vitro test where the biomaterial was compacted at different forces (0,80 and 1,82 Newton) and was observed by a computerized micro-tomography that when increasing the compression force, decreased the space between particles provided for the migration and proliferation of new blood vessels and cells.","[Brizuela-Velasco, Aritza; Jimenez-Garrudo, Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Sch Med, Alfonso X el Sabio S-N, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Viteri-Agustin, Iratxe; Perez-Pevida, Esteban; Montalban-Vadillo, Oier; Bellanco-de la Pinta, Iker] Univ Zaragoza, Sch Hlth Sci & Sports, Univ Pl 2, Huesca 22002, Spain; [Chavarri-Prado, David; Dieguez-Pereira, Markel] Univ Oviedo, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Av Julian Claveria S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Solaberrieta-Mendez, Eneko] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Ingeniery Sch Gipuzkoa, Graph Design & Projects Dept, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Manuel Lou-Bonafonte, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Sch Hlth Sci & Sports, Hlth Res Inst Aragon, Huesca 22002, Spain","Brizuela-Velasco, A (reprint author), Univ Salamanca, Sch Med, Alfonso X el Sabio S-N, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",,,,,,,26,0,0,2,2,FEDERACION ASOCIACIONES INGENIEROS INDUSTRIALES ESPANA,BILBAO,"ALAMEDA DE MAZARREDO, BILBAO, 69-48009, SPAIN",0012-7361,1989-1490,,DYNA-BILBAO,Dyna,JAN,2019,94,1,,,,,,,,10.6036/8858,,,,11,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Engineering,HG0JO,WOS:000454630100013,,,,,2019-02-25

However, the addition of keratin into the blend nanofiber would decrease the mechanical properties of nanofibers due to the poor spinnability of keratin, and caused inhomogeneous distribution of keratin inside the nanofibers. Therefore, polymeric nanofibers surface-modified with keratin nanoparticles would improve the hydrophility and mechanical property. In this study, keratose (oxidative keratin, KOS) nanoparticles-coating PVA nanofibers (KNPs/PVA) were fabricated by electrospray deposition after electrospinning and acted on neural cells. The chemical conformation, mechanical properties and wettability of KNPs/PVA nanofibers were characterized. The KNPs/PVA nanofibers provided better wettability and stronger mechanical properties compared to KOS/PVA blend nanofibers at the same mass ratio of KOS to PVA. Furthermore, KNPs/PVA nanofibers displayed better cyto-biocompatibility in terms of cell morphology, adhesion and proliferation compared with PVA nanofibers and KOS/PVA blend nanofibers. These results suggested that polymeric nanofibers surface-modified with KOS nanoparticles can provide superior wettability, mechanical properties and biocompatibility by comparison with the blend nanofibers.

Considering that a combination of alginate di-aldehyde and gelatin (ADA-GEL) has been successfully applied for different biofabrication approaches, the aim of this study was to exploit ADA-GEL for the fabrication of vessel structures with diameters up to 4mm. To explore plotting possibilities and to study the swelling behaviour, a library of vessel-like constructs with different diameters made from 2, 3 and 4% (w/v) alginate was created by using various hand-crafted double-needle extrusion systems. Vessel diameters were varied through changes of the double-needle core and outer diameters. A straightforward model for the production of vessel of different diameters from a variety of double-needle systems was established and vessel-constructs with diameters of up to 3.7mm could be created. It was successfully demonstrated that an artificial vessel, consisting of an outer layer of 7.5% ADA50-GEL50 and an inner core of 3% gelatin, can support the proliferation and migration of an immobilized co-culture containing fibroblast (NHDF) and endothelial (HUVEC) cells. The openness and tightness of the hollow ADA-GEL structures were further confirmed by a dye injection test. Nanoindentation was performed to determine the Young's modulus of the used materials. Cell vitality was proved after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of incubation. The results showed a nearly twofold increase of viable cells per week. Fluorescent images confirmed cell migration during the whole incubation time. [GRAPHICS] .","[Ruther, F.; Distler, T.; Boccaccini, A.

Appropriate mechanical stimuli can further promote this osteoconductive behaviour.

This paper aims to compare and evaluate mechanical environment of TiO2 scaffold with three commercial CaP biomaterials, i.e. Bio-Oss, Cerabone and Maxresorb under simulated perfusion culture conditions. The solid phase and fluid phase were modelled as linear elastic material and Newtonian fluid, respectively. The mechanical stimulus was analysed within these porous scaffolds quantitatively. The results showed that the TiO2 had nearly heterogeneous stress distributions, however lower effective Young's modulus than Cerabone and Maxresorb. The permeability and wall shear stress (WSS) for the TiO2 scaffold was significantly higher than other commercial bone substitute materials. Maxresorb and Bio-Oss showed lowest permeability and local areas of very high WSS. The detailed description of the mechanical performance of these scaffolds could help researchers to predict cell behaviour and to select the most appropriate scaffold for different in vitro and in vivo performances.","[Zhang, Xianbin; Tiainen, Hanna; Haugen, Havard J.] Univ Oslo, Inst Clin Dent, Dept Biomat, POB 1109, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Zhang, Xianbin] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Automot Simulat & Control, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xianbin] Jilin Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Nanling Campus, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China","Haugen, HJ (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Inst Clin Dent, Dept Biomat, POB 1109, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",zxb19851219@gmail.com; hanna.tiainen@odont.uio.no; h.j.haugen@odont.uio.no,,"Haugen, Havard Jostein/0000-0002-6690-7233; Tiainen, Hanna/0000-0003-2757-6213",Research Council of Norway [228415]; UNINETT Sigma2 AS [NN9371K]; China Scholarship Council (CSC),"This study was supported by the Research Council of Norway (grant 228415), UNINETT Sigma2 AS which manages the national infrastructure for computational science in Norway and offers services in high-performance computing and data storage (grant number NN9371K) and FEM analysis of novel bone graft substitutes and grant from the China Scholarship Council (CSC).",,53,0,0,9,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0140-0118,1741-0444,,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,Med.

The ideal treatment for cervical spondylodiscitis (CSD) remains unclear. METHODS Hospital records of patients who underwent acute surgical management for CSD were reviewed. Information about preoperative neurological status, surgical treatment, perk and postoperative processes, antibiotic treatment, repeated procedure, and neurological status at follow-up examination were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 30 consecutive patients (17 male and 13 female) were included in this retrospective study. The mean age at procedures was 68.1 years (range 50-82 years), with mean of 6 coexisting comorbidities. Preoperatively neck pain was noted in 21 patients (70.0%), arm pain in 12 (40.0%), a paresis in 12 (40.0%), sensory deficit in 8 (26.7%), tetraparesis in 6 (20%), a septicemia in 4 (13.3%). Preoperative MRI scan revealed a CSD in one-level fusion in 21 patients (70.0%), in two-level fusions in 7 patients (23.3%), and in three-level fusions in 2 patients (6.7%). In 16 patients an antibiotic treatment was initiated prior to surgical treatment. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with cervical plating (ACDF+CP) was performed in 17 patients and anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) in 12 patients. Additional posterior decompression was performed in one case of ACDF+CP and additional posterior fixation in ten cases of ACCF procedures. Three patients died due to multiple organ failure (10%). Revision surgery was performed in 6 patients (20.7%) within the first 2 weeks postoperatively. All patients received antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks. At the first follow-up (mean 3 month) no recurrent infection was detected on blood workup and MRI scans. At final follow-up (mean 18 month), all patients reported improvement of neck pain, all but one patients were free of radicular pain and had no sensory deficits, and all patients showed improvement of motor strength. One patient with preoperative tetraparesis was able to ambulate. CONCLUSIONS CSD is a disease that is associated with severe neurological deterioration. Anterior cervical surgery with radical debridement and appropriate antibiotic treatment achieves complete healing. Anterior cervical plating with the use of polyetheretherketone cages has no negative effect of the healing process. Posterior fixation is recommended following ACCF procedures.","Saarland Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Homburg, Germany; [Burkhardt, Benedikt W.] Saarland Univ, Fac Med, Homburg, Germany","Burkhardt, BW (reprint author), Saarland Univ, Fac Med, Homburg, Germany.; Burkhardt, BW (reprint author), Univ Saarland, Univ Klinikum Saarlandes, Klin Neurochirurg, Homburg, Germany.",burkhardt@gmail.com,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS,ROLLING MEADOWS,"5550 MEADOWBROOK DRIVE, ROLLING MEADOWS, IL 60008 USA",1092-0684,,,NEUROSURG FOCUS,Neurosurg.

A PLA-grafted maleic anhydride (PLA-g-MA) masterbatch containing 10 wt% PLA-g-MA was obtained by reactive extrusion and was further used, after dilution, as a coupling agent. In addition, three PLA masterbatches containing 10 wt% of three different grades of nanoclays, one untreated nanoclay and two organonanoclays, were also compounded. In a subsequent extrusion step, the nanoclay masterbatches were diluted in PLA down to 4 and 2 wt% while simultaneously incorporating in each one 20 wt% of short flax fibers. Those bio-nanocomposites were compounded without and with an equivalent content of PLA-g-MA, that is, with 4 and 2 wt%, respectively, through the dilution of 10 wt% PLA-g-MA masterbatch. The effects of the nanoclay chemistries, PLA-g-MA, and of flax fibers presence on the properties of bio-nanocomposite hybrid materials were investigated. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, rheology, mechanical properties (tension, flexural, and Izod impact), and reprocess ability tests were used to characterize the bio-nanocomposite hybrid materials. In a second step, PLA-g-MA was replaced by an epoxy/styrene/acrylic copolymer for comparison purpose of their respective effect in bio-nanocomposite performances. Mechanical properties of bio-nanocomposites containing the second coupling agent were also evaluated. The effect of the epoxy/styrene/acrylic copolymer is discussed in comparison with the effect of PLA-g-MA.","[Mihai, Mihaela; Minh-Tan Ton-That] Natl Res Council Canada, Polymer Bioprod Automot & Surface Transportat, Boucherville, PQ, Canada","Mihai, M (reprint author), Natl Res Council Canada, Automot & Surface Transportat, 75 Mortagne, Boucherville, PQ J4B 6Y4, Canada.",mihaela.mihai@cnrc-nrc.gc.ca,,,Agriculture Agri-Food Canada; CTBI Network through the ABIP research program,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Agriculture Agri-Food Canada for the CTBI Network through the ABIP research program.",,29,1,1,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0892-7057,1530-7980,,J THERMOPLAST COMPOS,J.
